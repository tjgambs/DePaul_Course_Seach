He is a new professor, so he is still finding what works for him. But, in response to the previous comment, I think he repeats himself because the concepts aren't always easy and most people in the class stare blankly into space, so he probably feels like people aren't getting it. He's great and I would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>terrible. says the same thing ten different ways. goes off on boring tangents. his lectures are more frustrating than boring. is really knowledgable but terrible as a lecturer. dont ask a question because you will get a twenty minute answer. DO NOT TAKE.</div></div></div></body></html>
