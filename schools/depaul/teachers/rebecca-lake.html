She is very helpful, forgiving, and extremely knowledgable on the subject matter.  Amazing experience.

The topic of the class is a bit hard, but the way she teachers is very effective and she gives you the tools to do well!  Her class is the best class I have taken at DePaul so far.  The information i learned I will carry with me into my future classes and my career as a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: METHODS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>just awful</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2005<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lake is a very good teacher.  Even though the topic of research is quite dull, you will learn about it because her teaching methods are so effective. She is a little quirky, but it makes her cute and fun to be around.  Also, at the start of the quarter, it seems like the work load is high, but it is surprisingly do-able.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2005<br>Class Name: TL410<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She expects a lot from the students in her class, but I learned a lot about educational research.  I feel a lot more confident about conducting research and my writing skills after taking this course.  She has conducted research worldwide so she does know what she is talking about.  She was also accomodating with the length of the assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2005<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really shouldn't be teaching.  She is rude and unhelpful- and seems to pride herself on causing confusion. She finds it amusing in a sadistic way.  She should look into another career- DePaul is no place for ineffective professors.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
