It included good topics and good discussion due to the small class size, but overall, it wasn't an AMAZING class.  Kind of blah...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: PR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice guy and great at pr. Class was hard to understand and got confusing at times. Quizzes and tests are easy if you read, tests are easy if you read and project was time consuming but fun. overall: good teacher but not the best i've had! i would recommend him if you want to focus!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2004<br>Class Name: PR<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, Dave is a great person and a great advocate for PR. I am a bit miffed that we did not get our projects (that our groups worked SOOO hard on) back in time to access them with our groups. Also, memorize your notes the day you take them...weekly quizzes are EXTREMELY PICKY.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: PR<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor DeVries is an excellent PR practitioner, but an awful teacher. He knows what he is talking about, but wastes serious amounts of class time having to clarify what he lectures on. Don't advise taking his class.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
