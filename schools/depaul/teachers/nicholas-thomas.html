He is engaging, cares about your success, and he invests in your future. . .if you let him.  This was only an introductory course but he made me feel like it was one of the more important classes of my career as a student.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2015<br>Class Name: HSP505<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Nick is probably the best professor I've had at DePaul.  This is not the fist class I've had him for and it definitely won't be the last.  He loves what he does and he is extremely knowledgeable about the Hospitality Industry.  He makes sure you learn everything he has to offer you and his classes are always entertaining.  Please take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2015<br>Class Name: HSP502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Nick was clear with assignments and expectations.  I really enjoyed his lectures and really wish I didn't have to take this class online.  There was a lot of discussion on the discussion boards, but for me it's not the same as being in a classroom.  Take his class if you have the opportunity!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2015<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. Makes the simple 100 level class very interesting. He is funny and interesting, made me happy I chose Hospitality for my minor. Super easy class, three exams - gives us all the questions beforehand - and lots of extra credit. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: HSP203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great course, and an even better professor! I would take Dr. Nick over and over again for a HSP course. He's a great guy, knows his stuff, and always has engaging lectures. Definitely recommend. Do your work and you'll receive the A. Just be sure to do your work and submit it by the deadline!! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: HSP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Professor Thomas for numerous classes! He is the best. Might think twice about buying books... i bought a couple that are still in the wrappers. Highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2013<br>Class Name: HSP201202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor and definitely my favorite at DePaul!

He wants students to learn about Hospitality Management in a very entertaining way.  His experience in the hospitality management field is quite reputable, and I think his experience makes him the best fit for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2013<br>Class Name: HSP201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nick is hands down one of the best professors I've had at DePaul. He gives really engaging lectures that are easy to understand. Quizzes are easy; he'll even give you the option to correct your mistakes for full credit, so there's no reason to not get 100%. Case studies are pretty easy too. TAKE THIS CLASS; you won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2013<br>Class Name: HSP201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nick is AMAZING!

THIS. MAN. He is a fantastic teacher and is always willing to help you out! I had to miss a class when there was a quiz so instead of giving me a 0 he let me write a summary of the topic. He'll go out of his way to answer questions and help you with anything from class material to your resume to finding a job or just figuring out your life.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2012<br>Class Name: HSP201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nick is fantastic. He's super passionate about the industry. The homework is absurdly easy and there is no final exam, but you still learn a lot. I've taken HSP 201 and 202 with him and I would highly recommend any class by Dr. Nick. He'll also bring breakfast for his early morning classes!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2012<br>Class Name: HSP201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT professor.

He usually always lets us out early, is an easy grader, easy assignments and sometimes brings bagels and coffee from dunkin donuts!  whats not to like?</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2012<br>Class Name: HSP202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nick is great! One of my favorite teachers I have had at DePaul. The class is very easy, no exams. You have 4 lectures and the rest are field trips. My class visited the university club and the park hyatt on michigan. Fun class and great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2012<br>Class Name: HSP201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nick is a great professor. He does take a point off for missing class but the quizzes and case studies are very easy. If I didn't miss a class I would be getting a 100%. He does let you correct any wrong quiz questions. Need to read the assigned book to do book analysis. Book is an easy read but would not suggest procrastinating on reading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2012<br>Class Name: HSP202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class, awesome professor! One day you spend on lecture the other day is spent on a field trip going to different hospitality establishments in the city. No tests, just a few assignments and one small, very easy, paper. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2012<br>Class Name: HSP201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor! Easy and interesting class in which you will actually use the information in the real world. No tests, just a few simple assignments. Lectures are interesting and engaging. Professor is considerate of student needs and times and treats us as equals instead of "beneath" him like some professors do. Highly reccommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: HSP201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best professors. He is knowledgeable, informative, and fun. He has a great sense of humor. He is also caring of our midterm/final restrictions so he will assign projects at the beginning of the term.
