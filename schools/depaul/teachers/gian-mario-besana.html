He made things clear to understand and his lectures were informative and interesting. He provides timely feedback and is willing to look over your code. Awesome class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2014<br>Class Name: CSC401<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved him! He does a great job explaining topics in layman's terms -- his lectures are interactive and informative.  He is also super funny.  The homework assignments will push you, but aren't unreasonable, and he is always willing to point you in the right direction if you show him your code.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2007<br>Class Name: GPH259<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not helpful, shows powerpoint slides all class and works in groups but not very useful and is strict on neatness of hw/ will take points off for smudges.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2007<br>Class Name: GPH259<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>class is semi-interesting and fun, but the homework is tedious, the projects are difficult and the directions for them suck, and he grades really hard on tests. this class will keep you extremely busy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2007<br>Class Name: GPH259<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor but anal about neatness/work! Easy material but not an easy A. Quizzes every week which arnt hard; lab projects every 3 weeks; Midterm and Final, which is cumulative. If you have the time for this class, I would recommend it; however, if you have a tight schedule and need a lab class, this might not be the best choice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the bomb!!  Very interested in his class and his students.  He really wants the students to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2007<br>Class Name: GPH250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor is nice but do not take this class if you have alot of other course work. There are quizzes every monday, time consuming assigments due wendsday and labs due every 3 weeks. Very anal about neatness- so again, if you will be in a hurry to get work done, DONT take this class. Not very easy. But nice guy&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2006<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor.  Very interested in the subject matter and very informative.  But his class will not be a cakewalk!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2006<br>Class Name: ISP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great guy, personable and always willing to help.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was great!!! I am not a CTI major or anything close to that and I pretty much understood the class well because he was very clear and patient.  He truly helps his students understand the material because it can get confusing.  Be ready to spend A LOT of time on his homework...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2006<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Class, fun professor.  At first he may come off as cocky..well,come to think of it, he actually is kinda cocky. But he definitely knows what he's teaching, and makes the class as enjoyable as he can.  PLUS, he's kind of nice to look at.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: CSGPH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Very helpful, clear, nice powerpoints. give extra credit, lots of work though, but worth it. Good professor ever at Depaul. One thing is, he could remember everyone's name in class within 2 weeks. Awesome professor! also, he will never give up some lower grade students. he will keep you up.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: GPH259<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the first time Prof.Besana taught GPH259.  His lectures were very good, and he explained everything very well. However, the homework took an EXTREEMLY long time.  Be ready to spend 2-3 hours on homeworks and 5-6 hours on projects.  Then again, this is a lab class.  Good teacher, but lots of homework.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>explore-digital divide. boring subject but Besana is fu*** awesome!! very well prepared and careful at detail. very helpful in and out of class. the class had that weird bonding thing, i still talk to people from it. class subject is a bit lame, but besana is just an overall awesome guy. my fav prof</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIM! He sucks at teaching Java on an intermediate level. His howework assignments are very hard, and he doesnt explain all the material needed to get the homework done properly. Only 4 people passed his class out of 25 enrolled, so go figure. HE SUCKS!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome! Explains things well so that you will understand. Don't listen to the post that says you will fail if you didn't take IT130. I never took an IT course in my life and I got an A in the class! You just need to enter the class with the sincere willingness to learn and study.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great instructor.  He is very clear and you will learn a lot! Great choices for assignments and programming projects. Lectures are interesting/intense. I guarantee you won’t fall asleep! Please don’t take this class if you are not a CS student, or if you haven’t taken IT 130.  YOU WILL FAIL!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Must Take w/ Him! if you do all the work, you won't get wrong!! He is a good professor, explain things well, willing to help! Easy Grader! Fair Midterm and Final. To be honest, every java class has a lot of work. His hw were not that long! Most were short program.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Besana is one of the best professors I've ever had! Explains the material in a very clear manner. Always available to answer questions and is very helpful. Grading is very fair. I highly recommend taking a course from him! Hopefully I'll be able to take a future course taught by him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2005<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Besana is one of the best teachers at DePaul. He makes sure everyone knows what they are doing n is funny at the same time.  He is also very good on the eyes.  And he has a HOT accent to go along with it.  Definitely take a class taught by him!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2004<br>Class Name: CSC211212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrific teacher.  He knows how to explain everything very effectively.  If you really care about your grade, then there is no way for you to come to class, pay attention, do the homework, and not get a B in his class.  He is the best teacher I had at DePaul.  I highly recommend him to everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2004<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>excellent teacher, good at what he does. makes sure everyone is on the same page at all times. i would highly recommend this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2004<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very good professor.
