I didn't know how interested I would be in Latin, since I had never taken it.  But Penny makes a very difficult subject easy and fun.  She's got a caretaker quality to her.  She's very kind, generous, and attentive.  She is always available to give outside help.  And she's just a really smart, fun person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: LAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Livermore is outstanding!  She takes the time to really learn about her students and their interests in antiquity.  Dr. Livermore is a person who loves the Classics - not just a professor who spouts out the facts. She is a fair grader.  I'm looking forward to taking many more courses with her. One of my best professors in all my years.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2009<br>Class Name: LAT103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This amazing woman will touch your life, if you have the opportunity she is a must-take.

You don't necessarily need to do the readings- she gives out summaries of the plays. There are three tests, and a fun final project.
