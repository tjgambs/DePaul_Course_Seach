On the one hand, I learned a lot about so many great philosophers and his passion for philosophy is infectious. On the other, it seemed like he related everything back to Marxism and he is terrifying when he gets angry at the world (not at students). The reading material was dense, but he is willing to meet with you. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2014<br>Class Name: PHY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Joseph is the best professor i have ever met. lecture well, he is helpful. And he works towards the success of his students. I was scared of the course but to my greatest surprise i got an A. I recommend him for this course. Joseph you are the best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2014<br>Class Name: BUSINESSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>An amazing professor who actually cared about his students and listened to them. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2014<br>Class Name: PHL245<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class as an elective and felt overwhelmed the first couple of days. If you go to class and take notes you will get an A. I showed up to about 75 of class and got an A no problem. Impossible to be bored in this class and I hate Politics. Easily most interesting class I''ve ever taken. Love this guy and will take whenever available. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: PHL240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe is an amazing professor who is very passionate about philosophy and spreading the idea that it's okay to think differently than someone else.  Class was fun and engaging, and you can get away with doing little to no work...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2014<br>Class Name: PHIL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is awesome, one of the best teachers I've ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2014<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! Readings can be difficult but he clarifies them during class. Does not ask for much except that you understand the material and attempt to apply it to your daily lives. He is really cool and wants people to speak up for what they believe! MUST TAKE! And he is lenient as long as you are willing to put effort :]</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy knows his stuff and will even go out of the way to help you out. By far one of the best professors I have taken at DePaul. He is really excited for each class and makes the whole class involved in conversation, which I found really helpful in understanding the subject really well. Do recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2013<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST TEACHER EVER. He is SO nice and funny, you will never be bored in class. He is crazy in a good way! He wants his students to "break away" from the way school is so the class can change/alter the midterm and final!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2013<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most inspiring professors I've ever had. He was so passionate about the readings, he would yell at us if it got us to pay attention and talk. He wants your opinions so give them to him. Two papers that I wish I had been able to spend more time on, but no quizzes or "busy" work just fascinating readings. Take this mans class! Oh and hot..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2013<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe is an amazing professor. He has enlightened me SO much; I see the world much different than I ever have before. I vow to keep taking his classes as much as I can. Although the material is rather difficult, he is a very understanding grader and will do anything he can to help you to understand. His passion is addicting and contagious. Best ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: LSPREVOLUTION<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was not a seminar but still a very good class.  Changed the way I look at the world.  Extremely passionate, he will yell/scream to get you to understand the point of view he's trying to convey.  Truly says some real things worth learning.  Initially didn't like him but now I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures make an early class bearable. He is entertaining and the entire class felt like sitting at local pub with a friend who has a passion for philosophy...he makes topics easy to relate to and rekindled a want to analyze and question what I read.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are intense, but he made me laugh.I didn't understand half the stuff he said. The class wasn't really about buisness ethics either. I wouldn't take him if you have never read philosophical writing before. He seems like a cool guy, but sort of intimidating.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe is a cool guy but he is realllly into philosophy. I don't understand half of the stuff he says and the class isn't really aboutr business ethics. It is about the flaws of capitalism. No textbook, but LOTS of confusing readings. sometimes quizzes! Joe is cool but the class sucks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't let the ratings fool you--Joe is the best philosophy prof at DePaul. He is passionate about philosophy, and expects his students to think critically about their own lives. His class should not be taken passively. You will get out what you put in, and Joe will help you critique your ideas if you SPEAK UP.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: PHILO100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Weiss is by far the best teacher I have taken thus far. He is very passionate about what he does. Joe is very understanding and considerate. As long as you do the work and become involved during class you'll do great. I recommend Prof Weiss to anyone who wants to get their money's worth.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2011<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe Weiss is my favorite teacher so far at DePaul.  He is awesome.  MGT/PHI 248 is fairly easy with him, lots of reading though that is required because he'll have some pop quizzes once in a while.  3 major papers, not too bad, just follow his directions exactly.  He gives the best lectures and is HILARIOUS. TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2010<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man has an enormously philosophical mind.  He doesn't &quot;favor Communism&quot;, he's simply a staunch critic of capitalism, and he's very eloquent in doing so.  His passion is endearing and his deadpan humor is hilarious.  One of the best profs I've ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2010<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good guy, but lectures can be pretty boring. He stopes taking attendance after the first few classes; midterm paper, final group paper and project.  Overall not a hard class but pretty dull.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really gets into his philosophy. Sometimes the lectures were a bit dry. Seemed like he picked favorites with a couple of students. Readings, midterm essay, one group project worth a lot, but he gives you the whole quarter to do it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a great professor! He got a lot of passion to the subject he teaches. Easy to get an A if you read the text and think about it... take him if you can great experience</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe is an amazing teacher! He's really passionate about the subject, and he sometimes gets really into what he's teaching, it's kinda cute.  We had only one quiz, and the midterm and final were a little tricky.  If you take notes and don't miss a single class, you'll get an A.  Taking good notes really helped me with the essays.  Take this class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2008<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe is freaking awesome. He is well educated and extremely helpful. Those who fail or do poorly are those who DO NOT read the texts. This class is not difficult, and Joe makes it as interesting as possible. There were two 5-7pg papers. He's so down to earth and HOT! The best PHL teachers are Weiss and Artis, so if you can, choose one of them!  Luck</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2008<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, he isn't horrible.  I agree, he definitely enjoys what he is talking about.  However, sometimes I really don't think he knew WHAT he was talking about.  Really no homework except for reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really good teacher, he really enjoys what hes talking about, and it makes for a very interesting class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2008<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No homework. One mid-term essay. Final is a group presentation. Not that difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2007<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Teacher!  He is very new and is still a graduate student but that just allows him to relate to the students more.  He grades easy and is an awesome guy.  You will learn a lot and get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His inexperience with teaching really begins to show when you get in depth with some material. Not the best at explaining or giving examples. Paper grading was easy. He gets a little too animated, and can easily let the discussion get off topic. The texts he uses are really hard if you have no philosophy background.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2007<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good guy,  but you can tell he has not been teaching long, he often wanders off topic. when on topic he uses the same example over and over. for a philosophy teacher he could stand to be much clearer</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tends to take himself a little too seriously. Attacks people for having opinions, thereby involuntarily discouraging student participation. Despite the theatrical performaces, it is evident that he puts himself on a high pedestal. Considers himself somehow &quot;enlightened&quot; . . . but then again, don't we ALL&#63;&#63; ;)) Nice he may be; inspiring he is not.</div></div></div></body></html>
