There was a class where she spent at least half an hour with students at the front of the class passing a piece of paper between each other, to show the purpose of conso elims. This was a graduate course. She did not teach the pertinent concepts, but did this...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2013<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tends to get things wrong. Goes very very slow and goes over the easy things too many times and skims over hard things. Very textbook not many real experiences. Also does not give enough time for tests/quizzes. and it is not like the homework -- avoid but other 308 teachers aren't much better.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2013<br>Class Name: ACC545<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is definitely the worst experience at DePaul. The final exam drove me crazy, it was nothing like what was expected. The only thing she was doing at class is reading the slides and showing off her Excel skills. I had to sacrifice my weekends to teach myself at home! BTW,the homework is tough and useless.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2012<br>Class Name: ACC545<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my worst experiences at DePaul.  The final exam was nothing like what was expected.  All of her lectures were very hard to follow and unclear.  All she did was read of the power point's provided for her.  I Had to teach myself the material which made me feel cheated of the education I thought I was paying for.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2012<br>Class Name: ACCT902<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Szalkus, while she was demanding, she was able to keep  my interest level high in a difficult subject. She was very fair in her grading. Very approachable and knowledgable. Available for questions when needed. Real world experience to draw from.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2012<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice professor, but really hard to follow. Her midterm was NOTHING like what she said it would be. She rushed through all the material. Even though she was nice and willing to help, unless you want to teach your self EVERYTHING I would not recommend her. By far one of the worst experiences I have had at DePaul.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
