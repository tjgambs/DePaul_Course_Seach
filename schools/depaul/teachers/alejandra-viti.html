She is such a sweet lady! Easy grader and is very understanding. Makes learning Spanish very easy! I am blessed to have her as my instructor. HIGHLY recommended!! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2015<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Senora Viti understands that DePaul's hybrid language learning model is not without flaws and works hard to clear up confusion.  She grades easier than my current professor, but I think that she understands this is a second language on top of many other commitments for students.  So sweet, honestly a great woman.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Senora Viti really cares about her students. She wants you to learn Spanish, and is very friendly about doing so. She allows for questions in English and well take the time to make sure you understand anything you may not. Take her and you won't be disappointed. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: SPN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! I took a conversation class with her and all she really looks for is participation- doesn't matter if you're speaking 100% correctly. This is how a language class should be: no pressure to be perfect, but gets you talking. You discuss films and readings which for the most part are interesting. Good grade if she sees you're trying.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very friendly professor! I hate Spanish but she is very friendly and understanding with people's Spanish. If you're serious about Spanish I wouldn't recommend taking her but if you just need to fulfill your language requirement I would definitely recommend Viti!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2013<br>Class Name: SPN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly recommend this professor.

We got along extremely well. She is super sweet, funny, and helpful! So thankful I took her..I wish she could permanently be my Spanish professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: SPANISH103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite teachers ever, she is great. I had to take spanish my last three quarters at DePaul and she really helped me understand, and learn the langauge.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: SPN206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't say enough good things about Ale. She's an amazing teacher, and is very sweet and relaxed. She's very understanding of that you have a life outside of her class. She recognises the potential in her students and encourages/pushes them to do well. Class was always a pleasure. She made sure we got our work done and had fun while we were at it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down best spanish teacher at DePaul, she is so friendly and makes class enjoyable. Is pretty easy so if you are not skilled in spanish or taking it merely as a requirement, take Viti. She will be worth it in the end!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2012<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very helpful and knowledgable in what she teaches you. She understands how it can be alot to learn in two class periods so she does help you if she sees you made a mistake on a test. She is funny and the class overall is not bad. Take her if you can !</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2011<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests can be a bit tricky, but if you aren't sure about something she will help you during the test. She gave extra credit. For the most part she explained things clearly. If you ever need help she will help. Of the 3 SPN profs I had, the oral exam here was the easiest. Take her if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2011<br>Class Name: SPN205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's great! very understanding and helpful! we correct homework in class, so you can always get help, I highly recommend her!-spn heritage speakers</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: SPN115<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class consists of 6 workbook chapters with various assignments and a quiz for each chapter. There are two group presentations, one of which is the final. The professor accepts late work willingly and is always ready to help. Missing a few classes is allowed as long as you e-mail her beforehand. Also be ready to participate during class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: SPN206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!

Very funny and laid back. Hard grader on essay, but she gives you a chance to fix it. Tests are kind of easy: she'll define words for you if you don't know them, gives you hints if she thinks it's a hard test, some extra credit, and won't ask unfair questions. Highly recommend taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2009<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best Spanish professors I have taken at DePaul.
