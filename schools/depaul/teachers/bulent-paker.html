His tests are a little difficult, as he does not collect h.w. or assign problems.  But he has a HUGE curve.  A B ended up being a 67 in our class.  I got a 96 in the class, but I love finance.  Good teacher!  Recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2007<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best finance professor I've had.  He is patient and takes time to help his students learn the material.  He is also very knowledgeable, intelligent, and very logical.  His material is interesting too. Wish he taught more classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2007<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best prof at Depaul. He makes you study and learn not memorize and just pass the class. Just take a good notes then you will be fine...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2007<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Paker is a great Professor.  He takes the time to go through all the problems that you need to know for quizes, midterm, and final.  All these three of these are hard but the class is curved to a &quot;B&quot; (what ever the class average).  Take this professor. You'll learn alot!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2007<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best FIN teacher i ever had at depaul...... just do the homework and take good class notes... you will get an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best Depaul finance professor's I have come across.  If you show up to class and take good notes then you should not have any problem getting at least a B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very pleasant professor. He writes out every problem on the chalkboard so you can relate more to your notes. HIS BIGGEST PRO IS THAT HE ALWAYS CURVES THE QUIZZES AND TESTS TO A &quot;B.&quot; No matter what. THis places more emphasis on actually learning rather than memorizing for the sake of a grade. A+ PROF</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the best Finance professor at DePaul, and just in general my favorite professor. He is a very good teacher, knows how to explain topics in detail, very organized, and a nice person in general. He does care about the students a lot, and ask for help. If you have a choice for 330, take him! Do your homework and you'll do good on the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Go to class! He is a good professor.  Explains everything in detail and is there if you ever need help. Only grades are midterm and final and you need to buy the book.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
