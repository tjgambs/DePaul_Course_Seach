Very thorough being clear and concise with what's is expected. Learning Objectives ensured you knew what was expected of you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2013<br>Class Name: PSY343<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful in explaining everything until you understand and are able to apply it. The material itself is dry and pretty boring (psych measurement) but he really tries to include videos, examples, and practice problems to explain. The tests are direct and he gives a study guide every class that sets up the exam. Really great guy altogether!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2012<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very helpful! When I didn't understand things, he was willing to help. He explains things very clearly and wants you to learn. It's a research class so it's not the best, but we had a paper we worked on the whole quarter, midterm, final, a couple very small hmwk assignments nd a few EASY quizzes (if you were on the right track, you got a 100)</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
