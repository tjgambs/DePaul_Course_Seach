Instead of spending class time showing examples of problems that will be for homework and on quizzez, he copies down crappy notes with zero enthusiasm and makes up shi*ty examples that will never appear on any Test or Quiz. The Text Book does a better job of teaching the material don't waste time listening to Mikhail just read the text</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: MTH262<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lecture format approach an equivalence of a vocalized catatonic zombie trance by merit of the format.  No enthusiasm is exhibited at all.    Don't take at night, you will fall asleep.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
