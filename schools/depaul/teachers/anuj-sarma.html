He always asks for more participation from students&then when students ask questions he attacks them&makes them feel stupid for even opening their mouth. Assigned an unnessesarytedious group project (w presentation&paper) . DOES NOT ACCEPT LATE WORK. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2014<br>Class Name: 170<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wastes class time by doing WORTHLESS labs instead of practicing material. When it comes to the "quizes"(these are tests...) they're unreasonably difficult and the homework doesn't prepare you for them.  It's material that goes past what you've seen in class or hw. A professor who makes the course overly hard and acts like its your only course. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2013<br>Class Name: PHY205<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Eh. He can be really frustrating because he's unclear in lectures, but his lecture notes online are pretty clear. He'll snap at you if you're talking during class or catch him a bad time, but besides that he's pretty nice. I hear he's a LOT better than any other physics prof though. (I wouldn't know, I'm just taking this as an elective)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very helpful and has a good sense of humor. Most of the material was pretty easy, but he is a very tough grader, and takes off points for everything. Its very hard to get 100% on the homeworks because he always find a bunch of little things wrong.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: PHY171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sarma is quite frankly, the sh*t.  One of the most entertaining professors i have had, and very clear with his explanations and examples.  Anyone who likes physics will love him.  The tests could be difficult, but there was never anything that we didn't learn or go over on them.  Great class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2012<br>Class Name: PHY171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>prepare to sweat bullets during his tests. you'll study study study and you still won't get that 100%. i dont think anyone has ever gotten a 100% on any of his tests unless they're richard feynman or something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2011<br>Class Name: PHY171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor of the 170 sequence, available for help, willing to go above and beyond for his students.  Clear lecturer, tests are difficult, but remember, HE WILL HELP YOU, just go in to see him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2011<br>Class Name: PHY171<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Sarma provides lecture notes for students and is always available for help.  He made his lectures interesting by implementing humor and pop culture.  Definitely take a class from Sarma while you're at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2010<br>Class Name: LP115<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a G.

Sarma is the man.  No question about it, son.  If you like Physics, you'll love having him as a teacher.  If you don't, you'll still probably love it.  So yeah, why don't you go ahead and register for that class.  Chop chop.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty fun and interesting &quot;Galileo vs. The Church&quot; class. There is a bunch of writing (1pg due every class) but then when it comes time for the 2 big papers, and final paper, you basically already have them written. He is REALLY smart, and is easy to get off track. You can ask him almost anything and he will answer it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take Chicago in Sound with this man. After Immersion week the class is mostly a waste of time. Nothing is learned and the papers that you're forced to write are nothing but a regurgitation of his notes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do NOT take Discover:Chicago Sound with this man! Yeah, immersion week was fun. But after that, it's a crap class. He isn't clear in his intentions; all you do is physics, no Chicago; essays must be regurgitations of his notes; he's very biased with his favorites; he grades based on your personality; he looks above your head when he lectures, weird</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: PHY170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher, very nice, and very helpful.  Class was really easy (mechanics and whatnot).  He's hilarious and makes lecture enjoyable.  Not that you will have a choice if you're taking a physics class, but I definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: PHY170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously, he is the best professor. Ever. :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: PHY204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So helpful, so nice, uses pop culture in powerpoints to jazz up lectures. The beginning of the class was a lot of fun but towards the end he tried to jam in as much as he could. Quizes/hw every other week. Midterm and Final were kinda intense but hes so great its worth it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: PHY204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An excellent Professor. The material is not very difficult and he is more than willing to give extra help to anyone. His lectures are very thorough (even funny at times) and he posts everything online. Highly recommended, especially if looking to fulfill an SI requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: PHY171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was pretty difficult, but Sarma is a great guy.  He is very friendly, and funny; he makes me want to go to class everyday for a subject I hate.  Very helpful and accessible outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2007<br>Class Name: PHY204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sarma is an extremely fair, intelligent, and time worthy professor. Class was very interesting and not very difficult. I learned a lot and didn't have to stress over a grade. Class was 25% quizes, 20% homework, 25% midterm, and 30% final. Would definitely take again, highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2007<br>Class Name: PHY171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good guy, moderately easy...some studying is required but not too bad. Should be easy for most kids who know calculus.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: PHY171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's a great guy and very helpful if you have any questions of if you just want to chat about anything...i highly suggest to take him...at first his accent is hard to understand but you can get used to it...he is very organized and loves to do in class experiments which are very fun...i would recommend showing up everyday in order to get an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Generally a nice guy. Take into consideration my ratings reflect his teaching ISP103.. a easy freshman discover class.. i hate physics, but this wasn't bad at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>1st, I dont like science, this was required, 2nd I was amazed!  Sarma is an outstanding teacher, he is fair, funny, extremely smart, highly accessible, and overall one of the best teachers I have ever had!  I actually looked forward to this class, and I learned a lot.  The work load is fair, and his pace is nice; highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2005<br>Class Name: PHY301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>knows his stuff, but gets can very agitated when you ask questions.  he does not make students comfortable asking for help, does not understand humor and takes the lack of respectfullness in american culture personally. he really holds a grudge and is incompetent in MATLAB. unfortunately, i am force to take more classes with him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: 200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgable but poor at getting his point across sometimes. Goes off on tangents about things beyond the 200 coarse and then tells us to forget about it. Can be funny, just read the book, review, review, review, and you will do well. Plus the curve is huge.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2004<br>Class Name: AST<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>IF YOU PAY ATTENTION U SHOULD DO WELL TESTS RE HARD BUT IF YOU STUDY YOU'LL DO FINE FUNNY TEACHER</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very thorough teacher & knows the subject very well.  Expect to study pretty hard for tests, but if you do, you should do well on them.  His open door office hours policy is great.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
