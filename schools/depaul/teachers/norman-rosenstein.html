His class is heavily weighted on quantmath online homework assignments which were never taught in the two hours of story time he gave us each class. He is unorganized and gives low grades,DROP</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2014<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Norman Rosenstein...where do I begin? He made us purchase an online Aplia access code which costs $115.00 . Then he assigns massive amounts of online hw through Aplia, none of which correlates with the stuff he talks about in class. Classtime is devoted to very basic info and storytime while hw is advanced. Don't Take Him. He's unorganized and slow</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2014<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>i don't understand how anyone could give him a grade other than awesome. i love this guy! his class is super easy and i rarely ever even showed up. as long as you keep up with the assignments and keep in contact with him and show up for quizzes and stuff, you are sure to get an A or a B depending on your interest in the course. id HIGHLY recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2014<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His expectations are clear on how the course will be structured. The topics requires understanding of basic algebra but nothing that hard. The exams were graded fairly and it was a very fun course to take. He will present challenging problems but nothing outside the slides.You don't need the book just focus on his slides.Good course+instructor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Norm is very intelligent and helps make comparisons between the topics covered and the professions of the students.  He lets you bring a cheat sheet for the exams.  He's a fairly lenient grader.  The group project takes a few weeks to do, start early on it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2014<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Rips slides from other universities. Doesn't teach, just reads slides and brags about his own business. Would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2013<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He offers a great perspective on the class with his background. He makes the class participate by constantly asking questions during lectures. You really need to fully understand all concepts because his tests are a bit tricky (especially the final). He's extremely helpful and enthusiastic, which always makes for a great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2013<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'd never taken Econ. The professor was great. He was good at explaining both quantitative and strategic-thinking topics. He used great examples. His lectures covered everything that we needed to know, so some people saw that as a reason to not read the textbook. Because of that, some of them struggled with easy topics. A few people BOMBED on exams</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, very smart, not always clear - examples/homework/group project guidelines.  Homework uses in-class examples with twists to make them harder-he'll give help if you ask. 2 easy midterms, 1 harder/cumulative final - you get to use notes.  Attend class and do the work and you'll be OK. Start the group project early - it's time consuming.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2013<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The instructor ALWAYS was easy to get a hold of & highly helpful. He really cares and focuses on students grasping course topics. He also was very flexible and understanding. He allowed me to attend other lectures of his if I had to miss the scheduled class time. I really enjoyed my time in his class! I also never opened the textbook and did fine</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Norm, is a great professor. I highly recommend him. Read the book and pay attention to the notes and the lecture and you'll get an A. The best part is that he teaches how to do the work with Minitab, which makes the class easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2012<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers I have ever had.

Really nice and funny guy too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2012<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best profs.

Goes extremely fast.  Relies completely on his own slides and notes, no textbook use at all, even though purchased.  Yes, you can bring in a sheet for help, but the tests are really difficult.  He likes to test you on material you touched on, but did not apply during class.  Had perfect A's until now...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2012<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, unorganized teaching, useless textbook, faulty notes</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2011<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher.Willing to explain your confusion.Easy to connect. The exams are fair, not too easy,not too hard.He has long time work experience.I would love to take his course again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teacher in DePaul University!!! He teaches clearly and you can feel that he really wants you to learn practical things. And bring cheat sheet to the exam helps really a lot. Choose him and no regret!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2010<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor, he really takes an interest in his students and you can tell he really wants you to pass his class.  Obviously the material isn't exactly easy but he lets you bring in one cheat sheet to exam.  I don't care much for Economics but if I had to take another Econ class I would make sure he was teaching it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2010<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far one of the best teachers at DePaul.  He really takes an interest in you if you show some kind of effort.  I would highly recommend Norm.  The class wasn't easy but he'll make as understandable as possible.  The fact that he lets you bring a cheat sheet in to the exam really helps.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, will recommend him for any ECO class. Micro is not an easy subject, but the fact that he teaches it, makes it a lot easier. You are allowed one formula sheet on each exam. 3 exams, 6 home works, rare MC and a regression project. Textbook is not really used, mostly his power points. Spends time outside of class vie email/phone etc</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2010<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is great.  Tons of real world experience.  He really can back up his talk because he has walked the walk for many years.  It can be a challenging class, but most Econ classes are.  Prof. Rosenstein does all he can to help and all the powerpoints are on bb if need to brush up on class material. One of my favorite teachers at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Must have patience to get through his class! Just accept that slides for most classes will have errors. He is quite knowledgeable, but not effective in transfering/sharing that info. He shares problem solutions (after turned in) and allows notes for tests, but its a lot of work, and you have to figure out quite a bit on your own. Don't recommend hi</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor really wants you to do well and is very helpful.  If it's been a while since you did math, review the business calculus book before the first class.  Material updated on Blackboard the day before or the day of class - no time to pre-review.    Explained at a basic level and then jumped way ahead - sometimes errors in material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2009<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He would do anything to you know just to get a good grade. Emails you back as soon as he can. Explains at his best, he tests you on your critical thinking instead of memorizing the context. If you are an Econ major, I really recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2009<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have an interest in Econ, I would suggest taking him. He teaches at a fast pace and expects students to absorb all the information in one session, as he is teaching. Overall, I hated his teach style and he did not know how to explain problems. Homework-Aplia- is all online, midterm and final was not all that easy. go for a 4.0+ prof. instead</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor made a three hour night class so much more bearable. he goes above and beyond to help his students learn. for tests, be sure to study his powerpoints! his way of explaining things tended to make more sense than the book.. online homework due every wk. microeconomics as a whole was difficult for me, but w/ this prof, it's not too bad</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would prefer to learn everything in life from this man!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not as bad as this makes it look. Attendance is not mandatory and he helps whenever you need it. Easy online homework do once a week, but it's not bad. Clearly knowledgeable about the subject but boring at times. He's a nice guy I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am a freshman without much college experience.  With that said, he is by far my favorite teacher right now.  Some might find it to be a confusing subject, however Mr. Rosenstein will make sure you know it.  Uses real life business points as well as college humor.  Great teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Very smart! The material is difficult but if you attend class, pay attention, and make the effort to learn you'll do great. It is fast paced, but professor Rosenstein makes sure everyone understands the material. Didn't think the project should have been included in the summer session - not enough time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Like the other posters said, Norm tends to be very disorganized when it comes to class notes,  There are always a ton of misspellings and incorrect answers.  Other than that, he was ok, not great but not awful.  Gave out a lot of point for showing your work on exams.  He is also a verry fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2008<br>Class Name: DFSDSDFS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hey students of Norman Rosenstein! This is his daughter    Eliza Rosenstein. look im aware of the typos and his random tangents but thats how my dad is. give him a break he just had a liver transplant. and before the operation he was pretty sick and couldn't exactly think straight. give him a break. he's coming back better then ever.

His notes often had misspellings.  It would have been helpful if he would have reviewed his work.  He grades easily and is always willing to help.  His intentions are good, but his delivery is confusing.  I would not purchase the books.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2007<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is still trying to figure things out.  He can't present worth a damn, and his entire course is based out of this presentation notes.  Don't bother wasting your money on the textbook.   He does curve and tries to help you pass his class, but I would have rather taken a different teacher.  Enjoy this math class disguised as an economics class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2006<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smart guy.  Easy grader.  Curve is crazy.  Take him if you want to learn.  He's not as confusing as the others say he is.

However, he is new professor and is still working on structuring the class.

He may understand the subject, but has NO skills transferring that knowledge to his students.  Completely unavailable outside of class.
