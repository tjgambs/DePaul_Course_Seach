He makes bio more interesting than i thought--if you show up and put in some effort into reviweing before tests you will do well in this class, even if you suck at bio like i do :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2008<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy & funny sometimes. Must go to labs, but lectures you don't. Lectures are SO boring; i had 8:30, so that didn't help. Labs are EASY, but tests are hard. 3 quizzes straight from book, 3 tests, 7 labs. PP pres. are on BB, so don't need to go to lectures. Study for tests and you'll do fine, but if you don't like science, it wil be tough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2008<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He made the course interesting which can be difficult for people. Book is needed for quizzes but questions come straight from the book. Lectures alot from powerpoints, so print them out- helpful later on for midterm. Overall nice guy, probably the best to take this required course with!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2007<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easygoing and enthusiastic.  Lectures aren't mandatory and he doesn't mind people drifting in and out of them if they're long.  He posts them all on blackboard, and are basically straight from the book.  Labs are required and there are no makeups, but they are easy and fun, so you won't mind going anyway. Made my 1 required lab worth taking.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2007<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor and class! He is very cool and if you give 100% he will be very fair in grading you. Pretty laid back Professor, but you will learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2007<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really a nice guy. It is an okay class. 2 exams and a final. Some quizes throughout the quarter. Lectures a little too much and can get frusturating at times because isn't easiest material to learn. Be prepared to have to put some effort into this class. He is understanding with grades and does curve at end of quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2007<br>Class Name: BIO239<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very interesting class. you must study hard to get a good grade. he's a nice guy and makes the class interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
