Budde's lectures. He is very knowledgeable and I learned so many knew perspectives.  His dry sense of humor made me smile numerous times. There is about 45-60 pages of reading assigned for each class, but some of the books are interesting; only one of the books we read from was painfully boring</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2012<br>Class Name: CTH209<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>CLASS was hard. He leaves it up to the students to explain the readings of which there are a lot. So if you do not do the readings or go to class you will fail. Lectures a lot so take notes. Too much reading and difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2011<br>Class Name: PSC339<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class and Dr. Budde. He is brilliant but has a way of making the material easier to understand. He taught in seminar format, which basically turned the class into a high level book club. He'll make you think and he'll make you work. I am SO GLAD I had a class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2011<br>Class Name: PSC339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Budde, is AWESOME! Yes, there is heavy reading and you do need to READ because it will be on the test. But he is very interesting and really makes you think about different issues. He also really cares about his students, a nice change of pace from other professors.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2010<br>Class Name: CTH209<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Budde did plenty of lecturing in this class so you have to make sure to take good notes. But he's what I liked most about this class. He's very knowledgeable and understandable. I remember not wanting to ever miss his class because I knew I was missing out on pearls of wisdom. :) He's a good prof that knows his stuff and cares about the students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: ISP203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Budde knew so much about the topic and would just spew information, but take time to tell us exactly what he meant and ask our opinions as well. Great teacher and a great class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: PSC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't get me wrong, I'm as much of a fan of old dirty burned out hippies as the next guy, but Mr. Budde SUCKS at teaching.  He sits on his desk and rambles about the **** that gets him pissed off, but really teaches nothing.  It sounds like his angst from '60s protesting hasn't worn off yet.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2005<br>Class Name: VARIOUS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had 4 classes with Mike Budde, and I never left any of them feeling like I was not a more informed person and clearer thinker than when the class began.  He challenged me on many things, and we didn't agree all the time, but he made me a more observant, more considered person, which is all I ask from a class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2005<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough going at first. He's kind of intimidating. Student-run classes get monotonous after a while. I think he lectured once. Research paper in pairs and one critique of student presentations on reading. Some reading was interesting. Just take the class, it's required anyway.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2005<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good prof, good class.  He can be hard, but it's worth it.  He really seems to care.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2005<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible class, horrible professor.  Very unclear about everything.  Very angry person. Very smart, but he has no clue how to teach a class, he just rambles on and on-- if you have no background information on the subject, you're screwed!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2005<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>can be difficlut..exams are hard especialy the final. over all he is ok.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSC339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher!

Comes across as laid back but beware he is NOT laid back when grading your work.  Expects a lot but teaches a lot.  Still has a liberal attitude!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>looooooots of reaings and moves way to fast</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2005<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Budde is a very intelligent man with very strong Political Views.Sometimes he gets excited about a topic and pours information out to you.If your are not interested in Poly or are lazy do not take this class.He totally changed my view of the &quot;international community&quot; and U.S.'s involvment.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  JUST READ THE MATERIAL! BEWARE! Class is based heavily on reading. He explains anything unclear until you get it, willing to help out, it's kinda hard to take notes because he moves on so quickly BUT he will eventually repeat important stuff. Great class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2005<br>Class Name: PCS140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>is easly angered..very unclear about material..all he does is talk and talk and talk and talk and its sometimes difficult to right notes down.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2005<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>teacher does not apply the in-class discussions witht the readings.  he is BOOORING..take class at own risk</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2005<br>Class Name: PSC345<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for Political Econ. and it was a difficult class, but he finds ways to get you excited and is willing to explain things to you until it makes sense.  The other post is completely correct; he takes an interest in you as a person and really wants you to do well in life and in class. Take Him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2004<br>Class Name: PSC339<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Topics in Christian Thought...
