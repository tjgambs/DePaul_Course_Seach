I learned so much and developed my love for teaching. She knows what she's talking about since she has taught in the high school before. I found her to be very helpful even meeting with me multiple times outside of class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2014<br>Class Name: SEC325<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Heavy textbook use but these books are amazing and make sure to buy not rent. Strategy logs are a drag but useful if you do them. Hansra is awesome, understanding, and a great resource. The work can be overwhelming but it's manageable, if you stay on top of it. Great class discussions and projects. Not a class to take if you have senioritis...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: TL525<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The literacy course is the best education course in the entire program. I found all assignments useful. They were sometimes challenging, but useful for teaching. I am now teaching and rely on what we learned in this course daily. Dr. Hansra has also been a great resource for me now that I am teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2013<br>Class Name: TL525<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Hansra's Literacy class was one of the best I've taken at DePaul. The books are extremely helpful. She asks to lesson plan in a different way but it has helped me to think about how my lesson plans are linked to standards. This was a meaningful class that I wished I had taken sooner in the program.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2013<br>Class Name: TL428<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the most helpful methods class I've taken so far.
