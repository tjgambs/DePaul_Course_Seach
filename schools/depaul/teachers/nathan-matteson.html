He grades fairly. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2015<br>Class Name: GD105101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>He helps students in the best way he can. Gives you help and ideas on how to improve your work. He is willing to give his honest opinion on topics. Also gives a positive atmosphere when going to class. I would take another class with him as a professor. Very easy to talk to as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: GD215<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>He's really funny and an overall cool dude, but as a professor he's really not that great. His guidelines are really confusing, and he barely gives you any feedback. Every class after week 3 is a work day, but he doesn't teach you anything. Overall did nothing to further my education. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2013<br>Class Name: GD215<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nate is a really cool down to earth guy who knows what he's doing. Class is laid back but I wouldn't say easy because I find web coding difficult.</div></div></div></body></html>
