If you are taking this class in the last semester DO NOT. This class required more work than my accounting class alone Her tests are difficult and she is never on top of the class. Her least of worry is you, shes more concerned about playing with her kids. Textbook is useless. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: BIO126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Made class fun. There are assignments that she gives enough time for in class, two exams throughout the class, and a cumulative final. For all of her tests she gives a study guide, study each point and you'll get an A on the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2015<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>I really like Dr. Soderstrom as a person. That said, she was a very boring teacher. Her lectures drag and she goes fast. However; you can get the powerpoints on D2L and be fine. Study hard. Lots of material to cover. She explains things better when she is one-on-one or in lab.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2014<br>Class Name: BIO126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Soderstrom is goofy and great and I enjoyed every session. Class isn't mandatory, but you'll be lost without the lectures! Two big tests and one cumulative final - use the study guide and you'll be fine. Honestly, don't get the textbook; you won't need it if you pay attention in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2014<br>Class Name: BIO126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div> I am a psych major and absolutely adored this class! It's a scientific inquiry credit with no lab and it is sooo interesting! Dr. Soderstrom is so kind and helpful! Super approachable and willing to help. Detailed study guides, she is hilarious, and super knowledgeable and interesting to listen to. Exams are easy if you prepare and class goes fast</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2014<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! Super goofy, and very willing to help students. Her midterm and final exam were very fair based on her review guides. I definitely recommend taking her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2012<br>Class Name: HON220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Soderstrom is the best! Super helpful, very friendly, and totally understands that not everyone likes science. Definitely recommend HON220 Bio of Emotion to any Honors student for fulfilling the lab science requirement. Lectures not required, but I recommend going and paying attention to the powerpoints, and you will do fine.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
