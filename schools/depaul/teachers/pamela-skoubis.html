There are times when she won't be clear on her lecture. Her test were kind of difficult. Make sure you review the book before the test and if you guys are confused on a question on a test, she'll help you understand it. Overall I would recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2011<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good teacher. wont let you make up labs though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2010<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so nice and tries really hard to help you understand. subject matter isn't thrilling stuff to begin with, so let's cut her some slack. gives extra credit opportunities and will bump your grade up if you're on the border. plus, she looks like tina fey! take skoubis.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2010<br>Class Name: BIO239<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Considering the fact that this class it's for nonmajors,she makes it extremely hard to understand. She talks about every cell in the brain,which is hard to understand for someone who has no background in bio.She expects you to memorize everything for the exam, which you'll forget as soon as you leave the exam. Her voice is so annoying.Dont take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2009<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are some professors that really know the subject matter they are dealing with and can convey concepts and ideas concisely.  Professor Skoubis is not one of those gifted individuals. Let?s just say pedagogy is not one of her strong points.  If you are taking BIO 206 to actually learn something, do not take her class, you will be extremely disa</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, easy grader, very helpful and speaks to you like an equal. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2008<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She didn't make animal diversity and animal physiology as fun or as engaging as I had hoped, but she's there to teach not to entertain, so she was just fine. Everything is on powerpoint and lecture covers a LOT of material, but the tests are surprisingly fair. She's timid and speaks softly and monotonously, but she is EXTREMELY nice and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED PROFESSOR SKOUBIS! SHE MADE EVERYTHING VERY SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND! SHE IS GREAT</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2008<br>Class Name: BIO239<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Skoubis is the best!  She's clear, consistent, understanding and always willing to help.  Her labs are a blast and really help you learn the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2007<br>Class Name: BIO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Skoubis is amazing!Yes the material is time consuming, but if you put in the effort and actually study you'll do fine. Cramming simply will not work in this class. Take her, she's amazing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was an awesome class!!! It was not an easy A but I deifnately learned a lot. It was worth rolling out of bed two days a week to go to the loop in the morning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her. Albeit, it was, by all means, not an easy class, she was extremely nice and helpful. I just wish there were more smaller assignments to help improve grades. This class covers a lot of material in a short period of time, so if you have hard classes or you work -- Avoid. The textbook will also make a big hole in your pocket.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2007<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't count on an easy A....if bio is not your thing this class is not for you.  She's soo monotone that most of the time half of the class is literally asleep.  All you do is take notes and there is a lot of matierial covered.  3 exams and 2 easy papers.  Don't underestimate her you have to STUDY for the exams to do well</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely awesome professor. Is a little quirky, but once you warm up to her sense of humor, she is hilarious. She's also great about taking time to answer any questions you might have.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2006<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class. Finally you get to learn something useful. Keep in mind, however, that you will have to read the book (and memorize a lot of terms). If you are overwhelmed with other classes and maybe even jobs, this class may not be for you. Three multiple choice tests, a short (3 page) paper, and a 1 page course reflection essay.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2006<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brilliant prof.  I'm a non bio major but she gives interesting info and is very effective.  As long as you study, you will get a great grade.  Show up for class and you might get extra points.  Approx 90% of test comes straight from PP, which is posted on BB; know that material and you'll do great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2006<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Science teacher i have had in college.  Lectures are entertaining and go by fast.  She knows what she is talking about and is willing to work with you if you have problems.  Easy labs but hard tests.  You MUST study for tests in order to do well on them.  She grades on a curve if needed.  All in all great teacher with a great personality.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she has no busniess being a teacher. she's really nice but you won't get much out of her class or her lectures. just go to teh labs and do them and u'll get full credit. her tests are hard though, use the CD that comes with the book to study and you will do good!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2006<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The labs are easy and there are 3 exams, which are not hard if you study. 2 reaction papers just do them and she'll give you full credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2006<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
