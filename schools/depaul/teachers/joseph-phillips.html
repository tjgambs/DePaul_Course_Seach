Athough it was a little hard to catch his "tempo" at the bigining, it get better when you are used of it. And he is a nice guy and willing to discuss with or negotiate. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2015<br>Class Name: CSC407<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Disappointed, he is a very confusing teacher. But it seems he enjoy teaching and think that he explain things clearly. Homework are very tough and way beyond the level of his lecture. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2015<br>Class Name: CSC407<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He speaks in spurts with a regular stutter; very hard to follow him. Tough grader. Lost a lot of points because code didn't compile.  His assignments are FAR more advanced than the basic code he hoops us through in class. I have lost 7 lbs this last month from overwork and stress and I got B+s and A-s in all  my other classes effortlessly.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2015<br>Class Name: CSC407<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an ok teacher, not very clear but its fine if you do some extra work on reading. Homework is hard but he didn't grade it harshly, so it fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2015<br>Class Name: CSC407<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice guy and not a tough grader. But honestly he is very confusing teacher, I could not follow him,. Every time he ask if we have any questions, e very body is in scilent. I believe it is because every body get lost. Also I don't like that he force us to talk in the class. Some people just don't like to speak and not talktive. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2015<br>Class Name: CSC407<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't think he explains things clearly. But I understand that this course itself is hard and very difficult to be taught. He is a nice guy but not good at teaching, and you need to do a lot of work your self. Good thing is that he isn't a tough grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2015<br>Class Name: CSC374<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Joe is a really nice and energetic guy. He knows how to keep students interested and engaged. The assignments and final were challenging, but fair. My only problem is that he goes at a fast pace and he takes 2 days to reply back to emails. But do not hesitate to ask him a question, he's really good at explaining things. Take his classes. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2015<br>Class Name: CSC374<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>If you get the chance, take Prof. Joe. One of the best instructors i've ever had. You will learn so much and he will make it fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2015<br>Class Name: CSC407<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Joe, as he likes to be called, is an outstanding educator who knows systems programming like the back of his hand.  He is committed to helping you learn the material.  I highly recommend him.  My knowledge and skill set has grown greatly do to his instruction.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2014<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Joe is an okay professor, my only major complaint is that his exams are incredibly difficult. The roughest grade in our class was a D. Thankfully he curves...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: CSC407<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Joe is a tough one. His lecture style rambles a bit, but colorful. He strives to  explain machine instruction and addressing in easy-to-understand language because he knows it's hard to get at first. He is also pretty funny, and not surprisingly, brilliant. Grades on a curve. My head exploded during the final, but I came out OK - good prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2014<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talks a lot, teaches little. He covered so little material in such a long period of time it was almost frustrating to attend his class. He's an easy A. If you actually want to learn something, look elsewhere.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2014<br>Class Name: CSC407<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is everything I wanted in a teacher.  He will make a fool of himself just to give you a better chance of retaining the material. Keeps class fun. Recognizes students pay him and his willingness to help reflects this. Has a flexible course structure that allows feedback from students.  Smart, cool, and helpful professor. My favorite so far.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: CSC403<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This is an easy A class. He doesn't goes into the details of anything, just giving you a main idea about the subject (which I didn't like). His assignments are relatively  easy, but unorganized. he's always late in E-mails replies and exam grades. Participation in his class is required though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: CSC403<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is an easy A class. However the professor doesn't go into details of the subject, just touching the surface. You'll not get that much new stuff in the material. His homeworks are unorganized, but easy you're writing little code in specific parts of the program and running it, just like that. What really got me upset is his late E-mails reply.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2013<br>Class Name: CSC374<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the third class I have taken with Prof Joe.  As others have said he is very energized and tries to keep the class lively.  I walked out with a decent grade which was clearly curved but never felt like I learned the material.  Good guy but very disorganized, much better prof for lower level classes.  Don't take him for 374.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am not a fan of his type of teaching. Similar to how other's have picked up on, he speaks in short quick bursts and it is difficult to follow him. His homework assignments are extremely disorganized although not too difficult. I do not care for "jokey" professors, asking the class to "vote" on point distribution for syllabus... Just tell us.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A zany professor who literally jumped from table to table. He was an absolute riot. He was very helpful for me and was very relaxed. Must know though that he gives points each time you participate and the total is 20points. if you are person you doesnt speak you will have a 0/20.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Joe is very funny, clever, and nice. His lectures are not your typical kind, he makes them very entertaining. The homework was straightforward and papers were graded fairly easy. I would recommend him if you're looking to take a course that's not too difficult, but with a decent workload.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a real character. His enthusiasm is so intense that he'll bounce between subjects within microseconds. He does expect you to talk though, since its a seminar class. The homework is easy (reading and questions to discuss) but sometimes he'll tell us the homework at like 9 pm the night before. And the papers are graded easily</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2012<br>Class Name: CSC374<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>"Prof" Joe is very brilliant and quite energetic and has quite the silly sense of humor. The material he went over, though, was extremely difficult. He's very helpful, though. Agree with others about his speaking cadence, though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2012<br>Class Name: CSC374<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is energetic and can be funny but that's where the good parts end. It takes him forever to grade assignments, he is not available via e-mail, he speaks too quickly and in bursts, and his homework assignments are disorganized and useless. He is easily the worst professor I've taken at DePaul. Disappointing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2012<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>"Prof" Joe is a great guy with a great personality.  He teaches (arguably) some of the most difficult concepts for Computer Science Majors to grasp.  He was available via email for me the two times I needed him.  The only critique I would give to his teaching style is he may fall prey to the "smart kid in class".  Letting a single student take over</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2012<br>Class Name: CSC374<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His teaching methods might work for others, but it didnt work for me. He's enthusiastic, which is great for paying attention.  However, he talks a little fast and in bursts, which made it hard for me to follow/understand. Takes way too long to grade hw and doesn't answer emails. I won't take him again if given a choice between him and another prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: CSC374<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>2010 reviews are the accurate reviews.  Dynamic personality covers up the lack of teaching.  Gives you assignments and walks you through them; gives exams that are way more difficult and obtuse with little guidance.  Does not give a lot of help via e-mail.  Unorganized and extremely hard to follow.  Moves fast in all directions.  374 was wasted :(</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2011<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Joe is funny, zany, and a great instructor to take for this extremely tedious and very uninteresting course. Philips made the class easy with a very nice curve. I was a C work student yet walked away with an A. Take this man and pay attention. He has a lot to offer.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: CSC309<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very funny professor.  genuinely cares about the subject matter.  didn't understand why he thought some code was more elegant than others.  took a long time for assignments to be graded.  Grades on a curve, but I don't know the curve.  would've been better if I'd had more programming experience.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2010<br>Class Name: CSC374<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Joe is probably one of the best professors I've had at DePaul. He is very passionate about the subject matter and he engages his students. His tests are tough but he grades fairly. He cares about his students and wants them to actually learn. Very easy to communicate with and his quips/jigs keep the class interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2010<br>Class Name: CNS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! If you take his class online, just the same as being in class. His lectures are more fun to watch than most professors.  He knows how to explain the material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2010<br>Class Name: CSC262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I take back my rating that I made on 2/1/2010 for lsp course. Though he didn't answer E-mails, I deserved the grade I got. I am taking his programming C++ (II) class now, and he is a great teacher. I was just salty before. Professor Joe rocks, and explains programming in a way that anyone can learn it. And he cares! Plus he's really funny.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2010<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really good guy deserves to be at DePaul forever. Offered to help me in csc 374, 373, and 309. I was even his grader as a graduate student. Take a class with him. Never noticed the jig the other people seem to write about. You have to be passionate about computer science in order to enjoy his class fully.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't do it.

It's been 4 weeks, and still no grade on the second assignment.  The most horrible thing is that he doesn't follow his syllabus, we were supposed to have 5 homeworks and so far we've only had 3 and the final is in a week!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2010<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm finding that I pretty much have to teach myself out of the textbook. Disorganized, therefore lots of backtracking and lack of clarity during lectures. Definitely energized as other reviews say, and always enthusiastic. Insists on in-class group collaboration for newly-introduced topics, which I personally do not find helpful at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>doesn't answer emails. doesn't help you out well. contradicts himself. doesn't give A's when they are deserved. makes the fun sounding alien topic lame</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2009<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor.

His class was a bit wiered, as is he.  The material was mostly reading doing a bit of writing and basically discussing very similar topics every class period. For me, the material was interesting - for the rest of the class it was boring. He is very flexible on the assignment dates and overall a fair grader. Fun class. I would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: CSC393<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Joe is a great guy. Sometimes the code he gives for homework doesn't work properly with a Windows compiler, so start early and ask questions. He's more than willing to help a student. He spent 2 hours after class explaining a concept I didn't understand and answering questions about the homework. Take his class; don't be afraid to ask for help</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this prof if you can. He dances around class and will quite literally tell you how to do the assignments if you ask him in class.
