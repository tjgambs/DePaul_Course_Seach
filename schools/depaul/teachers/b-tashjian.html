She is really understanding and grades really fair. Final and midterm are tough but they are the smaller parts of your overall grade. Just do well on the papers (not that hard) and the final and you should be set. Oh and its all classical music you study not rock or blues. I still learned a lot from her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2007<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>umm, I dont know how all these other students are saying her class is easy. Its not at all. Her quizzes are hard. You have to listen to music & analyze key terms with what you hear, its crazy, I'm not a music major! She expects way too much 4 an intro to music course! yea its boring but she really enjoys what shes doing and she is really nice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2007<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class is SO boring. Esp as a night class. Pretty strict on attendence!! Gives you keyterms/study guide on blackboard for quizes so there's really no point in going to class. 3 quizes.Concert Report Paper and Final. She loves music and she's a really nice prof but its really hard to sit thru the whole period of class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2007<br>Class Name: ART272<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DONT BUY THE BOOKS! go to class and MAYBE that will help you. she gives study guides for tests so all you have to do is look up the terms online if you don't know them and u'll be fine. lots of videos, boring but easy assignments on a music concert and a museum painting. midterm/final-know the study guide and the music styles and you are set.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2007<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very enthusiastic about music, she really loves her job, but if you aren't into music it is kind of a boring class. Assignments are easy, attendance is EASY points! go to class and you wont have to read the book or spend $115!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this teacher is borderline cool and boring. i think its boring because the material is so easy. i think she's cool because she is very enthusiastic about music and teaching it. all you have to do is memorize vocabulary words from the book but it costs $115. boo. you have to write a concert report or report on a composition. not very hard at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice professor and really easy, too.
