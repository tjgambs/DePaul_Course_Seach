Gil is cool, nice and he's really passionate about  his work. But this class seriously made me rethink my decision to add INT as a minor ! There's too many papers to write. I took  INT before so it wasn't  like I didn't know what was expected ! But beware , if you're not sure about the class or the INT program don't waste  your time !</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2015<br>Class Name: INT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class. One of my favorites of INT actually, and that's saying a lot because I love this major.

Yes, his classes are challenging but if you grow as a person and an academic. He will rework and open your mind. You'd be lucky to have him as your professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Understanding and helpful, but still demands a lot from students.

He is one of those professor that can foster and academic experience that allows you to think creatively and learn a great deal.  This is not a blow off class, however, if you read and do you best you will do well</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: INT366<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's awesome</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2012<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intelligent man,he could be intimidating sometimes but very understanding professor. Lots of readings though, 2pages reflection paper due every week, and a movie lab almost every Friday 4 extra credits.

Work MUST be put into the class to get a solid grade. I'm an A student, who is having difficulty in his class (B-/C work :/ ) but it is worth it. He preps students  SO WELL for the rest of the major, which is VERY DIFFICULT!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: INT203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor; however, he often makes things too abstract.

At first I thought the class would be so difficult, but as the quarter progressed he unveiled such interesting and thought provoking content. He is the epitome of what a great Professor is. He cares about his students and wants to make a difference.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: INT366<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gott is the GREATEST PROFESSOR AT DEPAUL. I firmly believe he is the most intelligent man I have ever met. His classes are fantastic, thought-provoking, making you question everything you have ever known. My only aspiration in life is to be just like him in helping make the world a better place. TAKE HIM!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2007<br>Class Name: INTSECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, passionate about the material, decent human being in all respects.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2007<br>Class Name: INT203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gott is a great professor, but he is very opinionated with a strong liberal bias. I think some of the more conservative students in the class were offended by many of his opinions. However, he is an extremely intelligent man. The research paper for the class teaches you a lot about your subject. The readings are also very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2007<br>Class Name: INTX<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What an amazing professor.

He is a lawyer and sometimes he does make simple ideas a bit too complicated, but he really knows what he is talking about.  He is very very nice and willing to talk with you.  I found his paper grading to be good, some people may disagree though.  Take as many classes he teaches as possible!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2006<br>Class Name: INT201203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's so smart, it'll blow your mind.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2006<br>Class Name: INT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not an easy prof.

As many as you can take.  I've never had another teacher quite like him.  He is brilliant and awe inspiring.  He engages the students and fosters open discussions and intellectual thinking.

He allows only one point of view in his classes. Most students allow themselves to be brainwashed, and leave the class thinking they received an education. I am sorry for any student that is subject to his complete ignorance. He refuses to let anyone have thier own opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: 202203301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers.

You're stupid if you don't take advantage of his teachings while you're a student at DPU.  He really believes in his students.  Great inspiration, really knows his stuff, a shock he's a teacher and not changing the world in a more financially rewarding job.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sat in on discussions b/c I was in another prof.'s section and was amazed.

The INT program shines b/c of him.  My colleagues and I are always talking about how lucky we are to have him.
