Haymes is a world famous scholar in both poverty studies and philosophy of education, he taught the best class I took at DePaul. There's students in the education school who are just there to pay for a certificate, but every one of my more thoughtful colleagues considered his class a milestone in their education.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2015<br>Class Name: INT203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty surprised that Professor Haymes is rated so poorly.  I've taken multiple classes of his and I have only good things to say.  I never found him to be a particularly hard grader.  You have to be able to create a quality thesis as well as be able to pick one out of the assigned reading.  He does assign a lot of reading, but it is manageable.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2014<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst professor i have ever met in my life. He does not teach at, he will split the class into groups and expect you to teach yourselves. he's also a very hard grader. please don't take his class except you want to have a loosed understanding of the course. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2014<br>Class Name: SCG611<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is pure philosophy. The prof never teaches anything and just assigns each class to a group of students to teach. I would advise all to avoid this class, if you can. This class is a repeat of all other SCG classes. This class rarely focuses on education in the US in present day and none of this can ever be applied to real life.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Haymes is a wonderful professor. Keep in mind, this is not a methods class, and does not teach one how to be a teacher. Instead, this class is about understanding the education system and thinking of ways to improve it. If you truly care about making changes in education, this class will help you. You just need an open mind.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2014<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't have the most engaging or exciting teaching style, but his class is pretty easy if you just put some time into the three written assignments (which make up your entire grade). The papers are MUCH easier than they seem, too. I didn't necessarily like the class, but I will say that it was pretty easy and required very little work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: PAX214<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Haymes is a unique and intelligent professor. When students were wrong in their analysis or did not get the picture, he would not sugarcoat his disagreement with a "not really" but would say "You are totally missing the point" I respect this honesty, but many don't. I encourage people to take his class. I learned so much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2012<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is based entirely on 2 essays and 1 presentation. He does not take attendance. He's a nice professor although his lectures can be very dull. There is not a lot of work involved in this class throughout the quarter, but just be ready to dedicate at least a day for each assignment. I worked hard those 3 days to earn my A+ in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2010<br>Class Name: PHL380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I literally did about 5% of each reading.. My response papers were no more ever than a page! Participated in class, and still got a B. I feel that he is trying to push to much onto us in a matter of 10 weeks.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2009<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice man but gets so into philosophical discussions that his 3 hour classes are torturous...especially 2 times per week.  Also is not open to others' viewpoints.  Really just wants to speak about minorities' experiences in education.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2009<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is brilliant and often speaks over your head but has some amazing personal experiences.  I learned a lot and he made my brain tired. Be sure to give him a chance.  You'll get out of it what you put into it.  He should put in his syllabus no laptops or cell phones.  I couldn't believe how rude some of my classmates were.  Graduate students&#63;&#63;&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: PAX200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the worst professor I've had at DePaul. He is completely biased, doesn't know/ teach anything other than Columbia-- has no knowledge of any other issues going on in the world. He is condescending and completely rude to the people in class who politely challenge his opinions. STAY AWAY!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2009<br>Class Name: PAX200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly discourage against taking him. Feels very biased. Never presents both sides of an argument. Would practically summarize the readings in class without giving any insight or tying it back in with a follow up lecture. The number of pages that will be due in total for the quarter will be around 48 most of which feels like busy work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: SCG611<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Disorganized, speaks far too quietly, managed to get 2 weeks behind on the syllabus (it's a 10 week class). Lost my first paper and never gave me feedback on it. Would think of something in the middle of class - like an hour long movie - and change the trajectory of the day on a whim. I would not recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2008<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Though he does teach this class at a graduate level I think that even graduate students would want to escape the hell of this class. The class was completely inapplicable to an education major. 2 papers with very little explanation of his expectations decided the grade. No meeting with him to discuss papers. STAY AWAY!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was absolutely terrible!!! He is the worst professor I have ever had! He talks so quietly that when someone moves a piece of paper you cannot hear him. This class does not relate to education in any way. We wrote two papers, and he didn't want us to base our paper off of our notes. This was next to impossible because the readings were confusing. I would avoid taking this teacher!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2008<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is by far the worst class I have ever taken.  I didn't believe the other comments, but they were true.  If you have never taken a philosophy class, you will be completely lost.  He teaches this class like it is a graduate level course, it is not.  Avoid this class at all costs, I wish I would have.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2007<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is difficult.  It challenges your intellect and perhaps your opinions  on many topics.  That being said, I feel I will be a better teacher after taking this course.  I was intimidated by Haymes' low rating, but he is a great professor. It's hard, he's a bit tough to understand, but it is a worth while course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2007<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BORRRRRRRRING! He rambles on in a low whispery voice about stuff that nobody understands and has the nerve to get mad when we don't participate. And here's the kicker: We have to write a 10 page SINGLE SPACED paper on this nonsense. And don't try to escape because he will deduct 10 points for absences. I brought a crossword puzzle to every class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2007<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I do not know what the person below me is talking about. This is the worst professor I have ever encoutnered. The readings are pointless, asking questions is pointless because you will not get an answer. Midterm and Final are both 50 percent of the grade. This class is pointless in general. BORING CLASS...STEER CLEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2007<br>Class Name: SCU380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought Haymes was brilliant. The problem was there were students who didn't read the material and got mad when they didn't understand stuff. Probably the same student who don't have time to read have time to post garbage on here. He's definitely a prof for motivated, intelligent students. Not pitiful goofs that want easy A's.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2007<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was by far the worst class I've taken in my 6 years of undergrad! It's called Philosophy of Education, yet I learned absolutely nothing that could be applied to my future teaching career. For our final we had to write a 10pg single spaced paper which counted for 80% of our grade. Avoid the headaches by avoiding this class at all costs!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WHY IS HE STILL AT DEPAUL&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63; THIS MAN SHOULD BE FIRED, YOU CANT HERE A WORD THAT HE'S SAY8ING, HE PUTS YOU TO SLEEP WITH HIS BORING QUIET VOICE, AND IS A COMPLETE JERK. PLEASE AVOID, I ASKED HIM A QUESTION ABOUT BILDUNG AND HE RESPONDED WITH &quot;BILDUNG IS BILDUNG.&quot; ARE YOU KIDDING ME, GO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2007<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher.Incredibly boring and paused for like 2 minutes after each sentence.He read his lecture from his notes instead of actually having a dicussion with the class.Never responds to emails and was useless for help after class.Doesn't allow you to use anything discussed in class in your papers.Completely ridiculous teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2007<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst prof EVER! his lectures sucked, he does not know how to encourage a discussion. &quot;thoughts&#63; folks are thinking&#63;&quot; does not do it. HIs midterm and final are ridiculous (~6-8 pg single space). irony at its best - its an edu class but i dont think haymes has an edu experience.  adjust your entire year schedule so you dont have to take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Possibly the worst class I have taken yet at DePaul.  Prof. Haymes talked at the class rather than to the class and did not expand explanations even after being asked.  I spent the majority of the quarter just struggling to understand.  Hard grader.  I did all of the assignments and still struggled along.  Best of luck!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a bad class, and the structure forces you to learn or fail. Midterm 40% final 60% both papers. The topics and liberal perspective is interesting, and he will allow discussion on class. However, most student's discussion is based on emotion and calling his argument crap without presenting any logical argument themselves. Do the readings = Pass.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2006<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow... he is BEYOND terrible. I tried, I really tired to participate and offer comments. But every time I made a contradictory comment or opinion, he treated it like I was uninformed and unenlightened (which wasn't true). I really hated his class. I haven't gotten my final grade yet, but I got a B+ on the midterm. He is terrible; stay away!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: LSI380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is horrible!First day of class he told us he doesn't like to give A's.Hard grader, final 60%, midterm 40%.Doesn't explain what he wants, MUST agree with him or else your grade suffers.He speaks so soft you can fall asleep in every lecture!Everyone in my class disliked him!Two thumbs down!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow. he's just....wow. he's boring, monotonous, unfair, ****, very unclear, and doesn't explain what he wants. he's a very hard grader. tip: PARTICIPATE IN CLASS, he picks favorites. avoid him if you can</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: LSE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. One of the best in the school of education. He'll actually challenge you and give you primary texts to read when grappling with philosophical directions in education. None of that textbook stuff you get in t&l. You'll be challenged, which is great if you're smart, bad if you're a gym teacher or SUV driver.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2005<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very smart and knows his material but he has no idea how to teach. This makes it difficult especially when the readings are pretty hard to understand. Also 50% of your grade is on a final paper, 20% on your midterm, and 30% on your final exam. But if you miss ONE class your entire grade is lowered one letter grade. He's a little unreasonable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The main problem with this professor, other than his soft monotone voice, unclear explanations, and inability to understand differing points from other students, was the content: He focused too much criticizing right wing policies rather than exploring the broad philosophical issues in ed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2005<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was very worried about this class at first. I took it as a night class and wondered how I would get through ten weeks of a philosophy night class, but-I was pleasantly surprised at the outcome. This class really made me think. It was interesting but there is a ton of reading. Anyone who is going into education needs this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2005<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>well,he's not my top choice professor, but he is smart.he's a nice guy.he talks soooo low and in one tone,it's a little annoying.but you can just come, take notes, study a little for the test and do okay.if you want an A then you're have to put in a lot more work.but the class is too boring to do that.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extreamly vauge and bitter man</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a great course!  If you read the assigned readings and take part in class dicussion, he is a great professor!  He is brilliant.

Once content is introduced it disrupts the usual &quot;leadership posturing&quot; exercises. I'd liken some ed personalities to failed policemen. Haymes is a top choice for content & philosophy of education.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2005<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>disrespectful and not willing to explain, looks at you as if you are a moron if you ask for clarification.
