Professor didn't teach well. You won't learn anything. You read way too much from printouts. Not even a textbook.

Extremely harsh grader, no textbook but lots of printing of articles. She does not know how to teach, nor does she know how to lead a discussion.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was OK, it was pretty boring though.  Prefessor Erfani wasn't very interesting, but was an easy grader.  I wouldn't really recommend this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was very vague about many of her comments, ideas, and interpretations in class.... Her notes were difficult to understand, and she was bad at encouraging class discussion.  However, she does want you to do well and as long as you comply with her interpretation she will give you a good grade.  Not the worst teacher, but definitely not the best.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The course consisted of having a class discussion between forty students.When asked questions she would answer with &quot;That's a good point we should talk about that&quot; or nod her head.I learned absolutely nothing from this class.The response papers were graded harshly because she did not agree with your interpretation.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
