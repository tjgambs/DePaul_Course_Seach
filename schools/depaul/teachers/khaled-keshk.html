Tough grader on papers but everything else was pretty easy. I wish he elaborated on some things more or gave background info.

I thought the latter. I will say however that for a guy who is so anal about grammar and structure, his emails and posts are very unstructured and lack proper grammar. Hypocrisy?  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2013<br>Class Name: REL116<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Agree with the other student about him grading like an English prof. and not clarifying what he was really looking for in the papers... too many papers with no wiggle room for analysis! He definitely has an opinion that you need to agree with in order to get an A...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dont understand the amazing reviews this professor has.  The guy is seriously way too opinionated to be a professor & wont accept anyone's views if they differ from his own. Extremely hard grader on papers, especially when its about your own opinion.

While its true hes a tough grader, he is also a very fair!!! He is always there if you need help. He's hilarious and truly prepares students for graduate school. If students are serious, they will get so much out of his courses. An A is very dueable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: HST142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class.

You will learn more than ever and actually enjoy it. Hes so clear on directions and what is expected in assignments. The reading is really long but not neccesary.

Funny and nice but his classes are extremly hard!!! The lectures are interesting most of the time, sometimes the class drags. His readings are almost impossible, and he expects you to understand them as if you're the professor. You're not gonna get an A! I read, did all the papers and came to every class still got a B-.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: REL271<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This Prof has no spine at all, lets his students (2 girls rather) run the whole class.The girls are  disrespectful to everyone including the prof.When you have lost ALL respect for the Prof, its a little hard to care about the class itself.Biggest waste of my time and money!Actually thought I would get something out of this class, boy was I wrong!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2006<br>Class Name: REL116<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a good sense of humor, but no direction in his lectures. The topics are always interesting, but he often looses his train of thought. Horrible handwriting, and very difficult to discern what he wants you to remember. You will be challenged to do the reading due to numerous pop quizzes, which makes him a plus in my mind.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2006<br>Class Name: HST223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher,I was so lost in his class, he was very helpful.

To get an A, you have to work hard, just like any other class. He is fair, sometimes flexable, and direct. He will tell you what he expects if you ask him directly.
