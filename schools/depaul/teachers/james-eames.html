Half of his tests are math and physics. Makes it seem like the world is going to end in 50 years. If you don't want to be depressed... do insane amounts of useless work... or enroll in a class with a professor who cares only of himself... STAY AWAY.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: ENV<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible experience with this professor...everyone I have spoken to who has had Eames agrees</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2006<br>Class Name: ENV216<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The ratings for this prof. are under &quot;Marshall Eames&quot;. He is a Jr. so he does not go by the name James. He is J. Marshall Eames and he is a poor professor. He wastes class time and enjoys seeing students toiling over his ridiculously involved assignments. I'm a ENV major and I understand the subject... but he makes everything about math/physics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2006<br>Class Name: <br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
