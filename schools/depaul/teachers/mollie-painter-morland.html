This class was just so confusing. Too abstract. I had no idea what the topic was during each class. It is not hard to do well as long as you attend and participate, but this class was not enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough grader. Notes on the board are bad so you really have to go off the readings and remember what she says and not what she writes down. We have few assignments, little direction on them and they are graded difficultly. She is a nice lady, but philosophy is hard to get if you don't have a professor who is good at explaining things.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2011<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor. Difficult to understand, offers bad notes, and does not explain the readings very well. She's unclear about her expectations for assignments and papers, and is a hard grader. One class protocol and presentation, one response, and two papers (one 6-8 pgs and 8-10 pgs, both 1.5 spaced). Participation heavy. Do not take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2011<br>Class Name: PHL314<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pay attention and be prepared to read and contemplate.  I would recommend reading what is at the end of the syllabus first and then go through the readings.  There is a progression and subtle differences which make for and interesting course study.  Read and listen and you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2011<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She recently had her own textbook published; it didn't even arrive until 6/10wks of the course but made us buy it anyway. She knows a LOT about the subject but cannot teach. She is not clear about what she wants on papers, if there is class, if there is an exam/quiz. Even the TA was confused. Unless you know the subject well, you will screwed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2011<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid if possible. She seems knowledgeable on the subject but cannot teach it whatsoever. Teaches off powerpoints that really dont help much</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2011<br>Class Name: HONHON<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWFUL.  Do not take if you care about your grades.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2009<br>Class Name: PHIL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid if you can. For one her notes look more like football plays.Final exam and midterm online but very confusing. Grades with a bit of Bias.you either agree with her or fail. Assigns reading that are really longno textbook used she posts them online.Would not take anothe class with her. Be sure to be on her good side if you take her,youll see why</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2008<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has to be the most confusing person that I've ever met. She's all over the place & does nothing but talk about South Africa. She's really bias when it comes to debates so be prepared. 1/3 of your grade is based off of group projects. I suggest you look up what a GRI is the first few weeks. She doesn't explain it until 2 weeks before finals.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: PHL230<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She clearly does not care about the grades she gives and does not care about damaging your GPA with the grade she gives.  20% of the total grade is based on a group project which can screw your grade.  Her topics are unclear, and she blames the class when nobody understands what shes talking about instead of considering that it might be her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2008<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty good professor and class. She does operate on a bit of a bias, but overall the class is easy if you attend most of them and participate. Exam questions are straight from the lecture material and readings. She is incredibly intelligent in her field and knows her stuff.... and it doesn't hurt that she's hot also. Getting a &quot;B&quot; should be easy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2007<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>everyone else i know who took business ethics liked it, and said it was easy. she's incredibly boring during class, midterm was tough and the final paper assignment was the longest ive EVER had thus far in my 2 years at depaul. although she is hot</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2007<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This lady reads write from the powerpoints, she wasnt in class a total of 4 or 5 days.  Just overall a stupid class, mid-term is an unclear in-class essay. All she does is talk about her own experiences, she DOESNT teach and then expects you to know what your talking about in the midterm and 8 pg final paper.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2006<br>Class Name: PHL230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class. Interesting subjects. no big pressures here. just try to write good papers, ask her for guidance and LISTEN, because she will tell you what she wants written in the papers</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2006<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, grades easy, and shes pretty hot!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! Google her name, she has a ton of interesting experiences. Actually a professor that knows her stuff and has experience to back it up. She is from South Africa so that also gives you a different perspective. The activities are interesting: debates, GRI reports, group work etc.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2006<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2006<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher.  Never is in class, gives random excuses for not being in class.  Doesn't explain anything that she teaches and doesn't know how to properly teach.  I have learned nothing in this class and really wish I could get my money back.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2006<br>Class Name: TOPICSINETHIC<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not very clear in explaining material, but talk to her during office hours outside of class. If you don't take advantage of her office hours, then remain unclear. Enthusiastic about material, but lets class go off on tangents that become totally unrelated to the topic. Also: Read, read, read! Otherwise she will treat you like an ass.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty easy class especially if attend class.  She is pretty easy with her grading but knows her**** and loves to teach it.  this class is actually pretty interesting, making it not too difficult to attend class, oh yea and by the way she's pretty damn good looking.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2005<br>Class Name: PHL230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes this class challenging, but LOVES people who participate. You can debate your grade at the end of the semester if you are on the border by showing what you have learned on the reading. Difficult class for an elective, but worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at DePaul. She knows what shes talking about. Makes the class fun. Just go to class, and you shouldnt get anything lower than a B for sure. Oh and shes really HOT!!! Hearing her talk is also worth taking this class. Take her and you'll see, its the best class you'll take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Read Below.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2005<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Arrogant, and knows little about actual teaching. She does not know how to relate material to students. If you are a PHL major you might do ok. But if it's a requirement, forget it. She seems to have little respect for none PHL majors as she tends to ignore them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: PHL314<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>you have to do the readings because if not you will fall far far behind.  she discusses the readings but unless you read them then you will have no clue whatsoever.  take this if you are prepared to do your readings on time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: CONTISSUES<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There was a lot of work for this class but it was awesome! She really isn't that bad! The work is interesting and fun! Didn't read much and still passed! works with movies and she has great taste! i'd take this class again w/ her in a heart beat! her accent rocks and she is so helpful!!! TAKE HER!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: PHL327<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Topics in Ethics is not an easy class but is worthwhile.  She is a pretty good looking teacher too.  You have ot be on top of your stuff but the class had mostly interesting reading.  I wouldn't take this class as an elective but if you like philosophy, go for it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: BMS355<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She clearly knows a great deal about the subject.  Long lectures. Hard work.  But don't worry, she's a GREAT grader.  You won't get below a B+ if you're not blind, deaf or dumb.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a very arrogant woman.class discussions are way over everybody's head and she is an extremely tough grader. watch out for her TAs too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The HOTTEST professor I have ever had.  She's seriuosly smoking.  However, she is difficult.  The midterm was practically impossible and the final paper was more than overwhelming.  I do think that the class was interesting & I learned a few things.  Big picture...be prepared to work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2005<br>Class Name: PHL230<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the most unclear, deceptive teacher I have ever taken at DePaul in my course of four years. Yes indeed she knows her stuff, yes there are alot of difficult readings, however, she is so unclear, ambigious, about what she expects out you. All the time she talks about Africa. DONT TAKE HER.....</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2004<br>Class Name: BUISNESSETHIC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was Horrible! I couldn't understand a word she said because of her accent she is an impossible grader.  If u have any questions, dont expect an answer.

She's new to teaching in the U.S. so she mostly gave examples of business in S.Africa. It was interesting.  Very helpful. Debates about case studies. One huge paper at the end of class. But GREAT teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: PHL230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers I've had so far.

Some class days were really interesting others had me falling asleep and sliding out of my chair. She is really passionate about South Africa, and will talk about it all day and finds ways to tie it into the lessons making them more interesting. Take her if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mollie knows the subject well and provides great real-life examples...she has experience in the field of business ethics which makes her class lecture interesting.
