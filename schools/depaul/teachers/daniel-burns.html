Very knowledgeable and tons of relevant experience. You must  follow instructions, participate and attend class.  A good amount of work outside of class. If you go into this class hating IT, then you are doing yourself a disservice. It goes far beyond "IT" and teaches several key career lessons.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2013<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>The professor is highly knowledgeable. He expects you to follow instructions, and if you do it accordingly the class is very straightforward.  There are no midterms or finals, but you are expected to participate, take weekly online quizzes, submit case study reviews, a 10 minute presentation, and some IT new story summaries.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2012<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Daniel is a very solid instructor. He does and excellent job engaging students and providing real world experience. Remember, the MIS555 class structure is set by the university, so selecting a good professor is key. As mentioned below, if you feel this material is boring/not useful, you probably shouldn't be getting an MBA :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2012<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's a class for working people.  Class discussions revolve around real world subjects.  Definitely less quantitative and more qualitative.  Gained a lot of insight that's applicable to my job right now.  If you didn't get anything out of this class, you probably don't need an MBA in the first place. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2012<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have heard all professors for this class are terrible and this rung true when started this class. Participation is 35% of the grade so the discussions in class end up being repetitive and people saying anything so they can receive full credit. Some of the material is interesting but the majority is pointless and I will never use again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2012<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Daniel Burns is a really good instructor. I have enjoyed his class thoroughly and as the mid-term is approaching am already feeling bad his class will be over soon. His approach to teaching is very unique and fun. He keeps the class very engaged and the dialogue going. Though there are no exams,the homework will keep you busy. Highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2012<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is more suited for high school.  There is no actual business school learning.  You read chapters, take online quizzes from the publisher's test bank, and give a presentation the outlines what you just read.  Completely sophomoric.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable and nice guy.  This class requires a ton of work though.  Lots of reading followed up by difficult online quizzes.  No midterm/final but he keeps you really busy!</div></div></div></body></html>
