Amazing class - so interesting. Brought clarity and deeper understanding of the Beatles creative process and how they were truly an artform onto themselves. Enlightening course! Prof Kimsey is passionate about the subject and music -- would definitely take any of his classes. Love his dry sense of humor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2014<br>Class Name: AI185<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>By far one, if not,the BEST online professors at DePaul. His passion for class makes this class SO much. Love his relaxed, encouraging, and inviting online course. Course load was moderate, but I truly enjoyed ALL assignments. Take his class if you have a chance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2013<br>Class Name: SNL000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Kimsey is the best of the best. I have so much respect for him and his intellect. He makes everyone's opinion seem relevant and important. The workload in a Kimsey class is usually large, but the content is deeply interesting and engaging. His classes will blow you away and cover so many perspectives in the process. Kimsey for President.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2011<br>Class Name: SNL0000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Kimsey is amazing. He speaks softly and his mellowness definitely turns some people off, but he's 100% tuned in, on the ball, and brilliant. The low-key style is a facade that he uses to make some very heavy learning go down easy. Best of breed, I've taken 3 or 4 of his classes. Lots of reading, but it's an absolute honor to be his student.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2010<br>Class Name: AESNL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, the best I've had at DePaul so far. Has a soft, gentle manner that some find too mellow, but he's got a huge intellect and great heart.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2009<br>Class Name: SNL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kimsey is an incredible teacher and one of the smartest people I've ever met.
