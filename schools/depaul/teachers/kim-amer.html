Have had her twice. Down to earth, humble, and very patient with students. I have had some professors that tend to make the students' lives miserable because they are miserable, but Dr. Kim Amer was different. Every students loved her. Keep up the great work Amer. You are the best!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2012<br>Class Name: NSG431<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this professor. Kim Amer is every American's dream professor to have. She is down to earth, care about the students and would do everything possible to encourage students that are not doing so fine in her class. This is a class that gives you an easy A if you work hard. She is not the type that makes the students' live a living hell.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: NSG432<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Amer is a nice person. That being said she is not a great professor. Unfortunately, DePaul has few ok professors in the nursing department and you don't get a choice on who teaches you. All of her classes are easy if you just do the work (not even well). She rarely taught me anything new. Always late. Worst resume talk ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a very cool class.

She cancelled 2 out of 6 of the classes and we always got out early. I know that sounds hard to believe, but trust me, its so true and awesome!!!! You totally don't have to pay attention in class and all u have to do is write a paper and do some community service.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2006<br>Class Name: NSGPHAR<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was a complete waste of time.
