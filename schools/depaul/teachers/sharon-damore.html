I have learned more from her than I have from all of my other professors combined.  It was really great that she facilitated our field experiences, whereas some teachers leave you on your own to cold call schools.  Dr. Damore was responsive, organized, and did not waste time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: TL404<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this woman! Her projects may seem a little extensive, but if you follow the rubric you'll be fine. She tells you exactly what it expected of you, so if you don't get an A you're an idiot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2008<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i THINK SHE IS AN OKAY TEACHER.  i HAD TO DO A PRESENTATION WITH MY GROUP AND THEY WERE MEETING DAYS AND TIMES THAT I HAD CLASS SO I TOLD DR. DAMORE AND SHE TOLD ME I WAS A SLACKER AND THAT I WOULD NOT BE A GOOD TEACHER.  WHAT KIND OF ENCOURAGEMENT IS THAT FOR A TEACHER TO MAKE ABOUT THEIR STUDENT&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: TL569<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Student Teaching Seminar.... Well, she didn't really teach...not really sure what to say other than I would of liked our class to provide more support to student teachers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: TL613<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed Dr. Damore's class.  She's a bit hard to figure out and she let's the students do most of the teaching/discussing/facilitating, but she is a nice person and seems to really care.  I recommend taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very ****y lady, not pleasant at all.  Not a helpful class, I didn't learn anything!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2005<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Damore told me that my English was horrible and that I would never be a good elementary teacher. I had to drop her class because she kept giving me D's on my reflection paper. She wouldn't help me at all. I guess she hates asians. Now I have to secondary math.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2004<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She made some questionable comments about black people during class one day, and she said that she couldn't &quot;understand how I got an A in her class&quot; (which I DID!!!). She loves to talk about her Lexus. She's really kind of a ****. I put up with her. Had to take her class.She's condescending & rude.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2004<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2004<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked her and like the class.  I found the class to be a great introduction into the education field.  I learned how to write a detailed Unit plan and she was very helpful with her ideas to improve on it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2004<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unclear. Talks more about her constant vacationing rather than teaching the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She spends more time reminising about her days teaching at her school than anything. Crappy.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
