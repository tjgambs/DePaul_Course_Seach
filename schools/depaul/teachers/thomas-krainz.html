He does ask for feedback from his students about the books and changes them each quarter depending on our thoughts. I had to watch a 4 hour documentary, but he made accessing it easy with multiple scheduled viewings .</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2015<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Krainz is awesome. He is so full of energy and loves to have fun. But he is also a great professor. Just write down what he says and read the books closely and you will get an A. One of my favorite professors at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2015<br>Class Name: HST288<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS PROFESSOR. One of the best i've ever had at DePaul. Hilarious, and really great lecturer. There is a lot of reading, and i think 2 papers. Midterm and Final are in class essays, which sounds really scary, but if you read and take notes during the lecture you should be fine. His lectures are so great, and beyond informative. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2014<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One word HILARIOUS! So many good quotes from him: "John Brown is the man with the questionable mental stability," "Lincoln is the tall, thin one," "Douglas is the short fat one." ALOT of reading (3 books + textbook).  Great lecturer. He's very clear. Midterm, final, 3 quizzes, and 6-page paper. One of the best professors, just too much reading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2012<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Krainz is hilarious and a great teacher! I really enjoyed his class and his passion for social justice really showed through. You definitely should do the readings, they usually are not too bad anyway. I really recommend this professor!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
