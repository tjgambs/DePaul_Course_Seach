Group presentation and paper for the final, three short response papers, online discussion posts, and participation. I'd imagine it's an easy A assuming you just put in some sort of effort. She took awhile to grade, and the class is jaded politically liberal but the volunteering was fun. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2014<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was wonderful!  She speaks quickly and at first is overwhelming but she is always more than happy to repeat what she said or talk more slowly.  She did a great job explaining and was very funny!  My grammar skills greatly improved in her class and we were always encouraged to speak Spanish!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2014<br>Class Name: CSS201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Eight responses due online that are worth 40% of your grade.  Group midterm presentation and final paper make up the rest.  Very easy class, but amazing content!  I thoroughly enjoyed it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2013<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher. She expects a lot from her students. So, you have to work hard in this class in order to get a good grade. She doesn't accept average work. But whenever you are confused, she is always willing to help you!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2012<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Profe Lazu! Her class was challenging, but she is there every step of the way making sure that her students do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2008<br>Class Name: SPN306<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She didn't even print a course reader, saying it would save us money to print it ourselves, which it didn't. She often puts on movies/videos or leaves us to our own devices and leaves class for LONG periods of time. Her lectures sound like they are printed straight off of Wikepedia and are BLAND. Also a hard grader and nothing happens in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WAS AN EASY CLASS. HOMEWORK TOOK A WHILE BECAUSE IT WAS ALL ONLINE ACTIVITIES BUT IT WAS EASY TO GET THROUGH. TESTS WERE SUPER EASY. I DIDNT GET ANYTHING BUT A'S ON THEM. FOR THE TESTS KNOW YOUR VOCABULARY AND YOU WILL BE FINE. FINAL WAS EASY. YOU GET A PARTNER AND ITS AN ORAL EXAM AND TAKES ABOUT 5 MIN. PARTICIPATE OTHERWISE SHE WONT KNOW YOU NAME</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2006<br>Class Name: ABD206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the best class I've taken at DePaul in four years.  The readings are definately long.  She demands a lot from students and you need to be able to keep up.  She is VERY intelligent for being so young.  Shes hot without even trying but shes also kind of fiesty so beware but take a class with her for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2006<br>Class Name: ABD206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is relatively young so she is pretty fun. She encourages participation and is very liberal.  She gives a lot of reading assignments that are very long. She begins class with her notes that you are supposed to take but she talks too fast. She's fun, but a little unclear in assignments. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2005<br>Class Name: 306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class too! This was an INCREDIBLE class.  It was so challenging but an amazing experience.  I almost cried in her de burgos lecture!!!  I agree-- she is very intelligent.  She's so cute too!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2005<br>Class Name: 306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Professor Lazu.  She is the best Spanish teacher I have had at DePaul.  She is hugely passionate about what she teaches and is quite intelligent.  I learned so much from her class and loved the discussions.  She was always entertaining and always made class interesting.  A great Prof!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2005<br>Class Name: SPANISH201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class a long time ago but Dr. Lazu wrote me such a great recommendation for grad school.  And I just got in!  She rocks!  I also TAed for her :-)  She is great to work for, not a micromanager but you won't waste your time. She and Dr. Fereira are the best in the Spanish program!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2004<br>Class Name: LST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sizzling these days...

Hot. Not the easiest grader though and you better pay attention.  Hard exam questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2004<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've actually taken a few classes with her since this first language class.  She is hands down the best.  Really smart woman-- seems to know a little about everything.  In fact sometimes things go a little over my head but she is always willing to help.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2004<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is great but I do not like how she grades papers - more on context than on actual usage of language.  I am glad that she only spoke in Spanish, it was challenging but in the end very effective!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2004<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jackie is great, I like her because she knows what she is talking about and doesn't leave anyone out.  If she see's a student struggling she will make sure they are set back on track.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2004<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2004<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought I understood and liked Spanish until I took her. She is one of the worst professors I've had. She passed out the study guide and then left the class - big help (not). She's very unclear and makes the class harder than it should be.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2004<br>Class Name: SPN306<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dominican Literature, the class is okay, i don't understand a word of Spanish and I hate literature but I am getting by fine; she's a cute, fun gal.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2004<br>Class Name: 203306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken Spanish classes since hunior high, and Sra.

She's an amazing teacher and cares more about her students than any other teacher I've ever had.  The difficulty of her style is average, but she'll work with anyone who requests help.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2003<br>Class Name: SPN318<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is nice, but class dragged sometimes & did not always explain well</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
