It is hard, there is a**** load of reading and his lectures are some of the most confusing lectures ever. He offers little help and grades very hard. STAY AWAY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: BUSINESSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very professional, states his qualifications on the first day of class. Lectures are generally boring but informative. Likes to give &quot;case studies&quot;. Partcipation and attendance play a important role in your grade. Consists of a lot of boring readings. No tests or quizzes other than final which is another case study. Ultilizes &quot;Blackboard&quot; a lot.</div></div></div></body></html>
