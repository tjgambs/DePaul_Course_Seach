I'm now a senior, Economics major with a 3.8 GPA. I got a B in this class but worked super hard. These other comments are accurate. Tests are convoluted MC based solely on his lecture, a method of teaching that should not be used for Econ. If you like the subject and care about grades, do not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All that counts for his class are the midterm and final. His exams had nothing to do with the the readings in the book, they were supposedly based off his notes but you cant understand any of his notes b/c he mumbles.Attendance is mandatory, and he wants everyone to be on time but he is always late.DO NOT waste your time or money taking this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wiltgen lectured from a stack of notes in his textbook but rarely looked at them. Besides not providing any help on sample problems for the exams, the grade for the class was based soley on  midterm & final. Both contained 80-90 questions with essays. Not only were they long, the questions consisted of 5 confusing choices each. I studied for 30+ hours the week of the final and midterm. Ended up with a C- in the class. Worst college class taken to date. At least I passed</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2011<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I have ever had.  How he keeps his job I will never understand.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows his stuff. Lectures might be boring if you're not an Econ major, but if you come to class every day and take notes, you should be fine. The class consists of a mid-term and a final. He also curves.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never been in a class that I hated more. He has no powerpoints or anything to make it easier to learn, he just sits in front of you and lectures. Its only a mid-term and a final, but the 80 multiple choice questions on the tests are nothing like what he says in class. Hes strict on attendence but yet he's always late. DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2010<br>Class Name: ECO330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just be ready to do alot of work. One of the hardest but one of the best classes I have ever taken. Take alot of notes.Final and midterm come from class lectures so write everything down. However, he is no help outside of class. So if you need extra help don't bother asking him because he is usless</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2010<br>Class Name: ECO330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is tough. I have not received my  final grade yet, but wanted to rate this guy as honestly as possible. You need to attend every class, and take TONS of notes.Test are pretty much based off his notes.He speaks fast and mumbles, so it does not help that the test are based off his verbal notes.Honestly,try to take another class, if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2010<br>Class Name: ECO330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy knows his stuff, and is very serious about his class.   However, this particular class, ECO330 requires a high level of understanding the in subject matter, and a personally interest in the material.   Do not take it unless you are prepared to work hard.  The professor is great, although he sometimes talks fast, he's not bad</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When it comes to economics this guy knows his****.  His class is exteremely hard if your not a good test taker because the midterm and final make  up 100% of your grade. I got a C- and still think his teaching method is the best for econ. If you have other econ classes to take, knock one out with this guy and the other will be a breeze.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems clear when he lectures. The problem is that his test don't match what he teaches - meaning he gets his multiple choice question from a book. There 80 on the midterm (40%). and the final is  60%. I never read the book even a little so maybe that was the problem. But I usually never read textbooks and always get As and Bs. Not for slackers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He takes attendance but usually he is 5 minutes late to class. Midterm counts for 40% while the final 60% of your grade (difficult test). The other comments are right about him using the word &quot;alright&quot; often and changing the volume of his voice. He is very knowledgeable of the material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2007<br>Class Name: ECO330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is by far the best econ teacher at Depaul. You will have to study alot, but when its all said and done you will know more than you thought possible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2007<br>Class Name: ECO330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>there's only a midterm and a final and both are challenging. there are 80 multiple choice questions. The thoroughness of his exams do not match his own abilities to teach, so students aren't prepared well enough for his tests. And he is strict on attendance. He is very boring and a tough grader and overall i do not reccomend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Needs to lighten up on the final.

He says &quot;alrightt&quot; and &quot;OK&quot; after everything he says and often switches his voice to that of a high pitched girl. He's odd for sure, but the class is alright actually. Show up, TAKE NOTES, and you will do fine. Curves the tests immensely! I had a C- and got an A-. he sounds weird as heLL</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! You hvae to pay attention and take notes to do well. Tests are curved and he is very willing to help. He has great knowledge about the material and can teach it better then any text book. If you really want to learn take this prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you really want to learn, take him, if you just want the credit DON'T!! The whole class is based on attendance, midterm, and final which are both hard, he doesn't give you a study guide, only based on whether your a good note taker. i came to every class, took notes like a secretary and i got a D, maybe i'm stupid but i passed my other classes</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher sucks.

EVERYTHING on the exam he went over in DETAIL during class.If you pay attention you will get an A and he can't be blamed for being a jerk to you if you're stupid.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is a horrible teacher and can care less about his students. If you are a teachers pet, he will be nice to you. He is not clear at all and his tests are extremely hard. He claims to grade on a curve, but he doesn't know the meaning of the word. He is dumber than a rock and is very offensive when you ask questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: ECON<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what to say except that he comes off like a jerk, but his lectures are fairly interesting. Exams are incredibly hard, so make sure you keep up with the reading and do all assignment, and study your rear off before taking his exams, otherwise you will not do well. Overall, Very difficult, Not recomended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: MACROECONOMICS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a horrible man that teaches off the top of his head and could care less about you.

It seems that a lot the people who rated him have difficulty doing that.    He is a hard grader but not unfair.  All you have to do is try in his class and you'll be okay.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher, worst teacher I have ever had in my life.

Very Bad Professor. I honestly think he takes PRIDE in the fact that no one does well in his classes. I think he arranges it that way.

Wiltgen doesn't give a rat's behind who you are, why you are taking it, and if you understand it.  He is there to make us fail by not grading for our efforts, and purely basing our grade on 2 outrageously difficult exams.  He enjoys failing students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh my gosh, he talks more about the hsitory of economics rather than the material that we need to know. Long, boring repetitive midterm and final. Asks the same questin at least 5 times in the exam. Go to class cause attendence counts.

I took him for socialist econ and hated every minute.  Loved the books, but you don't need them.  He was a self proclaimed socialist, until he inherited a lot of money.
