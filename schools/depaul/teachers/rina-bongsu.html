The reading material was helpful and interesting. She answered most emails within 24 hours. Her directions are relatively simple, but she will answer any questions you have. You have to write a paper and make a portfolio which is actually kind of interesting. I would def. suggest her! Easy A if you keep up with the work!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2006<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class seemed very easy in the beginning.  You do basic discussions and some papers.  However, all the fun comes at THE END WHEN YOU HAVE NO CLUE HOW YOU GOT A GRADE YOU GOT.  Do not take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2005<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>READ the directions very carefully. Alot of work but it is easy. She sends alot of emails and if you dont read them all, you may miss something important. Easy A if you can follow directions!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2004<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too much online work!
