Must take for arabic. You can learn all lectures online which makes the material very understandable. She does everything in her power for you to get an A.  Show up, study the material and complete the homework. If you are genuinely interested in learning arabic you will love her!! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: ARB101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Dababneh is easily the most caring professor I have ever had (graduate and undergraduate). She will push you (and Arabic is not an easy language to learn), but it's out of faith that you can learn the material. She has created all of her own great resources and is incredibly organized. There are few professors like her. Take her course!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2014<br>Class Name: A<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>THE BEST TEACHER EVER.  I have never had such an amazing teacher.  I took her for ARB102 and 103 and would have loved to keep taking her if she taught 104.  Her class was super long, but everyday it went by fast.  The material was fun and she made sure we understood.  Great, great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2014<br>Class Name: ARB103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly Recommend Professor Sweis. I took her for 101-102 & 103. I would have taken her for 104 is she taught it. Overall this course is good. 1 Midterm and 1 Final Exam, Along with a Final Project which turned out to be Fun. (We made a 10 page storybook entirely in Arabic) Prof. Sweis Helps you with homework and double checks everything for you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2014<br>Class Name: ARB102103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>MAHA IS LITERALLY THE GREATEST. She will go above and beyond to make sure that her students have every possible resource necessary to succeed. She is the most caring faculty member I have encountered at DePaul, and probably the most organized as well. I wish I could take all of my Arabic credits with her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2014<br>Class Name: ARB103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Maha truly is one of the best teachers I've EVER had! She truly cares about her students, and even gives out her cell number if students need extra help. As long as you do the homework and try your best in her class you will succeed. What an amazing person and professor!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2014<br>Class Name: ARAB101103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Maha is such a boss. I've never had a professor who cares about their job as much as Maha. I was skeptical at taking Arabic but Maha pushed to the limits because she said she's knows anyone can succeed if they try. Pay attention and do the hw. Very easy as long as you try and study. Plus she gives EC as a boost to help. BEST TEACHER EVER!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2014<br>Class Name: ARB103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>course was hybrid, with a lot of material online that showed extensive work by the professor. She is one of the most engaged professors I have ever had, she was very helpful, and she made the course interesting and fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2014<br>Class Name: ARB101103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>The best teacher you will ever meet! She is a blessing and cares for all her students so much it's insane. I have never met a teacher that cares about her students learning more than Maha. Please, take every class you can with her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2014<br>Class Name: ARB101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best professor I have had in three years at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2013<br>Class Name: ARB101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Maha is the nicest professor I've had at DePaul. She's always available for help before and after class, and she genuinely wants her students to succeed. The class itself was not too difficult, and she allows you two absences. I loved having her as a professor, and will be taking her for any Arabic class I can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2013<br>Class Name: ARB103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Maha is the best Arabic professor ever!
