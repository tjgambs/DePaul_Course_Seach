He's funny and he's not too old so we can relate to him as students. He knows his material, and he has a lot of "real world" experience; in fact he shares some stories in class. No homework, no midterm, and no attendance required. Do the weekly labs and do decent on the final, you'll an "A".</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2013<br>Class Name: TDC488<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most brilliant instructors in my professional career.  The guy is the real deal.  If he is talking:  You need to be listening.  He is the best of the best.  Be prepared to work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2012<br>Class Name: TDC477<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Deron is one of the best instructors I've had at DePaul.  You better be prepared to work hard, research a LOT, and stay very current with reading and homework or you WILL fall behind fast.  His class is very real-life - almost like a consulting environment.  Review is links - he posts a lot.  They are a course by themselves.  Great experience!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2010<br>Class Name: TDC477<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Deron is hands down the best teacher I have had at DePaul (not to mention he is a total beefcake ;) ).  His work in the field provides an element to his teaching that I feel a lot of professors are missing.  Everything you learn is relevant and interesting.  His homework assignments are beneficial.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2009<br>Class Name: TDC477<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He didn't use textbook, only used sites off web and online books.Which DePaul gives you access to.The lectures was very informative.If you are taking him in the summer there is only one final that is worth 40% of your grade.Grading is very fair.Make sure you stay on top of your work.It is very easy to fall behind.The class is very doable.TAKE HIM</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2008<br>Class Name: TDC477<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Instructor, Very knowledgeable and helpful.
