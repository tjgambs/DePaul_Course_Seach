He's incredibly easy to talk to and learn from.  I've never had a professor who I've felt cared about my opinion more than Staley.  He's completely fair in terms of work and grading.  I would take this class a million times over. If you love sports this is for you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Although some of the assignments with the NYT are tedious, at least we are actually reading relevant information. Always upbeat and very invested in the student's engagement and achievement.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Very dedicated prof, one on my favorite at DePaul! Truly cares about his students. The work required effort and wasn't easy, but he incorporated the NY times which was more current and interesting to learn and discuss in class. Very personable and kind about your view on grades.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a fun class that never got boring because the assigned readings were very humorous and we did different things each day. We watched videos, had small and big group discussions, and it was just fantastic. Prof also has a light sense of humor which is nice when you're cranky in the morning and don't want to be there.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Staley just started his baseball focal point class and it was a lot of fun. We had to read for every class which was a bummer, but every session was a discussion and debate on the readings. The assignments and papers aren't to difficult and there is a lot of room for imagination.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Staley is AWESOME. He is so lenient with everything, he's hilarious, and always make class fun. I looked forward to his classes. Take him if you can...without a doubt.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a bad guy, but I hated his class. Hated when people talked and he was extremely picky about everything in papers. You have to try hard when doing his work, thats for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic writing professor. Taught me a lot and challenged me unlike any other writing teacher I've had before. I'm genuinely upset he doesn't teach any other higher-level courses.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm in my third quarter of my first year at DePaul. I had him during the summer session before college starts. He is so lenient, well organized, liberal, caring, humorous, awesome, fair grading and nice! He'll grade your papers ASAP and even give you thorough feedback on your drafts. If you can, he's a must!!! If only my other classes were flexible</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2012<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fair grader and really cared for his students. Also very engaging and fun, extremely approachable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Staley is awesome. He's hilarious and makes class fun. You're supposed to read the textbook outside of class but he never really says anything about it. You barely get any homework and the research paper only has to be 8 pages and it's due at the very end of the quarter. Definitely take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. Every class flew by. He is serious when it comes to getting work done and attendance, but if you actually try you will get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2011<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is an awesome professor.  You'll be able to get above B+ if you paid attention in class. If you had him once, you'd wish you could have him again. I hope I can get in his WRD104 class next.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the best teachers i've ever had. Was extremely helpful, thoughtful, funny, and really made going to class a ton of fun. Very fair grading, improvement means better grades, and will always be willing to talk about your work. Wants you to succeed.

Not too demanding. He is very understanding and knows the subject. Three big essays, some short readings, final portfolio with all of your writing assignments throughout quarter. Takes attendance every class. Allowed to miss 6 classes. Overall, great teacher. Would recommend.
