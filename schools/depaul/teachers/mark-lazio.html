He tries hard to make it better though, he's a young teacher (like 26), so give him time and he may be great. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark was a great professor. At first I didn't think the class would work well considering he's pretty young, however it was quite the opposite. He more than well knows what he's doing and everything you do in that class is designed to make you a better writer. He gives great feedback on essays and explains things really well. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark is incredibly clear with anything and encourages discussion and debate. He always loves when a student disagrees with him and will have a very civil discussion, and really listen to what the student is saying. He is also more than happy to go out of his way to ensure your success in the class</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
