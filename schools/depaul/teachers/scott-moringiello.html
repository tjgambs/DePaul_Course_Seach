If you want to take a religion class, I would most definitely recommend him!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2015<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Dr. Moringiello for CTH 180 and I have to say that he made a Catholicism class interesting and fun to go to.

His lectures are funny and as long as you don't mind the outside reading, this class will be awesome. There are three, three-page papers you have to write throughout the quarter but Dr. Moringiello is very helpful. He is flexible with grading if he knows you are trying. </div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
