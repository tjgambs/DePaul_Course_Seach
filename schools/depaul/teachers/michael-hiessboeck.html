Expect a lot of power points. At the end of the quarter you will make game prototypes in a group. Don't go for your favorite idea, go for the most hardworking groupmates as you will be SOL if you have dead weight group members</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2013<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mischa was very enthusiastic about the subject and actually made the class much more interesting. His tests are so easy as long as you study for about an hour or two. The papers were somewhat long but not difficult. He was always willing to help which is good because his assignments were often unclear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2012<br>Class Name: GAM208<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Meh... the title of the class sounded exciting, but his method of style didn't make the class that enjoyable. Not hard at all, but a lot of reading to do in a short amount of time. His Austrian accent might be hard for some people to get past, but he's understandable for the most part. Wouldn't recommend his class though.</div></div></div></body></html>
