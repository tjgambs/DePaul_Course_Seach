Relevant coursework. Easygoing kind of guy. Fair grader. Attendance not mandatory. Real world experiences and applications. Not your typical case study class. Participate a little and get your work done and you'll be good!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2012<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers at depaul.

The class was a case study class which most people dread, but he made the class interesting, interactive, and also gave us a live case study to work on with a real company which made the class more interesting and not so boring. He really is a great professor. I don't understand the negative feedback. It's wrong!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2011<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ehh...not what i expected...ok class i guess..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2011<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hernandez knows his material, but the class is boring. Good amount of readings, but not bad if you find the concepts of marketing interesting as I do. I had to put in more work than I had imagined. Wish I had taken this class with another professor, but oh well you live and learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2011<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes a very nice guy, but gets down to business. Your going to have to keep up with the readings and study in order to do well. Don't take this class expecting an easy A or B, not going to happen I learned the hard way. Good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2011<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, nice guy.

Such a nice guy. He knows his stuff and applies it to class. Can be dry at times. Provides power points which he goes over in class. He pretty much tells you what will be on his quizzes from the slides. he drops your lowest quiz score. Finals is cumulative over quiz materials. Show up, pay attention, participate, get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2010<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Hernandez is amazing! He works full time and teaches at night... I had a last minute issue with taking final on last day of class and he was willing to come in after work on a day he's off just for me! Seriously, who does that!&#63; This guy is the best! The class is interesting and very easy to get an A. Final is questions from quizzes.. takehim</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2010<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher I am taking him again for my second MKT requrement.  Very straight forward, helpful. He tells you what questions will be on each quiz during the lectures. so as long as you attend, you'll be fine. He combines quiz questions in the final. Also there are a few presentations and class activities. Highly recommend to take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Uses clear and accurate slides, and gives great real world examples. 4 multiple choice quizzes, drops the lowest one. Remember them because he uses the same questions for final. In lectures he tells you info that he says he will use in quizzes, so write it down. Final is multiple choice and 5  short answer. will take him for 310</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2009<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super easy. Dont buy book. He gives answers to the 4 quizzes you take, you drop lowest score. 1 ppt presentation with group on something you bought. if you go to class early he gives some answers to quiz before you take it. Go to every class and you should get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Adjunct from Robert Morris, really great guy, 5 quizzes based on lectures, gives you 1/2 the answers, no midterm, final is a joke, group presentation & short paper in which he gives everyone A+'s. Take him!</div></div></div></body></html>
