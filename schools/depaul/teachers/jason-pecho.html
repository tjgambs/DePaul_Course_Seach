Class is pretty simple, but just pay attention and show you and you'll be fine. For the 5 papers you write, they are very very simple, and not more then 1 page long. YOU PLAY A GAME FROM A LIST, and write a 1 page paper about it.... how easy can it get&#63; and their ps3/xbox 360 games..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was kinda redundent, but he was a really cool guy.  Fun to talk to if you like video games and very chill about grading/homework.  Easy class, but still enjoyable.  Makes you really think about how games are thought up, as obvious as some things covered may seem.  Plus, playing video games for homework!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jays an amazing teacher, have to write 5 papers (1 page each). Always let out 20-30 min. early, if not earlier.  1/2 class lecture 1/2 a game.  No Final exam, but project.  He is an extremely helpful teacher, allows you to retake pretty much anything.
