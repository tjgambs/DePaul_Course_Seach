Don't be scared off by your first impression - while she is definitely an intense person, this is only because she cares deeply about her work (and yours!). She will push you to grow as a readerwriterlearner, and you will feel so fulfilled & rewarded by the end of the quarter. Learning w her is a privilege.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2012<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a bit condescending to freshmen/other students who are new to the English major. I would recommend avoiding her until you're in the 300-level courses.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2009<br>Class Name: ENG390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Rinehart a few years ago for Early Amer. and my Sr.Capstone.  She was my favorite professor.  I found her to welcome and validate others' opinions.  She is the type of instructor who really wants to see her students succeed without dumbing down the material.  Don't take her if you don't plan on investing yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2009<br>Class Name: ENG390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable but requires a lot of dedication. Many homework assignments. Learned a lot from her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: ENG360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a phenomenal professor, as long as you conduct yourself professionally and seriously.  I've yet to come across someone so vastly knowledgeable and such a talented lecturer within this department.  I recommend her if you're very serious about your major and are ready to work closely with the material.  It's certainly an enriching experience.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2008<br>Class Name: ENG474<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Condescending, inconsistent, and self-absorbed! She refuses to consider any perspective outside of her own and treats inquisitive students like mental patients.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2008<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  So smart.  Has so much passion for what she teaches. She really pushes you in the class, though--not an easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2007<br>Class Name: ENG206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rinehart is pretty difficult but completely worth it.  She really tries to give you your money's worth, and it's too bad my class was rather lacking in enthusiasm.  Her personality is a little off-putting, but she actually teaches you what literary criticism is all about and how to go about doing it correctly.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2007<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very difficult grader, but I think that offers a sense of self-reflection of work ethic that isn't available in other classes.  You definitely cannot just &quot;skim by&quot; this class.  You either work hard or you don't do well.  Also, her lectures and discussions are fun, because they're basically not boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG360<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's one of those teachers that are really good, BUT think their class is the only thing going on in your life.  She gives tons of homework and grades extremely hard on papers.  However, she's extremely smart, entertaining, and nice.  It was the only thing that kept me awake in the funeral that was Early American Lit</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2006<br>Class Name: ENG390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I only wish I could have taken her sooner in my college career. She's extremely enthusiastic and helpful, not to mention mind blowingly intelligent and knowledgable. She had an open mind about the direction of the class and really respected each student's ideas and opinions. A++++</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: ENG360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOTS of work.  If you want an easy A you've got the wrong prof. Some students are intimidated others lazy, but if you're willing to put in the time you will walk away satisfied.  Lots of academic jargin. Often slightly condescending, but with good reason. She is brilliant and her elevated discourse is accessible through pop culture examples.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2005<br>Class Name: ENGGRAD<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree that she does not welcome any opinion but her own Very intellegent but not able to focus on the reading for the day Spent entirely too much time discussing our final paper Part of every class was spent on it Save that for the undergrad course. Got the impression she really does not believe that students are capable of writing a paper Avoid</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: EARLYAMERLIT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was not easy.  But she is wonderful.  Adroit in her field, and attuned to pop culture.  I liked that she used and defined unfamiliar terms. Words are good.  She was also very helpful.  She even had a workshop separate from class after our first paper to discuss anything even the most basic difficulties.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2005<br>Class Name: VARIOUSENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Rinehart was my least favorite person at DePaul. She did not welcome any other interpretation other than her own. I felt she was often unfair and I avoided any further classes with her. I do not recommend her - also, her reading list was excessive and she seemed to think she was the only class I had. Smart woman though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: AMERLIT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>woa, a genius in her field. works your ass off and it is worth it. enjoys creativity in the classroom. an awesome person.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2005<br>Class Name: EARLYAMERLIT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Why is this woman a tenured professor&#63;  She could not be more full of herself!  Funny that someone mentioned the fact that she and her husband make fun of students' papers; I was actually in her class when she told that story.  Totally inappropriate.  Rino also called a girl &quot;dyslexic&quot; while the student was reading in class.  Go back to New York!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2005<br>Class Name: ENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2005<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Rinehart is smart, but should stick to writing in scholarly journals and not teaching. Her diction is distractive and she is unable to get her lesson plan across due to her emphasis on making you realize how poor your vocabulary is. Do not take her, unless you like getting your head pounded repeatedly with a walking Webster Dictionary.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is extremely knowledgable about what she teaches. There is a lot of work and it is difficult, but she will always meet with you and is very kind and warm one on one. It's somewhat difficult not to be put off by her at first, but just get through it and you'll be fine(she is smart and knows it.)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: ENG360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof R made it through a LOT of stuff in a very short amount of time and I actually learned most of it. Upbeat, dedicated, easy to reach outside of class. Does have an academic &quot;I'm smarter than all of you&quot; attitude, but you know what&#63; She is. She's entitled. Live with it and learn from the best.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENGLISH400<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for my capstone class, and she was awesome. Not only did I learn a lot, but I worked hard, and she rewarded appropriately. Very upbeat and fun lady. I highly reccomend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2003<br>Class Name: ENG469<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very enthusiastic, intelligent, and experienced professor. I greatly enjoyed her class and found the discussions thought-provoking and balanced.  You will work for your grade and she expects good papers, but not an impossible class.  Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2003<br>Class Name: ENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was never my professor, but she was my advisor while I was in the English program (before I switched to Education).  She was difficult to get a hold of/make and appt. with, and once I got one, very unclear about what I needed to take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2003<br>Class Name: ENG400<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was challenging, but not impossible.  She's very knowledgeable.  I would have liked the class more had she encouraged more students to speak up.  The same three people spoke all the time!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2003<br>Class Name: ENG360<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2003<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hard grader, but knowledgeable. be prepared to be called on at random</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2003<br>Class Name: ENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talks constantly and does not welcome any difference of opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2002<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very enthusiastic and intelligent, expects a lot but you will learn a lot</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
