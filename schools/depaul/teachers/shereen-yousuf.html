She is lenient with attendance. No textbook. There are only two papers, a midterm, and a final. You don't have to do the readings to pass the class and everything on the tests are taken from discussions, so if you go to class you should pass. Beware of group project.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2015<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Shereen is a great professor with a ton of potential. She's very passionate about Intercultural Communication. The classes can seem long and boring at times, but so it goes with some of the required topics. I recommend her for Communication majors who need to take 103.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: COM103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simply the worst professor at DePaul!  She is extremely unorganized and was late to every class. Going into  finals week,  she was four weeks behind in grading  papers.  Would not recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: COM103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice person; however, it is almost impossible to understand what you need to "know intimately" for the purpose of doing well on the midterm and final.  Class discussions ALWAYS get off topic and they are necessary to understand. She is also an  unnecessarily tough grader. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For a level 100 communication class this course is way harder than it should be. She is very nice but her lectures are very bias, so much so that it made many members in my class very upset. Her exams are very specific, and her questions are vague. She is an extremely hard grader, and for some reason refuses to give out A's. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2014<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely the hardest communications teacher I've had at DePaul. She is very nice but the entire class is discussions so it is hard to do well on the exams. The exams are very specific and she is a hard grader when it comes to the papers. I would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2014<br>Class Name: COM103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor, super engaged in her work and all around passionate about her career. She really cares about her students and that comes through in how she teachers and the positive environment she creates for her students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2013<br>Class Name: COM103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is young, sweet, and easy to work with. Assignments are weekly 1 page papers that are not hard and a couple bigger papers as well as mid term and final that are also not difficult as long as your engaged. Recommend for easier grade when other classes are demanding.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
