The tests can be difficult, you have to really KNOW the material for the multiple choice, but she drops your lowest test score.

The prof went through lectures with so much enthusiasm & clarity. To the one poster, you must've really been turning in crap. I mean, the 3 assignments were super easy and the lowest was dropped. Weekly quizzes served to reinforce readings/notes. 3 tests, lowest dropped too. Dr. Reyna is one of the greatest prof.s I've had.

Attendance is worth 5-10 points each class, depending her mood. Every week u must take an online test, but many times were unable to access the test bc she set the due date as the day before. she got very angry when students sent emails.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2009<br>Class Name: EXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HER EXPLORE CLASS!!

You can't get a hold of her if you need help. She doesn't grade anything herself. She switches online quiz times. She acts like just because she has a smiley personality that makes her a fun teacher.

She forces you to go to class with attendance points, then posts all of her lectures online. I could have taught myself the material in half the time.

Not a psych major, but still managed to get a B+ on my first psych course (a 300 level!), so not hard. Just do the work and listen to lectures--test q's will seem easy. Weekly quizes are a must and are kind of challenging, but tough essay grader. Good overall.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2007<br>Class Name: PSY364<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for Soc PSY. You have to go to class, bc her online quizzes are mostly from lectures, and she will also throw in questions in the exams that she went over in class. She gives really good examples, and can make you understand the material. I worked hard,never missed a class, and got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2006<br>Class Name: SOCPSYC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>smart but full of it sometimes!  She criticizes everyones writing skills on their papers but doesn't even grade them herself!  She has her TA's grade everything for her bc she is too lazy.

Go talk to her if you need ANY kind of class help and she will deliver... but maybe I just had a good experience. You'll work hard and I don't know how I only got a B+, but she's not bad.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the worst teacher I've ever had, and if she's not, she's certainly my least favorite.

She thinks it is cool to act dumb or like a airhead or something. I don't understand it. She seems too busy for students and not interested in being a professor.
