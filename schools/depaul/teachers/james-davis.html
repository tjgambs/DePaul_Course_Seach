His feedback on assignments can be unhelpful, but if you ask him directly, he'll be more than helpful. Attendance not mandatory, but there are a couple super easy assignments each week. I would definitely take his class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2015<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good professor for sure. But the research paper at the end of the year is a little excessive for a class that is about math and excel. There shouldn't be a paper period. But the rest of his class is very good and actually applicable to the real world. Good guy, good professor, easy grader, but leave the papers to English classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2014<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, you really know what he is talking about! I took this class as a 3 hour night class and always got out within the first hour, which was awesome. The final project was a pain but he was a fairly easy grader and gave great feedback! Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof.Davis is great! Clear with requirements to succeed and lecture during class. If you attend class and do your assignments you are sure to do well. Having no real interest at onset of class, I am super glad to have had this course as it will help guide my future. Who knew Excel could be so cool! Yes, he is pretty cute to boot :)Highly Recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2011<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Jim Davis! He's so helpful and tried his best to make stats interesting and fun. One activity and homework per week for the night class plus a final and midterm. Study the powerpoints and you will do well on the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2011<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is okay. Some material are hard and some are hard. The professor is good though and he will help you when you need it. He won't treat you bad and he is very nice. His grading is kind of tough so make sure you do a good job on your hw. Otherwise he is a good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2011<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes everything very clear and outlines what he expects on the first day. The midterm and final were both easy as long as you look at all your notes. There were weekly hw assignments but they aren't difficult at all. You also won't need the book if you go to every class. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Davis is awesome. If you are looking for an LSP professor to take, i'd STRONGLY suggest him. he was awesome and was very clear with what he wanted. Midterm and Final were a lot easier than i expected. Do what he wants and it's an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a good teacher, I got an A and I suck at math and statistics and all that stuff. He took the time to meet with me after class and answered all my emails regarding our projects/final exam. Overall, I wouldn't have gotten an A had he not been my professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2009<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely absolutely without a doubt take this professor! He was so helpful and his powerpoints were very detailed and informative. He also made me laugh..in a statistics class. Not an easy thing to do! TAKE HIM!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor.

He was always interesting and funny and he made the material interesting. He clearly explained all of the concepts as well. Attendance was not mandatory, but he made it worthwhile to have to get up at 8 in the morning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is not only really hot, but he's also really helpful. Im not a big fan of math classes but he made it enjoyable, and didn't mind us doing to in class activities while he presents his power point.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super attractive, very friendly and extremely helpful. TAKE HIM! He will never put you on the spot. His power point presentations have funny pictures, makes it easier to pay attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a cool guy.
