She defiantly knows her material. This class we learned about Doing Digital History and our final compromised of making a Podcast and have a transcript to follow along with it. (Along with minor web-page insertions) I recommend this class and this Professor. Give her respect and you will receive it back.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2014<br>Class Name: HST299<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Sylvester is an amazing professor. She is always enthusiastic about History, and is always very eager to lend a helping hand. Her workload is not easy, but you will learn a ton, and come out of it a much more competent student and historian. I would recommend Prof. Sylvester to anyone interested in one of the classes she teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2013<br>Class Name: HST209<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing prof. She has a true passion for the subject, and passes it onto the students. This is a very reading-heavy class. And her papers are difficult until you figure out how to write them the way she wants you to. But she is always more than willing to give any assistance she can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2013<br>Class Name: HST208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an amazing woman with a wealth of knowledge! She makes her students work hard, but in the end rewards those who actually try. She as a lot to offer and is more than happy to help her students. She truly wants her students to learn and understand...take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: HST353<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the more challenging and rewarding classes I've taken at DePaul. If you want to dedicate SUBSTANTIAL amounts of time to reading and comprehending complex ideas, this is a great class. Not recommended for people who aren't willing to struggle some or those wanting an easy A. A must for Russian/Soviet studies.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2011<br>Class Name: HSTLOTS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had several classes with Dr. Sylvester. She's brilliant and is very responsive. She has high expectations. If you work hard and are able to defend your work, she can teach you a great deal. In addition, she is extremely personable, and I'm proud to consider her a friend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2010<br>Class Name: HST209<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic professor. Has an unrivaled passion for teaching, especially regarding the USSR. The class was far from easy, but she did everything she could to make her expectations clear and consistent.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2008<br>Class Name: HST397<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is by far the best professor I have had at DePaul.  She is engaging and always challenges her students to work hard.  I have learned a great deal from this prof.  If you are willing to work hard, than you will reap the benefits.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2008<br>Class Name: HST397<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst experience of my entire college carrier came from Dr. S in the form of my Senior seminar. Don't take this class if you think that you are going to have a say in the topic of the culmination of what you have learned in school, there is no room to choose. I have never written on here, but I tell you now friends: RUN!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: HST209<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is by far, the best professor i've had at this school.  you MUST take her --especially if you're a history major!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: HST209<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree that this is college and you should have to work hard for a decent grade. However, the amount of reading is ridiculous. She expects you to spend 3 hours for every hour in class, thats fair enough, but the reading and preparation for class will take you more like 6 hours a day. She made russian history way more difficult than it should be.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2008<br>Class Name: HIS421<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Demanding course, but this is college.  She put forth a rigorous syllabus.  Because of the course, however, I am better prepared to succeed in the future than I was before.  If you really want to get something out of a class, then take her.  If you are looking for the easy way out, then why are you in college&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2008<br>Class Name: HST209<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>in her own words:&quot;put up or shut up.&quot; she demands you to work like you are at a real college and it pays off. she knows everything, she is funny. one of the best at depaul! do yourself a favor and take the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2008<br>Class Name: HST219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>2 words about this professor: Yale Graduate. Shes friendly but that will go away if u fall anything short of her expectations from you. Definetly not a walk in the park - must put in time and effort. Shes respectful but challenging and tough. This is college - you gotta work. This is one of those classes where ull end up learning a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2007<br>Class Name: HIST199<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>at first i was terrified of this woman she comes off very mean but once you get to know her she is great! she really helps her students alot and yes there is alot of work but it really helps you prepare for future classes</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2007<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BE PREPARED TO WORK HARD. hours of reading for each class, footnoted papers due at the beginning of every class, killer final paper. you'll learn a lot, but DON'T expect to get an A.  you'll work hard for a B. participation will help. don't fall asleep and don't miss class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2007<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall she knows what she is talking about but she is a very hard grader. &quot;Admission Ticket&quot; (1pg paper) every class and there is lots of reading, at least 3-5 hours each class. i think its very hard to get an a in this class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2007<br>Class Name: HST421<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very hard teacher with a lot of work, be prepared to spend at least 20 hours of week studying and writing papers for her class. She is a hard grader as well, however it will be the most rewarding class you will take and you will have a lot of knowledge after you complete it, basically read a book a week and write a paper and discuss.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2006<br>Class Name: HSTSOV<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you dont like to work dont take her classes (and drop out while youre at it). She sticks to her syllabus and is no joke. Work hard and you can learn alot. Slack off and you get what you deserve. One of my favorite teachers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2006<br>Class Name: HST387<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've only had Sylvester once and she was the hardest teacher and class I have ever taken. But this was one of the most rewarding classes I have taken; I learned a ton. If you take her class, keep up with the readins (cant stress that enough), if you do that then youll be fine. She is very helpful if you go see her after class so do it. I got my B+.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2006<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Scared me to death at first but I stuck it out and learned massive amounts.  She had moments of coarseness towards us but only rarely.  Generally a personable, articulate, incredibly intelligent, patient professor.  Will look over your intro paragraph and give comments; responds to emails very quickly.  What a college honors course ought to be.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2006<br>Class Name: HST208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>excellent professor- cares passionately about the subject and expects you to as well (or at least don't insult her by blatantly not giving a damn). approachable and eager to help. keep up with reading (theres a lot) and get to class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2006<br>Class Name: HST208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i am only going to say this once if you get her for any class drop it and go find another one. unless you like to listen about how she is so much better than you in this subject.

I decided to suck it up and the class actually became my most rewarding AND most difficult class of the quarter.  Midterm and Final week is very stressful due to the challenging paper and final BUT worth it if you want to learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2005<br>Class Name: HST208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very intimidating woman, but an excellent professor.  She expects a lot from students, yes, but you get a lot out of the readings and her lectures.  I don't think she's a very hard grader at all.  Take this class if you've got time to read a lot and are willing to put forth the effort.  Great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2005<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh god... run for your life. Easily one of the worst nightmare professors I've ever encountered. Class was really difficult, the amount of information you were expected to know is CRAZY. She's not helpful and can often be spiteful if you are not one of her favorites. Super stressful, completely not worth it.

IMPOSSIBLE amount of work --trust me-- CRAZY expectations. Hard grader, 100's of pages due every class plus writing on the readins every day...and two of the hardest papers you'll ever have to write.  take this class if you're not taking any others that quarter- and even then- good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: HST209<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is nice and explicit, but assigns entirely too much reading and expects you to know it.  I am a commerce student not history, and I was more stressed about that final than any of my major finals. Avoid her if your not a history major.

I agree that she has a high standard in regards to writing but it's only meant to help us.

She assigns 100's of pages of reading - all to be printed out at your expense. The class is like a kindergarden level and (if you want an A) the papers are graduate level.

She seriously assigns more reading than is possible to do, and is an extremely tough grader. Very few people get A's, and she is unhelpful and unsympathetic outside of class.
