It is a challenging class but it actually breaks down to these components. 1)Math: go on youtube and get a refresher on 'Solving Equations with Variables on Both Sides'. 2)Do all the homeworks. 3)know in class examples.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2014<br>Class Name: IS535<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! I left the class feeling like I really learned something. This class was really challenging but I think it could have been worse if it were taught by someone other than professor Chan.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2013<br>Class Name: IS535<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and very helpful.

Homework due almost every week.  Homeworks are difficult but she goves over the material thoroughly in class.  The midterm and final contain material directly from the homework.  Do the homework, pay attention and you will do well.  Great class, you will learn lots!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2009<br>Class Name: IS425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough course(alot of work), but worth the effort and time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: IS535<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class! One of the most useful classes at DePaul CTI that I ever took.

Extremely tough, but it gets your mind going.  Take this if you want to learn IT Finance, and want a decent challenge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: PM535<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got bigtime indigestion from taking this course.

An expected level of accounting is needed. VERY useless in the real world, as real accountants do this kind of work. Nonstop homework assignments (due every week) which each take at least 3-4 hours to complete, as well as closed-book exams. If I invented a time machine, I would've NEVER taken this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2007<br>Class Name: IS425<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like the class , it was fun and she is really good techer and easy grader .</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2007<br>Class Name: IS425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures drag.  Goes over ppt slides and encourages students to read the chapters.  Good foundation course and she knows her stuff.
