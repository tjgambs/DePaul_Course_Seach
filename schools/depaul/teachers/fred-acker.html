Life is not about making money but if you don't want to be on the street and you want to make a good living in real estate, take this class.  Fred Acker is an amazing asset to DePaul RE dept.  Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2009<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots knock him, but Fred Acker is a great asset to the real estate community.  He puts a refreshing spin on the subject and relates it to real-world experiences.  He's hilarious and dry humored, but he knows his stuff.  Study up, memorize terms, and pay attention, you wil do well.  If you really understand this stuff, you will be successful in RE.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of best Finance professors...perhaps the best speaker I have had DePaul. He has tremendous real-world experience that brings the course to life. If you are interested in real estate, you will learn a ton. Great sense of humor, too!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2008<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is awesome. If you have any interest in building wealth through real estate, you should most definitely take this class. The midterm are a little challenging because there is a lot of information to study, but if you just cram before each of them you'll do just fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2008<br>Class Name: FIN353<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>google &quot;atlantic 3&quot; great experience...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2008<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely one of the worst professors I have had in my college career.  Has no idea what is going on in class and gives you no information about what will be covered on the midterm or final.  He told us we needed to know all the terms and that's all!!!  All he does is talks about his past experiences which really aren't that helpful.  D</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2008<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does not make you sit through his classes. He does not talk about how rich he is, but goes over examples of how people can make money in real estate. If you dont want FREE info that people pay hundreds of dollars to learn stay home and read the book! He went over how to get started with me 1 quarter after I finished the class. EXTREMELY HELPFUL!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2007<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a def jerk. Dosent teach, all he does is tell stupid stories that dont really help you out. His test were really hard. You have to teach yourself, he dosent put any effort to help you either.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2007<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's absent minded. Doesn't take attendence, but if you don't take notes or read the book, you're pretty screwed. He doesn't give homework, so you have to read and learn other real estate concepts on your own. He's not approachable if you don't put effort in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2007<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good guy. He knows his****. If you're an idiot, try not to talk too much. I recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2007<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this class. He has alot of experience and tells interesting stories.  He also gave some good advice.  The final was alot harder than the midterm so do good on the midterm! Its mostly terms. There's also 2 assignments which he just puts a grade with no comments on what you did wrong.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2006<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DUMB!!TEACHER! Relates nothing from what he says to the exam...He claims he has many properties but I thought it was all BS. Waste of my money! He doesnt care about his students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2006<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A dumb story now and again wouldn't be too bad, but when that's all he does for 10 weeks I get annoyed that I wasted my money on this class. Also, he covers NOTHING in class that is on the tests so be ready to read the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man does NOT teach you anything related to what is on his tests.  He pretty much drones on about how clever all of HIS real estate deals have been. He is boring and thinks he's a real estate GOD. I do NOT recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2006<br>Class Name: FIN352<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is hands down the best professor I have ever had. Anyone saying that he doesn't really teach anything is the type of person who only wants to read the book and take a test. He is a real life developer who has unreal amounts of experience.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't really teach - his lectures have nothing to do with the chapters. The tests are strictly from the book so read if you want to pass. Gets annoyed if you come for help. I don't really know why he is teaching...it's not like he needs the money and he doesn't really seem enthusiastic about it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2005<br>Class Name: FINANCE<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fred is not a true &quot;academic.&quot;  I took his class at WSU. If you go talk to him he is full of knowledge and is a master negotiator. You can learn a lot from him if you are willing to pick his brain. At least Fred has experience in what he is talking about...not what he read from a textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2005<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A nice guy, but all he does is sit and talk about how rich he is, he doesn't seem to care that he is teaching a class, and all the homework from the week ahead(chapters that haven't been discussed yet in class) is graded by his TA's, gives a lot of real life examples but doesn't seem to want to do anything else</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2005<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have no idea if this guy has taught before in his life, but he's awful. Doesn't seem to care about the students and is very unhelpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2005<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In my opinion very boring teacher. I do so much better reading the book on my own. It's his first time teaching at Depaul, so maybe he'll get better. Good luck on getting him to grade anything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2005<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof is full of real world examples and tries to draw from his experience to tell you what you really need to know.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy sucks ass really bad and toom uch homework dude!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
