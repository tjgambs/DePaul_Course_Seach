An easy class so long as you follow the readings and videos. There are weekly quizzes, discussions and 2 short papers. Online content is organized interesting and relevant.  Had no problem following along on my own.  Recommend for a Freshman. Also recommend using the Kindle version of the text to aid in quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2012<br>Class Name: ANT360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Mazzeo is a really great professor and he definitely knows his stuff. He is SUPER helpful. Sure, the class is heavy on reading, but its a 300 level designed as a introduction to a grad school course. If you have the chance, take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Mazzeo for Discover Chicago. It was obvious that our class wasn't his top priority, but he is very knowledgable and sparked an interest in anthropology for me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2010<br>Class Name: ANT260<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All we do is go over what we read in the book. You could learn the exact same thing from just reading the books assigned, no need to pay a ton of money listen to a timid, monotone man try to lead a class discussion. I have never met a more boring anthropologist. He made me question my major choice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: ANT320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was awesome.  Our labs were rockin...loved the skulls and going to the zoo.  Mazzeo is a good and nice professor with lots of interesting ideas and knows how to create a fun and enjoyable class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super nice and extremely passionate about his job and anthropology. Made me reconsider changing major. His class was relatively easy and he makes an effort to help you with any problems. Hope to take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2010<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! I would definitely take a class with him again. The work was interesting but not unreasonable, and even non majors i knew enjoyed his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2009<br>Class Name: HEAL110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mazzeo was a pretty cool guy, he was very laid back and quiet, which sometimes led to the class talking over him. He is a semi-easy grader, and as long as you do the work you will get a good grade in his class. If you need help go directly to him and he'll basically give you what you need. I enjoyed him as a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2009<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  Really cares about the subject.  I am a non-major and I loved this class.  His lectures are interesting and the quizzes are easy if you do the readings.  I would definitely recommend him to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: ANT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mazzeo is, simply, an amazing person. He's funny, polite, listens, and has stuff to say in response no matter what you said. His tests are easy if you read, and that shouldn't be a problem as the readings are interesting, even for non-majors. Three 3 page papers that are both fun and easy as pie as they're 3 pages. One of my favorites at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Mazzeo is a really chill and down to earth guy.  His class is based off fun assignments that force you to explore other cultures, hence anthropology. There is not midterm or final. Class discussions were fun and he encouraged participation. The lectures were informative and interesting. Overall it was a great experience</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: ANT320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Mazzeo is one of the reasons that I got into Anthropology and nothing has changed.  The workload is alot but totally worth it in the end.  His class is so interesting and you can tell he loves his subject matter.  Take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2009<br>Class Name: ANT360<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not easy like he used to be!

Nice guy, but things get very boring. Good news is you don't actually have to go to class, and you can still make an A! Material is interesting, so read the homework if you would like to get anything out of the class. He's new. Could improve over time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2007<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Straightforward and interesting class.

Assignments are very intresting and not borning. Encourages participation. He makes the class fun and somehow everyone participates.
