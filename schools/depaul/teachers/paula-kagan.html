There are three popular press books you have to read and write reflections on, a group presentation, and a final paper. She's just really nice all around and just wants you to get interested is all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2008<br>Class Name: HON301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fair teacher.  She cares that you obtain an interest for the class material.  This class was seminar style and we had a lot of good conversations.  A lot of reading but she decreased work load over the quarter upon request.  Interesting books!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2006<br>Class Name: HON300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is a seminar style  class with mandatory participation. Two big papers and two small papers are due; the two bigger ones are challenging. Lots of reading too but can skim readings and still do fine. Kagan makes the class fun. She is fair and genuine. She cares about the student and makes time for them. My favorite teacher at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2005<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Paula is a pretty nice lady, but the info presented was poor at times. It being a science class, I expected something more than junior high basics. We mostly covered social issues, and got off topic a lot because EVERYONE in the class had an opinion. And yes, she DOES keep you the full 3 hours almost every time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Nice! a lot of information in class but tests and assignments not that hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2005<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Paula is pretty cool. Women's health is an easy science credit. The tests are right off the study guide. Class is usually pretty interesting and you never stay for the full 3 hours. Just get the power points and you can zone out in class. Don't buy all the books.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2005<br>Class Name: NSG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>tests are off the powerpoints which can be printed off blackboard.  great teacher and very knowledgeable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2004<br>Class Name: NSG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes the class extremely interesting.
