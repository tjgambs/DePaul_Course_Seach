Why I came to DePaul's entrepreneurship program. Learn enterprise concepts taught around the world from the DePaul professor who created them and apply them in a team consulting project. He opens his network to students and is always available. No wonder he won both teaching awards at graduation.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2015<br>Class Name: MGT595<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Rather not say</div><div id="right"><div>Very good class with a lot of learning to be gained. You will be be a part of a team to help grow a social venture that requires help. It will require a lot of work and motivation but I can guarantee you this "It will be worth it". Prof. Patrick will help your team along the way if you need him. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2014<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Like everyone's said Prof. Murphy is very knowledgeable and truly cares about his students. He's a great teacher for the business capstone- you really put everything you've learned to good use. Recommend being a team lead for the project (lots of work but guaranteed an A plus excellent experience). Wish he taught more classes. Awesome prof overall!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2014<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Murphy is one of the most inspirational and motivating professors I have ever had. His contagious energy and encouragement makes it easier for the students to get involved. Professor believes in real world experience, so expect impressive guest speakers and fun outdoor exercises.  A remarkable human being. Highly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2014<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Murphy is the Michael Jordan of professors plain and simple. I've had two classes with him at DePaul and both have been my favorite classes in my time here. If you want to be inspired, actually learn, and enjoy a hilarious class in the process well then you need to take a class with him. Murphy is THE MAN!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>The grade consists of a midterm and a project. The midterm- he didn't grade and decided to give everyone an A. The project- as long as you do it, put some effort into it, and don't anger your team lead (since the team lead grades you), then you'll pass with an A. Just show up and look interested.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was without a doubt the best class I have taken at depaul. Professor Murphy is incredibly smart & passionate about learning. Wish I hadn't waited until my last year at depaul to take him because I would have taken all of his classes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this class its super! While it is challenging you will be glad you did. Most of the class is providing help to the entrepreneurs. Don't buy the book! If you are outgoing and well organized be a team lead. They have to do a bit more work but it will be rewarding. Take him you won't regret it. Only one test and its easy and a Final presentation.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2013<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is by far the coolest professor at DePaul. You learn a lot, get tons of hands on experience, and have a good time while doing it. My only regret is that I didn't take his classes before I was a senior!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I've ever had, hands down. Knows what he's talking about, dresses nice, experienced, energetic, funny, and very smart. There's a lot of work to be done in this class but it may be the most helpful one you ever take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Listen DePaul Students: if you want to take a class worth the money you are paying for.. then take Murphy. I can write an essay illustrating how good this class is but I can sum it up with BRILLIANT. I was a Group Manager and it wasn't an easy job at all, but it was definitely a pleasant experience that i will carry on to talk a bout for years..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Murphy was such a pleasure. You can tell he loved teaching, and I learned so much from him. His class is challenging and forces you to learn, but he's really helpful. He's also very encouraging to his students. I felt that this class helped to prepare me the most for the real world. Awesome class! TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the best professor at DePaul, and also best dressed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Murphy is the bomb. He is an amazing teacher, I was scared the first day because the course seemed really demanding, but I am SO GLAD that I stuck it out. The midterm is hard so study! Other than that the class is awesome, you do a huge group project but he makes it fun and extremely useful. TAKE HIM you're life will be better for it!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Murphy is a credit to his profession.  Many professors at DePaul are mediocre at best.  Murphy is a great teacher.  He is professional, well dressed, upbeat, and well traveled.  Class time flies, and he actually teaches.  The group project was intense, but fun.  Watch out for his exams. Questions are tricky with more than one right answer.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2009<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is by far one of the best teachers at DePaul. I think every teacher who has a bad rating on here, should go and learn something from Mr. Murphy. Do not think that this is a blow off class, because it isn't. You learn in many different ways. He is very accessible and wants his students to succeed!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simply amazing. Murphy is one-of-a-kind teacher who loves to be around people and has one of the greatest minds at DePaul.  Do yourself a favor and attend his class.  The actual work for this class is time consuming and requires literally a daily commitment, but Murphy is there to help you every step of the way.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class. For sure sign up to be a manager it will give you lots of experience that you can't find in another class. Professor Murphy really tries to give his students as much experience as possible and you will really enjoy going to class everyday!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2008<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Murphy is good at solving issues with the clients. Take ICS 394 and go to him for help as much as you can.  I saw how to start a business venture from my client and learned how to do it right from class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2008<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've never had a class that was so active and unique while remaining challenging and thought provoking.  Very engaging professor. The best group dynamic ever in a class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Murphy is well dressed and always enthusiastic.  He really wants everyone to work together and learn as a group, not just as individuals.  The class is easy if you pay attention.  You're graded on attendance, midterm, final, and project.  Each are worth 25%.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very entertaining professor. Funny and class time flies by fast with this one. It can be a lot of work, but its worth it because you might use it in the future. Midterm and Final isn't too hard , you just need to think &quot;into&quot; the venture and seperate parts and explain it. Smart professor too!-Wish there was more of him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great professor. Made the class very fun and exciting. You learn a lot in this class about managerial concepts and how to think. The midterm and final was really hard, but you make up for it with the project and participation grade. Strongly recommended. He got to be one of the top at Depaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Classes put knowledge in your brain with the target managers plus text book, and ideas are approached from different angles. more than memorization.  his project is the best ever but intense because he forces professional and not student level - great for interviews. exams are graded very fast and Bb is a big part. strongly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what everyone is so impressed about. The lectures are interesting and fun but the project is the part where you learn the most. The mid-term was a complete shock for almost everyone because the concepts were never presented in the same manner as they were presented on the test. Overall, an okay class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2008<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Murphy is an asset to DePaul B-School. He knows his stuff and is a great person for advice if you have any questions about the class or jobs, etc. His class is more work than others but the amount you learn makes it worth it. I've taken two of his classes and don't regret the extra work because I actually learned something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2007<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exciting and Challenging course.

Hes really tries to innovate and excite students about mgt which shows his passion for the subject.  Always a fun and amusing class and would recommend him to everyone! We had barly any hw and a mid. and fin. photo hunt.  Unique and fun idea however he didn't put much time into grading it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>PPJM is easily one of the top three professors, if not the top, at DePaul's B-School. His lectures are entertaining, clear and with pure substance that is relevant to the subject matter. It's no wonder the Entrepreneurship program is ranked high when you have a prof. who is as engaging as he is. Challenging but not overhauling. Recommend to all!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent night class, he made management fascinating and is extremely talented.  What I did not love in our class was a few disrespectful students. He teaches so well. You can learn many practical ideas for your job. He wanted a test and project but class voted for photo journals+presentations. I wish we would have done a project report.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Someone should explain to this guy that he's not teaching in liberal arts dept.No mdt& final, just took pics of mgt terms.If I want to learn how to take pics, I will take Photo 101.He graded everyone the same no matter how much effort you put it.Easy for slackers, VERY FRUSTRATING for people who actually DO the work. What a waste of time & money!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NO I dissagree and I was so disappointed with my TH night class. Yeah I get it, hes cute, quirky... whatever, but all he cares about his getting it into the Tribune and that other people think he is &quot;innovative.&quot; I see right through him and I think he is a phony. I learned NOTHING about MGT in this class just learned how to waste my time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the comment below. If you have the chance to take him, definitely take him. I had so much fun in his Thursday night class... a class I actually looked forward too... and it was a NIGHT CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have a chance to take PJM and u don't&#63; You don't deserve to live.

JUST ATTEND CLASS AND PAY ATTENTION TO LECTURE, & TAKE NOTES. I GOT AN A & HARDLY USED BOOK. THIS PROF. IS THE BEST @DEPAUL. LEARNED A LOT. PROJECT IS LONG BUT VERY USEFUL TO REAL LIFE!

He takes things very seriously, and makes the class very entertaing. You have to READ the book. Lectures are okay. Two exams, and one big project. His exams are hard, but if you read you will pull off a B or A. He really makes you think about different situations.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Murphy made class very interesting. The midterm was very hard but the final was really easy. The main part of the class is the group project which is a pain if you have slackers in your group. Although if you talk to the professor and make it known that you are putting a lot into the project he will look highly upon it and grade you easier.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2007<br>Class Name: MPS500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've ever had. If you don't get along with Dr. Murphy it's because you don't listen to his suggestions and/or can't write. So knowledgeable, helpful if you see him, and a great leader for MPS.

By far one of the best profs I have had at DePaul. The class is great, although you should be aware that his midterm (wake up) exam is slightly challenging.

He turn the classroom into a real organization.  The class itself does not require a lot of work, if you are not a project manager.

He's also really easy on the eyes in a dorkycute sort of way. The exams seem difficult while taking them, but he curves them A LOT. I learned a lot and the project was a worthwhile and different experience. You should definitely take him even if the class is at 8:30 in the morning!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>absolutely hilarious!!! ahh i cant stress that enough!  i used information from his lectures in my interviews and got impressive responses. one of the few classes ive gone to where i wanted to learn. Turns the classroom into a big family and goes out of his way to make sure you are getting the most out of his class. Definitely recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most fun I have ever had in a class ever. He is the funnest prof in the U.S. he is very knowledgeable and helps you for everything. You wont want to miss his class because it is so fun.

If you post something on Bb or send him an email, he'll probably get back to you within an hour (unless it's like 3 AM). If you're having problems in his class, go talk to him, and he'll fix them. Watch out though!

He is professional, ethical, and really cool at the same time. He brings real-world experience and the case study to class.
