Her lectures sucked and the material on the test was in no way what she went over in class. Maybe if she explained things more the class would have been better but she really needs to learn to give study guides for tests because me and several other classmates were very confused.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2010<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an awesome teacher! You use an i-clicker and she ananoymously tests everyones comprehension so that she can know whether or not to move onto new material or reinforce what was just taught. Amazingly sweet! Deffinately reccommend this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2009<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a wonderful professor. If you go to class and pay attention, you will never need the book. I didn't open it once and got an easy A. Her tests are very straightforward but require a little studying. Lab is very easy. Easy A, nice teacher, learn a lot -- can't beat it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is my 4th year at DePaul and she is the best teacher I have taken. She cares about her students, and wants them to do well. She is willing to take the extra time to help. Her tests can be a little tricky but she gives you a chance to defend your answers. A very nice person and great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2009<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's pretty cool, but talks very fast. She grades fairly easy and her lectures are somewhat interesting. She also gives you 20 of the exam questions with the answers before the test so I think that is pretty fair and easy. Attend lecture, read the chapters, and you should do fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher... lab was easy.. curved midterms.. extra credit for going to class.. wanted student to do well... plenty of opportunities for help.. take her if you have the chance!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This focal point class is pretty interesting, and Prof Bramble is so so nice! I would recommend her if your interested in nature or ecology. You have to turn in 1 pg reading assignments every class, 1 big group final project and paper. no studying, no tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!!!  Had so much fun even though i really wasn't serious about class at first.  Take it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: ISP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so nice and helpful, take her she is easy, but you do have to do some work. If your a freshman looking for a focal point take her she is easy and very helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2006<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bramble is really awesome. Her lab is the easiest biology lab i've ever taken and its really laid back. Going to class defenitly helps because even though you can print off slides, she says extra info that wil help you on the tests. Have to study for tests for sure but she's really helpful and explains everything pretty clearly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2006<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>her lectures are pretty lame because she talks the ENTIRE time, but def take her for labs. she was so great and personable. she has been the nicest teacher i've had at depaul thus far. she really cares how her students do and does everything in her power to get them to succeed. i highly recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have the opportunity to take her ecology focal point, do it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor, her tests are very focused which means if you do not know that material your screwed.  Other then that its a &quot;ok&quot; class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bramble is an amazing teacher. I just hate ecology. I don't understand it however she was very helpful in attempting to make me understand. Labs are so easy it is insane. They really help your grade though. I would take her again, if the subject wasn't ecology.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bramble is a really great, organized teacher. Although I didn't find the subject particularly interesting, she is extremely knowledgeable, and does NOT read right of lecture notes, which is a nice change! Take her if you get a chance!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2005<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice, extremely knowledgeable, and cares about her students. Some of the questions on her tests however, are worded very poorly or have multiple answers and only one is programmed into the scan tron. If you aced the verbal part of the SATâ€™s take her, if not, you have to take her anyway because she is the only one that teaches this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is sooo nice and labs are sometimes fun (gasp)!  Go to lecture and take notes.  She ties Ecology into current issues, like overpopulation, food shortages, etc.  Take her...she is nice and fairly interesting...a good mix!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2005<br>Class Name: ECOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The tests were a bit hard.  As long as you take good notes and refer to her lecture outlines before the tests, you can easily get an A. Unless you want to get all hardcore about it, you don't need the book.  The tests don't deviate much from what she covers in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2004<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought this class was boring. She is a nice lady, and her tests are multiple choice. If you pay attention in class you'll be ok.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2004<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Bramble is awesome  - she knows SO much about what shes teaching, and is so helpful... always wants to know what the class feels about what were doing, throws out questions that no one gets.  Tests are a tiny bit challenging, and if you understand whats covered in lecture you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2004<br>Class Name: BIO1013<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I've ever had. Extremely knowledgeable, always willing to help you out. If she teaches a class you need to take, pick her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2004<br>Class Name: BIOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OHHHH my god!!!!
