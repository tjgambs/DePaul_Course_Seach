He lays down the law of the classroom and it all seems very intimidating, and don't get me wrong it is a lot of work right off the bat. But he is a wonderful person and I was hooked on every word he said! HE IS PHENOMENAL. Harvard grad and super knowledgeable with a quirky but awesome sense of humor. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2013<br>Class Name: HST221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By in far one of the greatest professors I've had at DePaul.

I wish I could take Dr. Boeck for all of my classes. It is not an easy A and he demands a lot of reading. Take good notes bc you get to use them on the exams. Made subject very interesting.

Historiography based class and Dr. Boeck made it enjoyable. Hard content and workload, but 100% worth it. One of the top 5 professors at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2011<br>Class Name: HSTLOTS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Boeck was my advisor and I'm extremely happy to hear he received tenure. He is a very knowledgeable teacher, a kind personality, and an able steward of students. Perhaps non-history majors should avoid him, but they're missing out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2010<br>Class Name: HIST101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very unorganized!!

Participation is important. He's very concerned in assessing his students so be prepared for each class and have assignments ready. However, he's very helpful and understanding. You just have to talk to him and let him know what's up. I was able to get a B+!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2009<br>Class Name: HST298<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome guy, very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: HST172<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Even though I had him at 8:30 in the morning the class was thoroughly entertaining. The subject matter was very interesting. Very knowledge and approachable. He lets you use notes on the midterm and the final exam. Gives good feedback on research paper assignment, recommended professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: HST172<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Boeck is very intelligent and very witty. You won't be able to get anything by him. I definitely reccomend him if you need to knock out a U.P. requirement. One tip: He lets you use notes on tests. When making notes focus on details like names, dates, etc. You may cover two dozen things but the test will test you harshly on like 5 things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2008<br>Class Name: HST172<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Boeck is one of the most knowledgable history professor I know. Yes he lectures a lot, but even though I have no interest in history he made the class really interesting.The notes you take from the lecture nearly always find themselves in the midterm as well as the final which makes the class much more doable.Great professor, highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2008<br>Class Name: HIST101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. B is a very difficult teacher. Dont be fooled by jokes and interesting lectures. Try missing one assignment or even coming in late, he wont say a word, he will silently destroy your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2008<br>Class Name: HIST211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful teacher. I had no interest whatsoever on the subject. It turned out to be my favorite class of the quarter. He is crystal clear and makes it so easy to follow! Tests are open notes but I recommend you look over the book and jot down some notes to make sure you get an A+. Take him, you wont regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2008<br>Class Name: HST219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher, GREAT lecturer.  So easy to understand, and so easy to take notes on.  I got an A+ in the class.  It wasn't easy but his awesome lectures didn't make it that difficult, either.  His dry humor is the best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: HST219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Boeck is an awesome prof!  He is very nice and understanding, extremely knowledgeable (seriously, this guy knows everything about history), and very funny (in a dry, academically-witty sort of way).  Take him...you'll learn a ton.  Plus, open note tests and lots of extra credit opportunities!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2007<br>Class Name: HST000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WONDERFUL professor. If you are looking for a challenge, take him. You'll get your money's worth for the class. He is sooo intelligent, and the way he lectures is so interesting. I was always on the edge of my seat. My favorite professor thus far @ DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2007<br>Class Name: HIST211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's o.k. totally not true about make-up exams!

He's extremely knowledgeable about history and also very helpful. I emailed him months after taking his class to see if he could recommend any books for a paper I was writing and he replied with a list right away. He's also very funny if you pay attention to him. Be sure to take lots of notes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/08/2007<br>Class Name: HIST211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this guy! Think hes totally great! He knows what hes talking about and its very refreshing. Lectures can be a little boring if ur not really interested in the topic but its a good class to take. Pretty easy grader AND he lets you use notes on the tests, which is a HUGE plus, I know thats what saved me on the final.Papers are pretty easy too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2007<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The other reviews don't lie-- take meticulous notes. Exams are open-note and require lots of detail in your answers. Initially you will be bored but by the end come to realize it is quite different from other HST courses in that you learn the small ends of the stuff you thought you knew already. Participation & attendance impact your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2007<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is one of the more knowledgeable history teachers i've ever seen TAKE NOTES it'll definitely help you in the exams, pay attention and go to class! you can use your notes during exams!!! kind of a hard grader, but he puts a lot in lectures and expects a bit back! tons of boring reading, but still a good teacher overall</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: HST221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So intense, he translated some documents we used in class. great teacher, take notes on EVERY lecture. Great teacher, youll learn lots. hes very scholarly, soft spoken, and funny if you catch his jokes. take him, hes not easy but its worth it. my only gripe is the readings he chose were incredibly boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2007<br>Class Name: HST221<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy, cute sense of humor. Knows what he's talking about. You must be on time and go to most classes or grade will suffer. Don't fall asleep or he'll kick you out of class. Not much homework, just lots of lectures and TONS of notes. I was bored but he was a great guy and I recommend him if you have to take a history course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2007<br>Class Name: HST219<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy teacher if you do everything, on midterm you can use notes that you hand-wrote in class - so try to take as many notes as possible, and also when reading text book or handouts take some notes as well - they might come handy on the midterm, final is take home.  and show up on time to class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2006<br>Class Name: HST701<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not really an easy professor, but he is awesome!!

His lectures were very informative and it is wise to take lots of notes, as they WILL be helpful (hint: Final). Turn off your cellphones, otherwise you will be kicked out of class. Dr. Boeck puts a lot into his lectures and expects a lot back. He notices everything that is going on in class, so keep that in mind. -Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: HIST211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher, awesome class.  His lectures are very interesting and the guy is a riot!  I got an A in the class, and all I did was just go to class and pay attention.  He doesn't grade the weekly assignments, just looks for you to hand it in.  Mid-Term is open notes, and Finals is take home... Those who failed his class must be complete morons!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: HIST211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Smart professor....but BEWARE, he is no joke..VERY VERY VERY HARD grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2006<br>Class Name: HST219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very good at lecturing and keeping student's interest intact. But he is a very tough grader. So study notes like crazy! Don't miss class/hw. If you talk in class, it might help. Overall, I think he's a great guy w/his earth tones suits. Very smart (Harvard) & married to Mrs. Boeck at DePaul. If u r ready to work hard, then u gotta take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2006<br>Class Name: HST312<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed the class, and I learned a lot from his class.

Someone take him up on his offer of going for coffee!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of notes,non-stop writing for the whole period. but take good notes because the midterm and final are open note.he says you don't need to know dates,but they help on the midterm and final.the difference is w/o dates you get a&quot;C&quot;with notes its possible to get an&quot;A&quot;he uses cheap books,i think the text was &lt;$20.read to get an &quot;A.&quot; learned a lot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>go to class and write everything down. the tests are easy -- the day before tests he outlines what to study. you can get by w/o reading. the paper is the hardest part -- email it to him and he'll give you alot of help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I urge you to go into his office to talk to him.  He is extremely helpful and willing to talk.  His lectures are so interesting.  He is pretty demanding with the writing, but if you have half a bloody brain, you'll do fine.  Boeck's great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of discussion, and pretty easy reading. Thoughtful - cheap books. Interesting approach to history, long papers, open note tests  would totally recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: HISTORY211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Boeck is awesome!  Even though there is a lot of reading, the class is fun.  He is very well organized and he is very helpful. I recommend you take this class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: HIST211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Brian Boeck hmmmmm! Very good, full of knowledge. Highly recommended to those who really want to learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Boeck is a tough teacher but perhaps one of the best teachers that i've had here at depaul. He is very smart and expects students to read the assigned assignments. I would recommend this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2005<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy really knows his stuff, but he's very nice and a not impossibly difficult grader.  If you go and see him about your papers and exams, he definitely will help you out.  He's probably the most intelligent person I've ever met.  take him if you can, he's great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2005<br>Class Name: HIST<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arrogant.  Pure and simple. Hard grader, much more than a 200 level class should be.  Gives very little to no direction for assignments, then slams you when you didn't write what he expected. Yeah, he knows his stuff, but c'mon, I'm here to learn, not have him prove what he knows.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2004<br>Class Name: HST320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Because this was a 300 level class it was hard...a lot of reading everyday, seemed like every hour. Professor meant well and extremely knowledgable..but a hard grader. we are not harvard students sorry...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2004<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely informed and knowledgeable, Dr. Boeck presents his lectures in a standard lecture-note taking format. Outlines papers, projects, readings very clearly. Very nice, understanding guy. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2004<br>Class Name: HST320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable, he expects a lot from students but he works hard for classes and he's very fair, will take student concerns underconsideration and change the workload if necessary, can be a little dry at times</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You have to give Boeck credit, he knows his ish. Very smart guy, a Harvard graduate so he expects a lot. When I payed attention I learned a thing or two, but he lectures right at you with no interaction. Young guy, but he's kind of monotonous so you better like the subject you are learning about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2004<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was relatively easy as long as you did the weekly assignments and participated.  He's a great professor and really knows his stuff-- if you can read a couple of pages a week and write a couple of pages a week, you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2004<br>Class Name: HST320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher, it's history people, you shouldn't expect to sit there and do nothing. Of course you are going to read and have papers, it's college! He's very knowledgable, and we always had great class discussions, I'd recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very difficult class extremly hard grader.

His assignments have vague directions.
