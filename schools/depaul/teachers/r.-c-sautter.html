Honestly. He's very understanding. In-class discussions with him were both entertaining and very informative. Class field trips were relevant and fun. Boss by Mike Royko played almost no role in the class, and it's just as well since I didn't read it. Gave me a passing grade even though I didn't do any of the assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: PHI2604<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor, class was very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material itself is fairly interesting: Chicago Politics, Bosses and Reformers. Classes are basically discussions, variety of topics are discussed. The professor is incredibly intelligent, having written 10 books and is teaching philosophy and creative writing. He's really cool and understanding. Definitely recommend taking him forExplr.Chicago.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: FA379<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was one of the best profs I have ever had.  He kept the class very interested and encouraged dialogue.  He is very knowledgable on American history and has written 10 books.  I look forward to taking another class with him soon.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
