If you have him just drop him. Worst accounting professor. If you don't believe me look at the reviews of him lower from about 2004 or 2005. Let me let you nothing has changed. He is still the same bad professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: 350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whatever you do not take him. He is the worst professor in the accounting school. He picks apart presentations. He grades like an English teacher. Both midterm and final are straight memorization. He will ask you to write definition down from the notes word for word. My suggestion is that if you can take another teacher. Drop the class if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2015<br>Class Name: 640<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Won't curve.

I thought he was just plain mean and wanted to show off how much he knew. Now that I look back, the class was extremely helpful. He will push you, but you will come out with so much knowledge. Its a bunch of work, but definitely worth it. He's not a mean guy, he just wants students to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2012<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!

He will lower your grade for any little thing. For example, do not write &quot;realized/ realizable&quot; but he wants &quot;realized OR realizable.&quot; Yea, he's that picky. Hard class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2010<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not bad, the only bad thing was my horrible, irresponsible, and undependable group which left me stuck doing all the work alone!  You do a lot of research (its a research class!) that will help you with the research portion of the CPA.  He is very helpful and always PROMPTLY responded to my emails/questions. Memorize n you'll b ok :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is class is not as bad as people make it seem like. The material is pretty simple, it is just basically memorization. I took this over the summer and worked fulltime at the same time and still got an A. Memorize the parts of the notes that list things word for word, the Qs from the slides are nore general, and the articles you need to know.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor, the class is very interesting though requires you to put a lot of work and effort into it, but what would you expect it is an accounting class after all! Final is easier than the midterm for sure, so don't drop it after first five weeks!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy will fail you in a second. The mid and final are literally word for word from the notes.. you have to memorize them! The highest grade you can get is a 97% even if perfect. He will punch holes in everything you do and lower ur grade... there is no other choice for this class.. pray to pass! 3/4 of my class were taking for the 2nd time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.

Does not like anything less than perfect. He edits each and every sentence of anything you turn in. Many assignments and most are group-work. Assignments are tough but exams are mostly memorization.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>5 group presentation, 3 individual, 4 written group assign, midterm and final all in 10 wks. Each asign will take you 20hrs. He grades HARD with no curve. Feels there are no perfect scores. Class avg was 66% no curve. If the quarter was longer this class might be possible. He is the ONLY teacher for this class - WE ARE SCREWED!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2009<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the worst teacher EVERRRR!! the class midterm avg was around 50 and he didnt even curve...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2009<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No doubt Alford class is difficult, but those that do not think they can pass or get a decent grade are crazy.

His tests are extremely difficult.  You never know what to expect.  You literally have to know everything about your homework and class discussions.  He is fair if you come to class every time.  He is helpful but the class consumed my life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor...one of best Accounting teachers FOR SURE! Teaches material very helpful for the real-world.

He asks nothing but CPA questions. I'm surprised he didn't ask us to study out of a CPA bank, because had he done that, I probably would have ended up with an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2008<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests are hard, so study your notes carefully.

Very clear and detailed explanations. Pop quizzes, usually once a week, but they are not difficult;will definitely do well with brief review of class notes. Midterm and final-somewhat challenging, but not very difficult with some studying. Gives homework for practice, but does not collect it. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2007<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was Okay, BUT the midterm was a joke.

Take this teacher if you're a visual learner because he writes his notes on the board.  Tests (2) are difficult.  He has pop quizzes,  don't be late to class!  Otherwise he won't let you take it.  2 spreadsheet assignments which is very time-consuming, but help a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most challenging Accounting professors I've had.

EXTREMELY difficult tests and go way beyond what he teaches in class. He is a fair grader but you must study REALLY hard for an A.

Explains the material well & is organized. The midterm & final were very hard, but it all depends on how much time and effort u wanna put into studying.

Take good notes it will prepare you for the midterm, final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy has PMS.

His grading is not difficult and very fair.  His tests are open book and open notes, but extremely difficult.  Students that go into the final and midterm without studying will not do well.

Alford is probably the best accounting professor I had out of six classes.  He is extremely clear and will help you out when ever you need it.  Before the final exam he even had a special study session and stayed for 3 hrs (even when there were only a few students.)  Not very easy, but you'll learn alot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher. He is a black spot for Depaul, especially graduate level course. He is not fit to teach any course. His exams are horrible and he talks one thing and does completely opposite. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.

I wanted to cry my eyes out after both the midterm and final. He knocked some people out of the honors program.  Soooooo ****ing hard. Tests are IMPOSSIBLE!!! I hope he isn't teaching anymore.

He is a conceptual thinker and wants you to think of the big picture and not just on formulas.
