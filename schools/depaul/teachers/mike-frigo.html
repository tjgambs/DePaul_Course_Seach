Mike is a great guy and the course content is beneficial to anyone interest in opening a business or being financially responsible. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: MPS515<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mike was one of the better professors I had in SPS!  I enjoyed his class, and came out knowing more than when I began.  I kind of wished that the course had been a little bit more difficult.  However, I know the background knowledge and skill level of the students coming into the class was quite varied.  Overall, I recommend his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: MPS515<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is an easy "A" class if you just show up to class and work hard on the midterm and final. Mike is REALLY helpful outside of class. However, you'll definitely learn more from the textbook than the actual class. He does talk about his work and family A LOT. Homework assignments are easy. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2014<br>Class Name: MPS515<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Frigo liked to talk about personal and work matters in class. I could have studied the info on my own for a much better use of time. This class was worthless.</div></div></div></body></html>
