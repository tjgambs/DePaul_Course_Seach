Funny, nice and helpful person too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the best profs in DePaul!

Considering the dry topic, she did an awesome job teaching the necessary concepts to the class. I learned a lot, esp. about sentence format and structure and how to vary them. She's also very kind, very intelligent, and just so happens to be quite cute in an understated, bookish way that this student thinks is HOT.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: ENG377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>there is a lot of busy work,but she's really really nice and chill. the fun seems scary at first but its an easy alternative to an actual internship</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: ENG377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class i took was junior year experiential learning, where we had community service to fulfill.  There is a lot of writing activites and homework.  There is probably a single spaced page of writing every week.  But the class in general is easy.  And as long as everything is complete, you'll get an A.  She is very helpful, and will bend the rules</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2005<br>Class Name: GRAMMAR<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What teacher doesn't show for the first day of class b/c of a vacation&#63;! Prof Tardy does, and that's exactly the kind of laid-back gal she is. Very flexible and understanding, even when you're gone for 1/2 of the class b.s-ing in spring! Do your work and know what you're talking about, and she's as sweet as pie.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2005<br>Class Name: ENG203GRAMMAR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I disagree with the previous comments about her.  Her class is very easy. Her homeworks are very managable.  She knows a lot about grammar and she has fun teaching it, too!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Tardy is kind of young. She definitely knows Grammar and English. Her assignments are not easy, but at the same time, they are not hard. The class is not an easy &quot;A.&quot; You really have to work for it esp when it comes to this called Grammar. She is really helpful though and always is available for assistance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT teacher!!!  Definately not a blow-off class but it is amazingly very interesting with her as the teacher.... highly recommended!! :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2005<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to take a good English 309 class, take it with professor Trady!  She is so sweet and always smiling; her attitude helps a great deal! Also, she will work but you will not regret it! She makes class so much fun you don't even realize that you did so much work!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
