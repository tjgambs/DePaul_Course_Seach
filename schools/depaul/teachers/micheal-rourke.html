Great teacher burdened with a not great class. He makes it bareable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2011<br>Class Name: THE143<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rourke expects you to work hard and contribute, but he also is there if you have any questions and responds to emails fast. Don't let the other reviews scare you. He is great at what he does.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: THE142<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He lectures from notes that he has had since the 1980's, so he is way out of date. He goes off on hour long tangents in the middle of class, and has no clarity through his lectures. He is difficult to approach and unwilling to answer questions. He sets you up to fail on tests and assignments.  Stay away from this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: LIGHTINGTECH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher!  Great Class!  Just very hard.  You have to do a lot of work and learn a lot of information.  The class should really be divided up.  There isn't enough time for all of it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2004<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a horrible and arrogant professor. He expects everyone to know what he knows about theatre and if you don't he treats you like an idiot. He teaches this 100 level class like a 300 level class and gives a pop quizzes to set you up to fail. Stay away unless your ready to do some uneccessary work</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
