She is really clear and will answer any and all questions that you ask. Too bad I do not have any more requirements with her. She is by far the best programming teacher at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2012<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really easy course.  During the quarter, you only have to pass/fail some easy hw/quizzes, and your grade is dependent on the midterm/final.  Sounds scary, but almost everyone got an A on the midterm at least.  She's really helpful and a little scatterbrained, never a bad thing in a prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2012<br>Class Name: CSC262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Heart is a great teacher who is very down to earth and crystal clear. Not one person in the class had anything bad to say about her. Try to get her if you can</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2011<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher, clear and very helpful. I took this class before with a different teacher and thought it was impossible to learn c++, but she did it. Great grading system</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2011<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher. Encouraged students' engagement in class, made it a very safe environment for them to inquire or discuss the course material. Very informed about the programming field, assignments were clear, she quickly responded to any questions I had with a clear answer. I wish I could take more classes with her.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
