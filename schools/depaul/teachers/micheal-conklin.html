He is a really nice guy who knows his stuff. I would reccommend him :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: JOUR279<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best profs I've ever had. He knows the industry really well and has a practical approach to teaching. he is very encouraging and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: JOUR377<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Didn't think he graded very fairly.  Pretty much just talked and had speakers come in.  Didn't really do much actual teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2009<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is wacky and unorganized. But he is a funny guy and knows alot about his topics. He tends to go on long tagents about nothing because he likes to hear the sound of his own voice. He is a good teacher. Just turn in your work on time and you are guarnteed at least a B. Also usually lets you out early if no one interupts. Overall good teache</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2009<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy...very fun and makes great jokes. Actually learned a lot. However, he is vague about the assignments and about what he wants and doesn't exactly help you, so you can't exactly predict your grade. Not the fairest grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2009<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Conklin is a nice guy but takes a Discover class way too seriously.  It can be difficult to do well in this class.  He is also unorganized which makes the class, especially immersion week, annoying.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Conk for my Discover Chicago class. Topic was &quot;In the Loop&quot; and he actually took us to cool places. I got very acquainted with the city and campus thanks to him. I also think it's adorable that he reminds me of the &quot;inconceivable!&quot; guy from the princess bride. great experience, great understanding. great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Conklin has so much experience in his field. I don't understand how someone could say his stories from when he worked at the Tribune could be a bad thing. Would you want a teacher with first-hand experience in the field you're planning on working in&#63; He also has a great sense of humor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting and knowledgeable guy, but the class was not planned well and was very boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2008<br>Class Name: CMN275<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He usually speaks only about himself, in a monotone and  difficult to hear voice.  More importantly, however, he does not give specific criteria for the class or homework. It's hit or miss.  And, when asked for help or clarification, he was particularly short and condescending.  NOT HELPFUL. DO NOT RECOMMEND- ESPECIALLY FOR NIGHT CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2008<br>Class Name: CMN279<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not have wanted to take CMN 275 with any other professor and I have been trying to get him for other classes. His experience is untouchable and he is genuinely interested in his students and their well being. He also has a very subtle humor and wit which was hilarious to me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2007<br>Class Name: CMN279<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I find it interesting that the student below me had the courage to say anything bad about Professor Conklin and another professor when she attended 4 classes in total. I loved this class, and Professor Conklin helped me land an internship at the Chicago Tribune. He is a great man!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2007<br>Class Name: CMN279<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, he'll tell you stuff that'll be useful if you want to be a journalist, he knows people in the business(aka he's good to know), and he'll help you any way he can. But- he could be a better teacher, go more in depth on how he likes things written, etc. Also,tends to tell the same stories over and over again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: CMN275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful professor---his experience in journalism is something that cannot be taught by a textbook.  Great class, great teacher, I learned alot and he was extremely willing to help outside of class. Definitely recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: CMN275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the most interesting professor I've taken at DePaul.  He is also a very kind man and willing to help students a great deal more than the typical professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2006<br>Class Name: FEATUREWRITING<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice guy, but tends to ramble on about nothing for most of the class. His grading system is inconsistent and frustrating. Don't buy the book, they have nothing to do with the assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2006<br>Class Name: FEATUREWRITING<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Taking a class with him is like taking a class with your grandfather. True, he has a lot of expierience, but how are his stories about what he did at the tribune supposed to help you improve your writing&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2006<br>Class Name: FEATUREWRITING<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really passionate about the topic, and has a lot of experience in writing feature stories.  Really expects a lot out of students!  Treats assignments as if they were things being done for a real job!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: COM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
