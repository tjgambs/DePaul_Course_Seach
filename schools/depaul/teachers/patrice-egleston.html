I could go on and on and acclaim her teaching, what she does and how and how wonderful it is, but the main point is, I'm an Acting major and the work she taught me and the way she taught it, made me a better actor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: MOVEMENT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's not particularly insightful or productive in her teaching style.  Pretty much she'll have you roll around for an hour and say &quot;So how do you feel about that&#63;&quot;  I don't feel like I learned anything practical.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2005<br>Class Name: MOVEMENT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Completely knows her stuff, a wonderfully intutive and sensitive professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2004<br>Class Name: MOVEMENT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is NOT helpful at all. Her class makes you count down until it's over. She's often late and has lame excuses for it, but after you bug her to death to ask about your progress is she willing to help. DO TAKE, though us TTS ppl have no choice! Good Luck</div></div></div></body></html>
