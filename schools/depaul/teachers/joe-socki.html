The tests were open note and there is one extra credit opportunity. The class could be interesting but he always cut the lights off and his voice was very soothing so it can sometimes make you sleepy. Overall, he is a really nice just a tad boring</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2015<br>Class Name: HAA263<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Socki is a nice guy, the class can be pretty boring. The whole class is lectures, he expects you to take notes here and there. Tests are very hard but he gives you a sheet of paper notecard. Readings (x3) and responses due every week, responses are one page, single spaced. Textbook is important.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2015<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe Socki is a nice guy who really knows what he's talking about.

Very clear. The tests aren't hard at all memorization in required though</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class. Professor Socki really knows what he's talking about. You take field trips almost every class and get out early on most days. participation is 50% of your grade and the other half is just 4 papers. easy enough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Socki is great professor he knows what he's talking about and is a really nice guy. If you show up to class every day and do the work you will get easily get an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: HAA240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was never into art until after this class. Text book is mandatory and there is a short paper due at each class, but it keeps you on top of readings and understanding. Clear lectures and he has a passion for what is being taught. Final and midterm straightforward, if you come prepared there is no difficulty. Highly recommended! Great professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this may be the most boring class of all time.. no class interaction- he talks the whole time. exams are straight memorization with minor concepts. grades papers like it's an eight grade class. overall, bring coffee, or u can sleep like I did and still get a B</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe's the BEST! He is very kind, helpful, and clear, and extremely knowledgeable. Anyone who claims his class is hard has serious issues, because it's one of the easiest I've taken. At the same time, though, it's one of the most enlightening. My one recommendation is to not take it as a night class, because you will fall asleep. Anyway, TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome and very knowledgeable prof, I recommend him to anyone that has to take an art history class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bruttalllll teacher.  Expects so much from students in a 100 level class.  Do not take, you will be bombarded with word that is completely unnecessary.  Doesn't know his role as a 100 level teacher, acts as if hes teaching an upper level class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He changed his teaching &quot;strategy&quot; You have to study everyday.  So much studying is needed for this gen ed class that it is not necessary.  Goes over so much material which isn't necessary either.  I was the only one in my class to receive an A, and i strongly don't recommend him. Unless your in love with art history, don't take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2010<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy class IF YOU STUDY. there is  a lot of material for the tests. you will not get an A without studying. if you study, tests arent bad. a lot of memorization. nice guy too</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2010<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well I already took this class, but it didn't transfer. Either way, it was fun to take it again with him. Clever quips and entertaining lectures. I also asked for information on a random outside research topic and he was SUPER responsive and helpful. It's still an art history course so you really need to study. He's made of awesome though!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG! He must be the most knowledgeable professor on his subject ever! The way he talks about the paintings and makes smooth/almost invisible transitions between them is just of top class!!! Being a student of commerce he made me interested in the subject a lot! Also a fairly easy class and very respectful and helpful gentleman! Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2010<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Socki was very straightforward about what would be on the exams and only one paper was assigned. He never specified if attendence was mandatory, but he did take it. I strongly recommend taking him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2010<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME teacher. Speaks softly and can be monotonous & make you fall asleep (not to mention classroom is dimly lit at all times) but EXTREMELY helpful. lectures. 3 exams. one paper. Lets you know everything that's going to be on the exams. Such a nice guy, and just an easy going class. Talks boring but interesting material, you dont want to miss it</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2009<br>Class Name: ART200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Guy had one of those 'put you to sleep' Bob Ross voices. Joe was laid back, and enjoyable to listen to. I hate art, but didn't mind taking his class. Wasn't stressful, assignments were basic and easy and overall, the class wasn't demanding. Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is just awesome.

I would take any class of his. If you ever need help or your grade isn't what you think it should be just go and talk to him. He is willing to explain what you need to improve on.

Yeah, he's a laid-back kind of guy but he knows his art history too! Really loves the subject and will make it accessible for even the most artless student.
