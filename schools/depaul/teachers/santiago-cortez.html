Santiago is a laid-back professor, always pushing back deadlines if needed. No tests or quizzes, no midterm, and an open book, take-home final. If you're looking for an easy class, this is the one for you. Santiago is always available for questions by e-mail, even answering occasionally at 2 am. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2015<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>If your looking to learn things verbally, this isn't the professor for you.

I don't even remember what or if we even have a midterm, but it was around that time that I stopped showing up to class. Everything can be done and learned online, he provides links etc. I showed up for the final project and that was that. Attendance is extremely optional. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2015<br>Class Name: CSC223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cortez is a very thoughtful, intelligent and fair individual. All of the material in this class was very interesting and beneficial to my knowledge as an IT major. I enjoyed his teaching style and feedback so well that I cant wait to take Ethics in Technology with him next semester!  </div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
