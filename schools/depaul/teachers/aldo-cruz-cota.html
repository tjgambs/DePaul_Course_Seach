He has a strong accent, however if you pay attention you shouldn't have issues understanding him. He cannot always explain problems clearly, nevertheless he knows the subject very well! AS LONG AS YOU DO THE WORK, the class is easy, I got an A+. I took him again for Business Calc MAT 135</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2012<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was required for my major and over all very tedious. Your grade is based off the midterm & final. You have five pop quizzes throughout the quarter. If you take this class be prepared to teach yourself the material on your own and spend a lot of time outside of class doing repetitive problems on mymathlab that do not relate to the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2012<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TERRIBLE PROFESSOR!! im warning you now unless you like failing  dont take this class. Does not teach well, gives us packets with notes that are useless, grade is based on midterm and final. I almost changed my major all together because i was afraid all math classes were like this. DONT TAKE HIM</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2012<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very difficult to understand. He gives typed up notes to each student before class,they are considerably pointless. The only helpful thing he offers is mymathlab.com which is useless once you are taking an actual test.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
