Lectures focused on breadth of knowledge rather than specifics, and the exams tested you on specifics. Had to regrade the midterm because nobody did well. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2014<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice lady! I found her to be a very good professor. A bit confusing at times, but very helpful if you need more clarification. I would take her again in a heartbeat.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2013<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is wonderful.  I am now able to construct sentences using all tenses of verbs.  I also feel very comfortable holding conversation.  I have learned a substantial amount from Senora Benedet. Having a book is necessary and as long as you study, there's no way to fail.   She was an amazing teacher and extremely helpful to everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very, very nice person but does not teach. The sections are rushed, her grading is inconsistent, and she is so unorganized it gets in the way of her teaching. She cannot answer questions because she does not know the answer. I would avoid this professor unless you want to teach yourself and constantly argue your grades.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2013<br>Class Name: 105SPN<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for 105 and 106.  She is very nice in class, but when it comes to grading she takes off little points for everything.  I feel as though she doesn't do a good enough job of reviewing for the tests and expects too much out of first level Spanish.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2012<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love Sra Benedet. She has the best interest of her students at heart and does her best to help out if you ask for help our speak up in class when you don't understand. Her only downfall is that she can be incredibly unorganized and gets flustered. Just make sure you communicate with her and she is incredibly sweet and understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2012<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE Profe Sandra. She's so sweet! Wants the best for her students and will help you with whatever you need. And, she makes sure you understand what she's saying. Love love love her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2012<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the nicest professor I've had thus far.  She is super helpful outside of class and is always making sure you understand what's going on.  She isn't the best with explaining grammar, but tries nonetheless. She's slightly harsh on grading papers, but gives you ample feedback prior to turning them in.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Profe Benedet is a very sweet lady. She truly cares for her students and will help you even if you aren't the best Spanish speaker. Sometimes I think she speaks a little too much English, compared to my last teacher who didn't speak one word of English. We go by the book completely which can be a little tedious. Im taking her next quarter!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2012<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Profe Sandra is awesome! You would be an idiot not to take her. Her class is really easy, and even if you aren't good at Spanish she'd be more than happy to help you out. Very nice woman, very laid-back class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2011<br>Class Name: SPN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Benedet is a very nice, sincere, and lenient professor. The class was a bit too easy for me and resembled a high school Spanish course (i.e. video projects). However, once you get to know &quot;profe&quot;, you'll realize that she is very kind-hearted and easy to talk to. She truly wants her students to do well and gives honest advice.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
