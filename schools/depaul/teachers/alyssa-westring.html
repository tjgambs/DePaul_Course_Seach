Her lectures are funny, gives a lot of great examples and we watched many TED talks. She literally spells out how to receive an A in her class. There is studying to be done, but it only requires memorizing the vocabulary. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2015<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so nice and makes class a lot of fun! Everyone should take her! Not a lot of homework at all. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Westing was great. Each class was entertaining. There were 2 assignments (little writing), midterm and final.  She gives in class assignments which is a part of your final grade so show up. Group participation was in every class meeting but they were fun. Study guide is exact questions on test. Hope to take her for all my MGT courses.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the easiest classes compared to what's out there. She does weekly objectives which are like the parts of a study guide. Take in class notes on the pwpt's and flip through the book where needed and you should be good to go. Papers are easy, midterm and final are mostly recalling definitions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2014<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>meh, easy class but kind of boring. not hard to get an A. lenient grader on essays.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very easy class, yet she is very hard working in making you succeed and comprehend the material. She does many ted talks and group activities, which i think it's great.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2012<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Read the book and take notes.

She covers material in her class well. Exercises relate well to material. Required presentation was long in length, but I learned a lot from them. I really enjoyed her as a professor and, if it would count toward my concentration, would love to take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor.
