He is an endless source of knowledge and very passionate about what he teaches. You get out of his classes whatever you put in.  Life is short.  Don't waste your time and sit in the back on your phone. You will learn something interesting every day if you show up.  He is a huge asset to BAC. Glad he transferred.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2012<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the most interesting lectures but he is very straightforward and easy to comprehend. He lets you know exactly what he wants you to learn and you always know what he's going to test you on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2010<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty easy class. At least skim the readings because there will be pop quizzes. Can be a little boring, but it's kinda interesting too. Gives review guides for the midterm & final which help immensely.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2010<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is  easy, but he also is a really nice teacher! You can tell he loves what he does and wants everyone to succeed. 6 pop quizzes, midterm, final, paper, and a couple journal entries. Not bad at all!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2010<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is a typical lecture where he uses the chalkboard and talks about the reading. MAKE SURE YOU AT LEAST SKIM EACH READING. There are pop quizzes, otherwise the class is easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2010<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Keeps lectures fluid and uses chalkboard for emphasis. He grades papers like an English teacher but if you are concise and purely informative (strong opinions and literary flair = no good)  you should have no problem with the 2 short essays. And you can get by with simply scanning the readings before class. Good class that is not overwhelming.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor O'Gorman is a great professor!

The class was a religion class, but he made more of a lit class which is awesome in my book.  He really wants to help students.  Fairly tough grader, but you do learn to be a better writer.  Take this class if you like literature more than religion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very awesome teacher... assignment were clearly laid out.. quizzes (pop quizzes as well) were very easy and to the point... do the reading and you will be fine.. gives extra credit opportunites and cares about what his students are going through.. take him if you can!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2008<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fairly easy class that fills the religion requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2008<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely hard, if you are bad at writing papers don't even think about this class. i've used the writing center for my papers and i still have yet to see a B on my papers.  he &quot;encouraged&quot; me to use the writing center, and i do, so now  what&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2008<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good prof. wants to help his students. he knows his stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2008<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good prof wants to help students. lots of papers but interesting class.</div></div></div></body></html>
