There's quite a bit of reading each week + a 3-4 page reflection paper but he is a fairly easy grader and the readings are usually really interesting.

He is extremely approachable and is never afraid to meet you for coffee or spend a time chatting around campus or after class. I highly recommend him for LSP 200 Multiculturalism & any other Social Science Course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for Explore. The focus was on charter schools, so we went to three schools. He didn't bother to even call ahead to schedule our visits. So, the first school made us wait around for an hour, and the third wasn't even a charter.  Oh, and it was an institute day. Sprang a ten pg research ppr on us Thurs before finals week. Freshman class&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor! In our class we pretty much just had to write weekly reflection papers but they were super easy! In class all you do is discuss about what you have read.  Overall great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's an amazing teacher and is very insightful the class there wasn't a lot of reading but there was 2 major papers that was worth majority of the grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2004<br>Class Name: SOC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE IS THE MOST AWESOME PROF.
