Everything he teaches is directly from the book, and if you question it, he has no idea how to respond. The tests were redic and did not relate to anythingwe learned. The book is a joke as well, the info needed for ch. problems were never even presented in the reading</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2011<br>Class Name: FIN335<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have any interest in learning about financial statement analysis, DO NOT take this professor. After all the time i spent sitting in that class, I have absolutely no takeaway. He reads powerpoint slides directly off the screen and doesnt even know what they are saying; like he never even took a look at the presentation before the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2008<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ABSOLUTELY THE WORST INSTRUCTOR EVER!!! Don't take him. I am furious that someone like him was given job to teach finance major course, where he is clearly himself learning. Uses powerpoint and test problems provided by publisher. Doesn't know anything, and gives such hard exam. Avoid him at all cost!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2007<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this professor!  He has no organization and he cannot teach.  He always makes mistakes and never uses the board to go over problems.  Take Rybak instead</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know if I can say anything positive about him.  It was his first quarter teaching the subject and the textbook (which he's changing) just added to the nightly torment.  He grades on a curve.  I believe he might be effective once he figures out a system and gets organized.  Very knowledgable about the business world though.</div></div></div></body></html>
