She expects a lot from all of her students which is what grad school is about. Not sure if I would take her again, but I am definitely learning a lot from her class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2015<br>Class Name: 501<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What energy and intelligence! Learned a lot in just one session. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2015<br>Class Name: 501<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Rather not say</div><div id="right"><div>She has the superb, uncanny ability to get her class excited about the readings and what she's talking about. And then some just begin talking non-stop. Just glad that she sometimes puts a stop only to communicate her ideas. We're here to learn from her. Disrespectful is the last word i'd ever use to describe her. Perhaps too accepting and kind.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2015<br>Class Name: MPS501<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>The most disrespectful, condescending professor I've ever had. She raises her voice and cuts students off. You can tell she dislikes certain students. There IS a lot of reading, but this is grad school. She's smart & passionate, but could be a better teacher. Also, she focuses heavily on the non-profit sector & very little on gov. or private.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2015<br>Class Name: MPS501<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Learned a whole lot about concepts I had little knowledge of.  And yes, patient with queries and is a wealth of information.  Treats us as adults with a brain and that is certainly something to look up to. Thanks for a great quarter and a fine set of readings and speakers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2015<br>Class Name: 501<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a wonderful and rigorous teacher and teaches to the class, the diverse interests, while also fulfilling her agenda. Comes thoroughly prepared. There are a few who just don't get it and keep pressing her for clarification when all of it is outlined in the syllabus & explained early on. Her patience is an inspiration in itself.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2015<br>Class Name: 501<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I do not find her form of teaching helpful. She assigns hundreds of pages of reading a week and then allows the class to take the lecture where they want it - be it how to cite a source or is the sky blue. Potential to be a great a teacher but she allows discussion to fall unbelievably off topic. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: 501<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great professor, but she's tough, especially on written work. Class participation is also key. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2014<br>Class Name: 510<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very challenging teacher, but you will learn a lot from her classes. She really pushes her students. There is A LOT of reading involved in her classes. Time management is super important.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: 510<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Ramanath is a fantastic professor. She is very knowledgeable in the field of international development, and it is clear she is very passionate. She will make you work for your grade, but duh. This is grad school.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2013<br>Class Name: MPS511<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is wonderful. Enjoying her class and regret that it is getting over soon. Very useful information for organizing a professional or academic career in international development. Nice work with guest speakers too! So inspiring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2013<br>Class Name: MPS501<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was probably one of the best classes I've ever taken at DePaul.  She's tough, no doubt, but brilliant. Opened my mind to many different ideas and really challenged me.  She's super nice and helpful, but she expects a lot out of her students.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
