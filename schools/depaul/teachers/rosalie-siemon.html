She LOVES teaching philosophy, and it totally shows. There is a lot of reading, but you don't need to do ANY of it because she goes over (in great detail) everything you need to know about the reading in class. The assignments are pretty easy if you have good notes too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She checked our reading notes every day, which was something I haven't experienced since middle school.

CLASS IS A BIT DULL AT TIMES, BUT IT IS FAIRLY EASY. JUST DO THE READINGS AND TAKE NOTES AND YOU SHOULD GET AN A. NO TESTS OR FINALS. JUST 3 SHORT PAPERS AND 3 IN-CLASS WRITINGS. CANNOT MISS MORE THAN 3 CLASSES. NO TEXTBOOKS. GRADES PRETTY EASILY, ALTHOUGH SHE DOESNT BELIEVE IN A+ GRADES SO DONT EXPECT TO GET 100 ON ANYTHING</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: LSP220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Out of all the teachers in DePaul she is on of the good ones.

On papers she doesn't comprehend college level word choice(and reduces your grade for using them) but often misuses words. Voice is obnoxious sounds like a prepubescent boy.Will cause headaches daily.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a decent TA.  Still needs to work out the kinks in her teaching and become more comfortable with it.  She could've controlled the class a bit more, I know it was mostly freshmen and she was trying to get their attention, but she has to decide whether she wants respect or to be considered &quot;cool.&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Interesting class, as long as you read, and take notes you will do well. there are just 3 in class writing and 3 papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she likes students who participate, spend time writing the three papers for the quarter, and do some review before the in class writing assignments, she is a fabulous almost professor</div></div></div></body></html>
