He is very lenient when it comes to essays; I was getting a C in the class, wrote an A+ essay, and he brought my grade up to a B. Two tests, and one essay. Overall, he has a lot of experience and knowledge, overall an interesting man to listen to. Would take again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2015<br>Class Name: MGT551354<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are long but the class was from 9-4 one day a week so they had to be. 1 midterm 25%, 1 final 25%, 1 five page paper single spaced 25% due by the last day of class & participation 25%. You get a 15 minute break once every 2 hours and a 30 minute lunch. He reads the ppt and tries to get students involved in conversation. Never used the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2015<br>Class Name: MGT551354<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Book not needed. He reads from his power points and they are 3 h long each. Lectures are boring and takes forever to finish, half of the class literally slept or did something else. 2 tests and a paper, he checks the attendance.  Professor is rude and opinionated. This class could be better if organized differently. Wasting time and money.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
