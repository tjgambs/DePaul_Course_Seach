This course moves very fast but Khananu is a very good teacher and is always willing to help you and the class out. He gives hints during quizzes and midterms.

I was lucky to have this experience at this time, this professor. -wp </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2015<br>Class Name: INTROTOCOMP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>His focus to ensure students' comprehension of material.

His accent may be a bit off-putting at first but you will get used to it.  The workload is very manageable and the quizes he gives aren't too hard.  Just be prepared for the final and midterm though because they are 50% of your grade. Overall professor Khananu was awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful professor!

He was so hilarious and really went through the material. He always encouraged us to ask questions if we didn't understand.TAKE HIM. He's really cool.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Zaya is a fantastic professor who truly shows he cares about each of his students.  I even received one-on-one support on a Saturday morning because I needed help.  He shows passion for his students.  I highly reccommend him as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class,!! However if you struggle in math, the class can be challenging. Not exactly good at &quot;teaching&quot; but the class is easy enough that if you are willing to put in some time you will have no problem!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2011<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really nice and always willing to help. However, teaching through slideshows wasn't exactly helpful for some people. The slides went a little too quick. His hmwk and quizzes are completely manageable. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/18/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is hands down the BEST math teacher I've had in my life. He is always willing to help you out, responds to his emails, explains clearly and is very fair with the workload, completely manageable. He's the reason I passed math, I repeated it badly twice before I took his class and passed well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED I always try to get his class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's seriously  one of the best math teachers I've ever had. He's a great professor and connects with each of his students. The way he explains math allows students to understand the material really well.
