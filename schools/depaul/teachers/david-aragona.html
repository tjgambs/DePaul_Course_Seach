He kind of has an arrogant attitude, but at the same time wants you to think he is cool so he tries to be funny&#63; I don't know the class is easy you just take notes from the power points but it sucks that he doesn't put them on blackboard. Midterm was kind of tricky but he curved it. Enjoyable five weeks.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny teacher, made the class go by fast.  However, for a 100 level class, the test was wayyyy too hard!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's ok. Not that difficult. Tells lots of personal stories which makes the class more fun. The exam was a little challenging. The questions were worded in a weird way. Overall, I would take his class again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he was a good prof. He was easy to understand, gave clear examples, and the final came straight out of the notes. The one paper we had for him was an easy topic.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2009<br>Class Name: COMM101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my best experiences with a professor! He may appear to be tough because your grade basically consists of an essay and a midterm, however, he makes class interesting, and knows how to mix things up with his jokes and bizarre activities. While the test was challenging, he provided the class with everything we needed to know for it. I definitel</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny at first, but lectures get rally boring. He thinks he's so funny....but he's not.  The notes and final do not correspond at all. The final was ridiculous for the ease of the subject matter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: CMN100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny guy, but your entire grade is based off of a paper and a test, which I was not a big fan of. Not &quot;mandatory&quot; attendance, but everything on the test came directly out of class notes. Test was confusing and had to be curved for our class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's a great teacher and there's only 1 paper and 1 test (60 questions)! attendance isn't mandatory but he doesn't put his lecture notes online so you kind of have to show up. he loves what he teachers though so it makes things interesting.. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was alright, nothing like Wow. He was slightly off mentally it seemed, and most of his lectures always relate to his college friends, college years,etc. Not that great of a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: CMNS291<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I might take a double look at him while walking down the street. But listening to him talk makes him hotter. He's hilarious.  Which makes his lectures that better.  Makes fun of himself a lot.  Class got boring sometimes but he made it bearable.  I would definitely take him again. He makes you want to learn.  He explains things very well.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
