Easy class. All I did was show up for class and I got a B+. Although I got some help on the final. Overall, the class is pretty easy. There were only 2 homework assignment and a Final. The homework is done in groups. Good class if you want to get a good grade but make friends.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2004<br>Class Name: MKT315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>cute...but not too nice of a guy! is such a smartass!! he gets mad when u challenge him!! class material not too hard... take the class but don't ****him off or you're screwed!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2004<br>Class Name: MKT315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2004<br>Class Name: MKT3103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really cool teacher, has some attitude, but very cute!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2004<br>Class Name: MKT315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is such a helpful tool in interviews, the methods you learn will really impress marketing execs.
