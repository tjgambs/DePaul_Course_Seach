However, Lynch's lectures really engage you and draw you into more than drinking. What I, unexpectedly, LEARNED from him has given me an edge when I interview and network. It really helps to appreciate wine flavors.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: HSP333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great instructor!

One of the finest professors at DePaul. Teaches courses without putting unwarranted stress on students. I came out feeling like the class was a walk in the park, but have retained more info from his class than any other class I've taken at DePaul. He has vast experience in the industry and has sweet internship hook ups.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor.
