You won't learn a thing!Knows his stuff, but doesn't know how to explain. Just come on days b4 quiz, he'll give you the quiz so if you know how to plug in #'s, you'll get an A. Will def. take the class since it's an easy A,you have to be a brain dead if you don't get an A or a B!If want to learn something, don't take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>YOU WILL NOT LEARN WITH THIS TEACHER.

He gives practice tests before test days, which are the same questions as the test with different numbers, and he explains quiz questions before handing out the quiz. And plus he doesn't really keep track of homework. Take his class, you'll enjoy it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was impossible.  after failing 4 times i finally gave up</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this is the hardest teacher in the world if u want an A dont take him. it was almost impossible to pass for me and i took it 3 times already</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>it's so easy to get an a in this class. the practice tests are exactly the same but numbers are changed. put the test in your book (or write it in your book) and cheat. a monkey could get an a. unless you are determined to learn, take this class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2005<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hate math, Wong is just right for you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2005<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT take this class.

Once I got used to he style of speech, the rest was a breeze.  Stats itself is a dull useless subject, this prof knows it and even jokes about it.
