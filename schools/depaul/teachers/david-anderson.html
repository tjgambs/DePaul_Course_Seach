I've had the benefit of great, challenging professors, however, David is an aweful lecturer and has an obsolete knowledge-base from the 1990s.  Consistently makes inaccurate comments about industries he knows nothing about. No direction whatsoever. Undergrad Freshman students is where he belongs</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2010<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher that tried to work with the class on the cases we wanted to study.  Took interest in what we had to say.  Play a simulation that grade is based on participation, not on the ultimate game results which allows the teams to experiment with different techniques.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2009<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My team and I were doing great on the simulation and class participation.We talked to him about the paper and he made it sound like a formality. We decided to take it easy on the paper and ended up with a B. He has no clue how the simulation works so he makes it up as he goes. The case discussions were pointless regurgitation of information.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2009<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class discussions were relatively pointless and lacked focus. Simulation is downplayed when it could be used as a great teaching tool. Final case study expectations were not clearly communicated.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2009<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class seemed rather pointless.  Studied a new case each week but discussions did not add much value.  Final Paper expectations were very unclear.  Professor seems that he has been teaching this class too long and is going through the motions rather than being interesting and objective.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2008<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I studied for GSB 599 of MBA program in his class. He's very nice and tired to stimulate class to participate. Focus on business case discussion. He used the textbook to refer theories sometimes. I recommend you to study.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2007<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was very excited about the class, contacted us all the time. His class was really easy, I'm not sure I learned anything though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2006<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Anderson is very nice to his students. There are two exams which you may need to study a little bit hard for it, otherwise everything is alright. The lowest grade in the class is a B so take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor was a nice guy - The class material was a mixture of MIS-340 & MGT-301.  This is why it seemed so boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/04/2005<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>How can you dislike this guy&#63;! He is awesome!!! The subject itself is not too intersting but you gotta take it! I did not know anything about this teacher before but I am so glad I took his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2005<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class. Professor is very friendly but is not really knowledgable in the subject.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2005<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst course I took at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2005<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best class and professor in depaul. There is no question about it.  Easy, fun, loves and cares about his students.  Two multiple choice tests and simulation work which is not even graded.  The whole class was just for fun.  And his grading curve is huge. Lowest grade in his class is B :):)</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
