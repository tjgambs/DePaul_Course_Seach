He does not adapt to technology and assume that the way he has taught for decades is the best way. He has two exams both worth 50%. Be ready to read and reread the textbook multiples time to succeed. He uses questions from the online study guide to make sure to go over those (memorize). Do not take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: GSB20<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're not into calculus or stats, this class will be a bit boring.  As long as you do all of the homework and understand it, you'll do fine on the exams.  Midterm was pretty easy, final was much tougher.  Not much interaction during class, so it can be easy to lose focus.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor is a very nice guy and has a good attitude, but his teaching skills are subpar. The classes are almost pointless to show up to as he doesn't ever go over examples to formulas he shows. Basically have to teach yourself. Tests are nothing like what is shown in the book or hw. Tests=105 points each + 10 points for HW / 200 points total.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have an engineering degree and math is my jam.  However, this professor confused me on simple things like how to find the median, or take an average.  His version of going through an example in the book took me back to Kindergarden where he turns the book around to show you the page, points to it and says, there it is.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good teacher at all.

Boring Lectures and mandatory HW and attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a very effective professor. No cheat sheet or book allowed on midterm or final (unlike other GSB 420 profs). Memorized a million formulas, then tests only covered two chapters. Do not take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is difficult w/ lousy book. Flew through the material, but that is the schools fault cancelling two classes. Involves a good deal of studying and make sure you do and know all the homework. Two exams based on problem sets.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2011<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a excellent teacher with great patient. Through his teaching, math and statistics are concrete and  specific laws of business activities rather than some useless and boring formulas. If you do homework everytime, the two exams will be very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sometimes difficult to understand.  3 tests, the first was very easy review but the next 2 were dificult and the questions were not very similar to homework examples. However, if you do the homework and study you should be alright. The class was curved and definitely helped my grade a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Old school teaching style.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2010<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took his Money & Banking class.  GREAT teacher.  READ and LISTEN in his class.  It helps to take notes on his lecture. He defines fairness. One day after class this hot chick tried to &quot;get a few more points&quot; on her test by talking to Batavia about her results. Didn't work for him. He is more than worthy to teach at DePaul.  Highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I usually have tough time with math and stats but he somehow made it very easy for me, most of my classmates were happy with him too, fair grader. I recommend Batavia highly if you want to do well in this class, everything we saw in his class turned out to be pretty useful. A+++</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2010<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Batavia is an awesome professor. The test are not easy, but if you read the material and do the work, you should be fine.

Do NOT take this class, I'm not sure if it was because of the professor or the material, but it's nearly impossible to pass unless it's your second time around taking it. Class's average grade on midterm was 30%, I'm excellent in math and got 17%.

I got a C and REALLY didn't deserve that. He is probably the coolest ECON teacher we have, and easier than most. All you have to do is follow the study guide worksheets & you will do well on tests.

He teaches word for word from the book, and makes learnable information impossible. Class isn't mandatory, but he gives a huge bonus for showing up 100% of the time. His tests are impossible and classes are outrageously boring. I've never seen such a terrible professor.
