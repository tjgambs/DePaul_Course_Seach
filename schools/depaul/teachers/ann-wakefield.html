Professor Wakefield really wants you to do well in this class. This class will help you get over your fear of performing in front of other people and she creates such a relaxed environment.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2014<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ann is one of the best professors at DePaul. She is extremely kind, knowledgable and approachable. She knows theater extremely well, and is probably one of the best people to learn acting skills. Even if you're not an acting major, this class teaches you basic communications skills that you can't learn anywhere else. If you need a fine art, take it</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ann is the absolute sweetest. She is amazing at what she does and treats every student with the utmost respect. Just show up to class, show you're giving effort, and write the papers and you will breeze by with an A. Ann rocks!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2013<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Really quirky woman and class but very knowledgeable. She figures people out fast so pay attention and soak up everything she says. The class is a bit off beat at times but in the end it does help. A lot of improvisational work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2013<br>Class Name: PRF100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really fun class.  She's a cool lady and knows theater very well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely take this class if you are looking for a unique class to fulfill your arts requirement. Not much writing is expected. You have at least 2 papers to write(1pg each), a monologue which you perform to the whole class and then you must perform improv with a partner. This class def. requires one to step out of their own comfort zone!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2009<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>class was alright; scripts studied are studied at almost any high school so i felt bored because i was not learning anything new. midterm/final was alright except that she looks for a certain number of examples but does not ask for a number in the question. she is a great person and has amazing attire, i just would never take her class again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2009<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful Professor! Discussions in class are very beneficial to your grade. There is a bit of reading but the books are inexpensive and interesting. She also has a lovely British accent.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's the best! Write down what is said during lectures because when it's time for the midterm/final, it's all right in there in front of you! In class midterm, take home final (both very easy) and attend a play!! ATTEND CLASS (30% of grade), do the work and it should be an &quot;A&quot;. Such a nice person! A real pleasure to have and would def. take again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty easy.  just make sure you go to every class (30% attendance) and take some notes for the plays she assigns and put it in your paper.  She'll give you an A on the paper if u put some of the crap she says during lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2004<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Wakefield is the sweetest, greatest person ever. She is really helpful and interesting. EASY work, and not much of it, interesting class discussions. I am not a theatre major but she made the plays we read interesting. Participate and respect her and you'll have an awesome time!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2004<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is great. Really fun class and not too hard. Has a wicked French accent. Dresses in about 8 layers of multicolored clothing. Good ole Wakefield. This is a class that you will want to show up to.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: CREW<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she directed for my show, and was amazing</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2004<br>Class Name: THR100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.
