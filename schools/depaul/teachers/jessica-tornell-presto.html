I had her for explore chicago theater and she was really sweet.  If you go to each class and just do the homework, you'll be fine.  I didn't really read the book, just skimmed through and completed the review questions, and used that to study for the final, which really helped.  She is a good and passionate teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: CMN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very sweet personality and very passive and quite.
