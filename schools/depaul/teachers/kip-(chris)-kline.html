The other professors are scary!! Made a hard class, easy and understandable. He usually ONLY teaches in spring, so try to take him if you can. I was totally one of the students he joked with. :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2007<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worse class Depaul makes you take, but managable with Kline....Make sure you try to take him and not the ridiculous Haymes! He def. tries to make friends with you and spends alot of time on jokes. Tries to help you understand topics, but most of the time it is him trying to be funny. 2 small papers, group work, Midterm with notes and take home pape</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2007<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher was ok.  He tried to explain the hard material as best he could; but I think he spent too much time joking with certain students and not enough time helping the students that were really in the dark. Not the best prof. but not the worst.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2006<br>Class Name: LSE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher who has a way of keeping class interesting at all times, and is a very knowledgable and funny professor, also a fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2006<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was terrible! He tries to hard to make a good impression on his students and forgets he has a course to teach.  He is not clear at all and never really gives a straight forward answer. Don't take him unless you want to waste you money.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2006<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>kip is hip! i love his humor! he always brings laughter. all the other LSE 380 professors stink and teaches useless info but kip makes you think...deep...i just wish he taught other classes. there are 2 short papers and one final paper. he is a fair grader as long as you show knowledge of the subject. take good notes in class and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2006<br>Class Name: LSE330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes a good teacher not too much work.
