Sweats a lot in class. Papers sound long, but their length just sort of happens naturally. The textbook is a joke, but useful-ish if you missed class. Nice guy and will spend time in and after class to answer questions. The powerpoints lack substance and depth, but the lectures do not.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: PSY385<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doug is such a cool and chill guy. He was always laughing and smiling and just went with the flow. The class was super easy, and the group project/presentation wasn't bad (a thirty-minute PowerPoint). There was a multiple choice midterm, straight from the book, and no final. No homework either! There was a final paper, but you used an outline.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really is a sweet and nice guy. He is very flexible and throughly goes thru hiss powerpoints. The only problem is that he does not use D2L at all. Never updates any grades on D2L. AND he takes forever to grade things. Exams were scantron and literally took all week to grade!!? As wellas submitting final grades, waits til the last day :/</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2011<br>Class Name: PSY380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice and helpful professor. If you are willing to learn he is willing to help you out as much as possible, but his lectures are quite boring. Bring coffee before you come to his class and you should be good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2011<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's such a nice guy! Boring teacher, but he obviously wants his students to do well in the class. Attendance is not mandatory, but you get extra points for being there. The papers are super easy, as are his exams. The material was interesting, and he does his best.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>eassssssssy class take him! his class is joke! i slept through almost every class and got an a! EASY GRADER! best decision ive made on a professor yet!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2009<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy, but extremely boring. Each class is just Prof. Cellar reading the powerpoint. I went to 4-5 classes, looked over the material the night before, and did the research participation got an A. All of his powerpoints are posted on blackboard!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was extremely boring, although not hard to pass.  I felt I OVER studied for the first test by simply being prepared for everything on the syllabus.  In reality, the midterm only covered the first two &quot;modules&quot;.  Not bad, just boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2008<br>Class Name: PSYCH105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such a nice guy. I didn't look at a single piece of material until the night before the exam ( nor did I go to 50% of the classes) and still got an A on it..no joke. Easy class, nice guy, why not take him&#63;!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2008<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GO TO CLASS! pay attention to his power points and take ALL notes. they're from the book and are on the midterm and final. ALSO read the book as there is info on the tests not presented or covered in class. one midterm, one final, one extra credit paper, 5 hours of research experiments with 2 hours of EC possible. PARTICIPATE AND DO EC!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2008<br>Class Name: PSY385<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher. Ask questions, pay attentions to lecture and you should do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2007<br>Class Name: IO101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was the most boring prof I've ever had. He lectures half of the time and plays awful, unrelated movies for the rest. The class was super easy, but there was absolutely no motivation to go to class. I didn't learn a damn thing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: PSY385<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cellar isn't the most interesting guy and the class isn't the most exciting... In fact, it's basically I/O again. BUT he's a really nice guy and tries really hard. Made our final optional. Easy grader. I never opened the text b/c tests are based off powerpoints.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We watched movies every week and had worksheets to go with them.  Papers were not difficult at all.  Super nice guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2007<br>Class Name: PSYCH385<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was awsome!!  Pay attention to his lectures and powerpoints.  Make sure you go to class even though attendance is not mandatory. He has 4 mandatory simulations for the quarter.  All multiple choice on midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy but NEVER ANSWERS E-MAILS!  Focal point was a waste of my time and too much work (had to make a video) than it was worth.  Don't take him if you don't have to.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: IOPSYCH<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BORING! His lectures are VERY hard to follow. You have to take notes from power point while he rambles on and on and on. It is very hard to concentrate and stay awake. He does provide a study guide before the tests and gives an opportunity for extra credit. He's alright, but I wouldn't recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2005<br>Class Name: PSY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, he is boring.  But SO NICE.  Plus he's a great looking older man!  I thought I was doing terrible in the class but I still ended up with an A.  He's very understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2005<br>Class Name: PSY384<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was very interested in this class - in the begining. He's v. boring and the lectures are quite  disorganized. No handouts on lectures. You have to write like crazy from his PP's and cannot focus on his explanations at the same time. V. Frustrating. I have learned nothing. Not worth it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2005<br>Class Name: PSY384<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is very comprehensible. If you do the reading and go to class he gives you all the notes.  Plus he gives you a study guide before the two tests.  REally nice guy.  Interesting material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher and a easy grader....u can screw up and still get an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: IOPSY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He means well but he is boring.

Easy bc everything covered is organized on power pt. & he gives you actual questions from the tests as review. Midterm and exam are only grades taken and attendance isn't mandatory(but notes aren't online). Extra credit paper too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2004<br>Class Name: PSY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A.
