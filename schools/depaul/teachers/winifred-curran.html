Class is also very easy but sometimes a little boring. Do the readings every week because there are pop quizzes that are heavily weighted. One final portfolio/paper. Overall, she is very knowledgeable and gives a great introduction to urbanization. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: GEO103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what the person under me is talking about because I'm in GEO 103 right now and Curran is awesome. The class is super easy if you pay attention and at least try to learn a little bit. Ask her questions! She's happy to answer anything. She's also very easy to contact.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2012<br>Class Name: GEO103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is very comprehensible during class and easy to understand what she is talking about during class, but when it comes to the only two assignments she ever gives in class your all on your own and there is no way to get the assignment right, there are only two essays during the year and she doesn't help one bit with them and everyoneflunks</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2011<br>Class Name: GEO299<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was ok. In her lectures she was very articulate, clear, and witty. But! This class was so boring! The readings were absolutely awful and she would create long explanations that didn't seem to explain much. I don't know if she is just dull or the class was difficult to teach. I would try to avoid this class, I heard she was ok in others though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2008<br>Class Name: GEO333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty pompous and a New York City elitist.  She feels that New York City is the only city on the planet.  Tough grader.  Very vague when it came to what she wanted from you in papers.  Loved the one kiss up in the class who went well over his presentation time.  I'm sure there are better profs out there.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2008<br>Class Name: GEO333<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was very interesting. I was able to gain a very good prospective on Urban life. It was fairly easy too, but it can be a lot of things going on at once. With two presentations, a final paper, and the affordable housing inventory/paper, it can be tedious. But Winnifred was fun, cool, and a good teacher overall. Just make sure you keep up!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2007<br>Class Name: GEO233<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>doesnt tell you at all what she expects on papers or tests.  then when she hands back the first paper, and everyone has D's and F's on it, she figures its all our fault and not her bad teaching.  assumes we know as much as her and if not that we are bad people for not knowing it.  dont take her please</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2007<br>Class Name: GEO233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is cool in my opinion and knows her stuff. She seems a but lazy though in my opinion. Btw get on her good side because is she likes you you will definately do well in her class. I think I didn't deserve the grade I got, mine should have been lower, but she loved me so I got a pretty good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2007<br>Class Name: GEO266<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart-- unlike a lot of profs, she seems to have a genuine interest and passion for the subject matter. you MUST do the reading, unless you are at her level of knowledge in this area. All tests are directly from the text and most discussions where your notes come from do not cover all of that material. Highly recommend the class to all majors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2007<br>Class Name: GEO233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Comparative Urbanism is one of the most interesting classes I've had at DePaul, and Dr. Curran's lectures are excellent.  She has no sympathy for people who don't do the reading, so if you're willing to crack down a bit and read an amazing book by Howard Berman, take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: GEO266<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>10 page research paper, 2 tests, fair amount of reading. Overall interesting class but do not take if you are not interested in learning. She is extreamly smart and expects you learn the topics. You will learn a lot if you take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2006<br>Class Name: ISPGENT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>unclear on what she exactly wants in your papers and very strict grader on top of that. but very passionate of the subject and is willing to help if you don't understand the material</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not as helpful as she could have been.

She was a good teacher, and really seemed to care about her studends.  She was very helpful with my final research paper. I also thought she was a fair grader.  The readings were interesting.  The class overall forced me to think about the world in a very different way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: HON204<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow...

Also, be prepared for a lot of work that can get very tedious. Overall the class is very easy, but there is a lot of work that is involved. As far as grading goes, there is no rubric for what she looks for in an essay and as long as you do the Building Survey, you get an A on it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: COMPURBANIZ<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes she is somewhat difficult but she is clear, you must read.

She is so full of it, it's ridiculous.  Her grading is insane and she treated her students like we were a bunch a morons.  She knows a lot, but her class format sucked and made it difficult to get a good grade.  Avoid her unless you like having your intelligence insulted.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2005<br>Class Name: GEO233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting lectures but her grading scheme is totally arbitrary, she provides no clues as to what is expected in the answers to her overly-broad, overly-vague essay exams, and she's what we call in the business a &quot;B-plusser.&quot; She just can't bring herself to write 'A'  But yeah, she's a hotti</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2005<br>Class Name: GEO<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RUN AS FAST AND AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS CLASS AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN.
