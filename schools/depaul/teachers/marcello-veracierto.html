The professor was extremely knowledgeable about the material, but was not an effective teacher. Little to no discussion in class-format consisted of professor lecturing from slides. He also did not follow the book. Difficult to understand professor due to accent. Final difficult which was 70% of grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class Structure 70% Final 30% Group Project.  Test exclusively from lectures but book is useful to understand some topics clearly.  Fairly dry teaching style.  English language a minor barrier to communication.  Difficult to know what to expect on the final, but exam ended up being very reasonable but not easy.  Overall Avg to Below Avg professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2006<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures were not clear and he did not follow the book so it was hard to reinforce the material.  He only gave one exam worth 70% of the grade and it was very difficult to study for as he did not give any indication of the material to study or the format of the exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2005<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First day of class he said it was his first time teaching this class (Spring 05).  He is can be a little difficult to understand.  He does not explain the material and just reads from his slides.  I found the book more useful.  The only thing that saved my grade was the curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2005<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very intelligent on the subject matter but has a hard time putting it in basic terms.  I found the midterm to be ok, but the final was extremely difficult.  He does curve though so that helps the situation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgable guy, but quite difficult to understand.  Exams are based off of lecture notes, so if you basically memorize them, you should be fine,</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2005<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is very intelligent but because he is speaking in his second language and does not appear to be very comfortable teaching....this class is quite difficult! Tests are brutal. Be prepared to work!</div></div></div></body></html>
