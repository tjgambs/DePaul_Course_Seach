DON'T BE FOOLED. He's condescending and when you ask a question he will act like you're stupid. There's no required homework and a math class is the only class that should have that. He'll flat out say "you understand? No? Of course you don't" Very rude!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this professor. He is a horrible teacher. He gets easily frustrated when you ask him a question or to take a moment to clarify. I seriously learned more from the college student math tutors than him. He makes you pay almost $110 for the online HW access code plus the really expensive depaul book ($100-180). Believe me, do not take him. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div> The material he presents consists of book examples or one he makes up on the spot.   Without prepared lecture notes, this produces many algebra mistakes. Doing the homework doesn't help for his exams. They consist of material that hasn't been covered since basic algebra, like  (x-y)^3(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2), only you will have to integrate this.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His accent is hard to understand, he is a nice guy but cannot teach math to someone who doesn't know math very well. Everything was unclear and there wasn't any homework. I honestly don't know how he's still teaching when 3/4 of the class failed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy. Definitely a teacher for higher thinkers. I felt bad for the kids that weren't good at math, though. If you are good at math, take him. I got a 100% in the class and didn't do an ounce of homework. If you aren't good at math.... Find some one else haha. Really great guy though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! He comes off as a nice guy at first, joking and letting you out of class early. He dodges questions with rude comments. You insult him if you don't know something. He can't break math down to an understandable level. Tests are impossible and he's a tough grader. I had peer and private tutors, worked hard, only to fail.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A low quality professor at DePaul. You only have a midterm, take home and a Final which hurts your grade tremendously if you preform poorly on one. Explains Calculus horribly, obviously is not teaching his calling.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2011<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting lectures that always let out early.

Class was never mandatory, he always let you leave early, and there was never any homework. Because I had already taken it this class was low priority for me and this class requires no outside work besides one take home test. If you have already taken calc take him to save some time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does not explain concepts well, and by mid-quarter has very rambling lectures that sometimes do not relate to the subject.

Please do not suffer like I did. I am a hard-working student and loves math, but this calculus class was a joke.

Just like many students, I was happy to get out of class early. But his test are nearly impossible if you have never taken calc before. He hates helping students and he cannot teach. Good luck if you take this class. You'll need it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>How can this professor keep a job & waste students money with such low reviews.

If your an honest hardworking student that just needs a little help to understand his unorganized way of teaching forget it!  He does not care about your sincere effort to learn or dedication to being on time! He lies about the material on the test & drops a randon bomb on test day.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2009<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really funny and interesting professor. However, if you need everything clearly explained, he's not your guy. He's not good at helping you understand the material - which is very difficult.  If you already took calc and dont mind teaching yourself from your book this might be your class because that's exactly what you have to do.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2009<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seems like a nice guy but what he says is quite a far cry from what he does.  This teacher is like a deceptive assassin; he lulls students into a false sense of confidence by stating that exams &quot;will be easy&quot; but then he drops bombs in tests that really make one feel betrayed.  He is lackadaisical and difficult to relate to.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I recommend vlad if you have taken calc before. He lets you out early and class is not mandatory. I got an A, but I did have to work for it.

The people who did well in my class already took calculus. the ones who didn't failed. be prepared to go above and beyond to pass this class because just doing the work wont do it unless you're a math super genious. i had to put in ALOT of time and effort to barely pass with a C-</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORK HARD AND HE GIVE You good grade.

Do not take if you need a structured and organized lecture. He doesn't really assign homework and you get out really early every class.

He teaches fast though.  Thank God I learned calculus in high school. You better study and keep his pase. In five weeks we learned all the material we had to for the quarter. He likes everyone to have a good time. He cares more about your learning experience than your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: MTH101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken MTH 101 before this class and did very well. I do all my work and he is actually not a great teacher for MTH 101 I do believe that he is very knowledgable. He is flexable on how he teaches, he will ask what kind of structure the class would wants is probably better for higher level math</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: MAT2406<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have not met a more well-informed knowledgable professor. He is very verbose and well-spoken and you really need to do a lot of self-study. Integrates humor and friendliness effectively. I'll take him for discrete mathematics again!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
