A good mathematician but a very poor communicator and she didn't seem to care if a student struggled. She simply was not interested. Perhaps she should have gone into research, but definitely not teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2009<br>Class Name: QR101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She talked behind my back and prevented me from learning in a subject I have always had issues with. She favored male students and I would have never known she was discussing my weaknesses in Math, grades and SELF unless a kind student who I wasn't even friends with but had went to h.s. with and heard my name informed me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2006<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Best Profesor at DePaul. Really cares about her students and will be there to help if you been the extra help. She has been the only Prof at DePaul that genuingly has cared about her students. She will help you until you get it!

I wish her all the best as she ventures into the world of high school math.  She's such a cutie and extremely helpful and knowledgeable about her subject.  Her assistant was also a cutie and very helpful.  He did a fine job of grading!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2005<br>Class Name: MATH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear and helpful, quiz and test are based on hw and class disscussion problems.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Tolias is someone who is clear and understanding. However, I feel ISP 120 was the biggest waste of time. The class taught me almost nothing, and while the homework was easy, it was extremely time consuming. If you do need to take ISP 120 though, Dr. Tolias is a great professor to have.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prob. the best QR prof. Real nice, first teacher to actually show how math is valuable in real life. Likes to be called by first name, which tells you a lot. Have fun with her, but take her class seriously at the same time, bc she does and expects respect, never skipped a class bc I didnt mind going</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: ISPQUANREAS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice and knowledgeable teacher, can be clearer on certain things but overall she was pretty cool.  (Side note- Don't get on her bad side)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's an okay professor. She has a TA grade all of the homework in which the TA grades awful. Overall, she is nice and always willing to help you. However, she should grade her own papers and go over her lecture notes for longer than 10 minutes in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: MATH215<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The math reasoning class was mostly learning on your own and then having to come to class just to have her go over the homework. Meanwhile she never teaches you anything. Take it she sucks. I had to drop her class it was so awful. If you take math reasoning take it with Dr. Gato instead.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2005<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tolias is a very nice teacher. She is willing to give you help during office hours, or after class. Makes math relate to YOU. I found her very helpful, if you do the homework you should be relatively okay on the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>probably the best teacher you can take for QR. the homework can be kinda time consuming. all the information in the class was very knew to me...but i ended up getting a B anyway.  I totally recommend Georgia!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2004<br>Class Name: QRC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice and approachable! if you need help and are willing to stay after class she will always help! sometimes the homework seems like a lot but it's worth it when the midterm and final come up! definitely recommended!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2004<br>Class Name: QUANTREAS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class but you have to show up everyday.

She lets you work at your own pace, and is eager to help when you have questions. She goes over all the class notes and posts them for you to print out. Homework can be done in groups of up to three people.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice.

Sometimes unprepared which is not cool when the entire class is confused.

Her notes are very clear and concise, and she made sure everyone was able to attain a clear understanding of the subject matter. There is a lot of work, so don't fall behind.

She is very flexable and will help you with anything.  She may be a little boring and repeatative, but you leave the class knowing what you're going.

I did not enjoy it at all.  Her lectures as well as assignments are boring and soooo repetitive! An example would be questions &quot;part a-e&quot; on #1 are all asking the same thing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2004<br>Class Name: MAT141<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice teacher who explains everything well.

Homework was easy and done in groups all year. She lets you leave when you are finished and let the whole class leave hours early for a Cubs game.

SHe explains everything soo well and so clear, it is the first time I can really understand math not just do the work.  Any class you can have her as a teacher, take it.  Her ways are easier and clearer.</div></div></div></body></html>
