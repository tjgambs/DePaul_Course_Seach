She's aware of how sensitive some people are about public speaking and she made a really comfortable community out of her class. A lot of work for this class, but you pick your speech topic so it really is what you make of it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2014<br>Class Name: INTC220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Public Speaking as a 5week summer course and completely regret taking it.This professor expects your speeches to be 10000% perfect & despite reviews below, she is a highly unfair grader and will knick you for the smallest things, including "tardiness" even if you walk in RIGHT ON TIME and she hasn't taken attendance. I wouldn't suggest her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2013<br>Class Name: PUBLICSPEAKING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As long as you do the assignments and show interest in the call you'll be fine. She's a really nice lady and will work with you if you need help...although her class is pretty easy. For the most part she keeps class interesting. You can get away without reading anything she assigns. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2013<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers I've ever had at DePaul. She challenges you but there is no way to walk out of her class without learning something that's seriously valuable in the "real world."</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: INTC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic professor. Really takes an interest in her students. I saw so much improvement in everyone's speaking abilities. Can be a tough grader, but she teaches a necessary skill very well. Highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2012<br>Class Name: CMNS230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yeah, she can be kind of critical and expects a lot out of you even if you have no previous experience with theatre, acting, or performing literatre. Overall, the class was a good experience. She's a very nice professor and will help you when you need it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor wil go above and beyond to help you out especially if public speaking isnt your thing. She's awesome, energetic, helpful. Yes she's honest, but extremely fair and critiques tastefully and constructively, she's there to help outside of class if u need it and makes the class fun and engaging. Amazingly nice and cool. ignore neg reviews</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She made me a worse speaker. I basically had two things &quot;wrong&quot;, i said um a lot and I talked fast. She made me nervous to talk and she was way too technical. I guess it is her job, but she worked in &quot;theatre&quot; and she acts like we all need to be pros. Avoid her if you can</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. D'Aurelio is an extremely energetic and engaging professor. She really wants her students to do well and offers very helpful advice on ways to improve your public speaking abilities; although sometimes her criticism is very honest and straightforward. She is an actual public speaking coach on the side. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>prof d'aurelio is absolutely amazing. i am scared of public speaking, and she makes everyone feel comfortable, esp in front of the classroom.  she's funny and easygoing, and is very helpful.  take her if you really think public speaking will benefit you in the future! i love her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. D'Aurelio definitely helps with the public speaking and lowering the fear and upping the success of the delivery skills (which she emphasizes constantly). A bit of a harsh grader, but her comments only help your skills as a speaker. She helps with topics too, if you're unsure on what to talk about.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class will certainly improve your public speaking skills. Professor D'Aurelio is very big on performance and you get that she genuinely cares about your improvement. Can be a bit harsh on grading the speeches, but she justifies everything with details. Five speeches, two quizzes and attendance counts - but you'll learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2007<br>Class Name: CMN230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really perky, really fun..not a horrible grader.  She's really straight forward with all of her assignments and gives a lot of positive feedback if you mess up on something.  Great professor, really sweet lady</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: CMN230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rediculously fun!!!! Shes willing to help anyone at anytime. No worries if you don't know how to act, you'd be suprised how fun and encouraging she makes it. I was the only person in my class who wasnt a theater major but loved it! She gave 30pts. extra credit just for watching her in a play! If you want a class you'll absolutely enjoy take this!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: CMN230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was FABULOUS!! As long as you TRY she will give you a good grade. Attendance very important, as long as you show up though she'll like you! You don't need experience to perform!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: CMT220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. D'Aurelio, was a hard grader but she helped me a lot to be able to perform in front of class without being afraid. She is a though grader though, so you need to pay attention the time limit she sets.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2006<br>Class Name: PUBLICSPEAKING<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's ok. I thought that the class helped me become a better public speaker, but she kind of screwed me over with my grade(C, should at least got a B).I talked to a few other people in the class since it ended and the same thing happened to them. She's a tough grader. I agree with the time limit thing, it sucked. Nice person though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2006<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>PROF. D'AURELIO IS ONE OF THE BEST TEACHERS AT DEPAUL! DOES A GREAT JOB AND HELPS STUDENTS GET OUT OF THEIR SHELL. I HAD A FABULOUS TIME IN HER CLASS AND ACTUALLY THE WHOLE CLASS LOVED HER! I WOULD DEFIENTELY RECOMMEND HER TO EVERYONE!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: PUBLICSPEAKING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutley LOVED this class. Professor D'Aurelio is a lot of fun and makes every class entertaining. This class forces you to open yourself up and put down your guard... It seemed like a big step for a lot of people and she really helped each person learn how to do their best. I would definatley recommend her, she is very understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2006<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the post about her time limit issue.  She bases way too much importance about time limits.  If you went over by 1 second you lost a whole letter grade.  Basically you can give a terrible speech material-wise and as long as you stay within the limit you can get 100 percent.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2006<br>Class Name: CMN230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor is the Meryl Streep of this course - the good Meryl Streep, not the Death Becomes Her Meryl Streep.  She made me wash her clothes once, but she did it with aplomb, so I forgave her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: PUBLICSPEAKING<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Eh, she was all right.  She was nice and all, but she was unclear when she graded my papers.  Also, she was so damn picky about time limits...you literally got a whole grade lower if you went one second over the time limit. Ugh.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: CMN210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hot as heck. she is soooo such a cutie pie. i loved her class for learning.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: CMN230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kirsten is a great public speaker and has a great personality. She is very knowledgeable on her lectures and respects the opinions of her students. She is very helpful and if you like to perform, this is the class for you.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
