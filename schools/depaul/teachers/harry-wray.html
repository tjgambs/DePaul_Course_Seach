You read a couple books with an exam, write a paper, and a final.  The problem is, he grades really tough - and although he says he does not care what your political views are, he does.  This is obviously proved by the grades given on exams...But overall - hes a REALLY great guy and I enjoyed the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2010<br>Class Name: PSC213<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yup, crazy number and types of ties.  It is fun.  Dry sense of humor and passionate about subject. Most work is reflective so not too difficult and texts sort of interesting.  Easy grader and weekly journals not graded til end so u can turn stuff in late. Good class, take it if u gotta</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bottom line: he's kind of crazy. Yeah, his ties are eccentric, but that's about as far as it goes. His politics are ridiculous, and he acts as though he's indifferent to everything in the beginning. He'll throw you for a loop with that one about two weeks in.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2009<br>Class Name: LSP100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Supper nice guy.  Passionate about what he does.  Great person, lost of class discussion on readings.  Can't say he is at the top of his field, but he is great teacher and I loved his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of 2 best professors I have ever had. No one can say he's hard, you have to do one journal a week,read 2 books w/ 3 quizzes & a couple essays. Done. He lectures, doesn't require notes,doesn't care if you show up, but you'll miss important lectures. He is a product of the 60's which is why we got along great. Crazy ties, he even had a metal tie.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2008<br>Class Name: PCS120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor Ive had at DePaul.  Really knows the material well and lectures in an interesting way.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, one of the best I've had.  He makes the class material really interesting, easy to understand, and relevant.  Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely one of the best professors I've had. I wasn't interested in politics but he made me realize different issue going on in our society. Not a lot of work, but take notes or you'll fail the final. Otherwise, I would love to take another class from him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked him alot. Hes very nice. All we had to do was a 1 journal due every week, 2 quizzes (on The Weather Makers & Sick), and a final. It was a good class & it made me interested in politics.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy teacher, but likes to talk a lot and gets kind of boring. But like everyone else said, he has sweet ties.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked Prof. Wray, he is a nice guy. He has awesome ties and I think he truly wants to see his students do well. I would take him for any politics class. All we had were a journal due every week, one 5-7 page paper, and a final. Not that bad.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Harry's the man if you're looking for a helpful professor that knows his stuff and has a snazzy tie for every day of the year. He'll take time out to fix a flat tire any day.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2006<br>Class Name: PSC216<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was not at all what I expected. Professor Wray is VERY abstract, but his discussions are thought provoking. I somehow feel as though we were never quite on topic. He'll challenge you, and he's not an easy grader. It was my first B in college.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is base on class discussions. One paper about you, in politics, 5-7 pages. And a final. Really there is no homework, plus he has a nice tie collection. Take this class, for an easy A. Since i dont really like politics this class, really gives you an eye opener.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: PSC321<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is an interesting prof. overall i liked the class and the work load wasn't bad. there is a massive project at the end but he helps you along the way. he goes on tangents half the time but class was pretty interesting and fun.he will put you on the spot though</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: PSC213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher, and a really interesting man.  I enjoyed his class even when he was ranting - great insight into current political system.  Funny, and great tie collection! Take him - no regrets!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: BIKINGPOLITICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Harry is an awesome teacher, one of the best i've had. Very personable, funny, and charismatic. He does whatever he can to help you and managed to make a 60 mile bike ride seem unintimidating.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2005<br>Class Name: MULTIPLE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Harry when I was a raging young conservative.  And never once did I feel like he was downgrading me for my opinions. He challenged me and made me vigorously defend myself, but he never insulted me or made me feel inadequate.  Rather, he seemed to enjoy disagreement.  I sense anyone complaining about him gets all their thought from Fox News.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although he's a nice person, he does expect some political knowledge out of you.  The class consists of weekly journals based on newspaper articles, one paper and final exam.  He's an okay teacher, but to get an A you must know your stuff in politics.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Even though his teachings/gradings seem a bit downright unbiased, this man favors a more leftist side when all is said and done. Not the hardest teacher, but damn far from an easy one.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2005<br>Class Name: MANY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wray is not one of the worst teachers; he is one of the BEST. His classes are extremely interesting and enlightening. Do not listen to those who say he is biased, it just shows their own biases. Even though he has strong opinions, it does not affect his teaching or grading at all. So if you want to learn, take one of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best prof. I've had at DePaul. Charismatic and interesting.  Tough but acheivable A. Only class I've ever been able to get up for at 9:40.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: BIKINGPOLITICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Harry was awesome for this Discover class! He's very helpful and has lots of interesting stories to tell! He's great because he's easy to talk to and makes the class fun! P.S. He always wears the funniest ties!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really nice guy and very into what he's teaching. He is of the leftist persuasion, but that's cool with me. He really made me think differently about America.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice and approachable.  Lecture based class.  Leans left.  Very interesting overall.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2005<br>Class Name: LOTSOFPSCS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Wray is definitely not biased when it comes to grading students. He is tough with everyone – liberal or conservative. (But he DOES make his opinions known). Interesting classes, difficult grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2005<br>Class Name: MEDIAPOLTICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Only biased against Republicans who dont know anything.  I am hard to the right and got an A even expressing my opinions.  People are not right or wrong Wray says, they just are.  There is not enough space to say all the good things about Wray.  Take him as often as you can!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definately a goofy guy. Like the person below said.. DO NOT take this class if you're Republican. He is a good professor, but he is extremely biased,. almost to the point where its unfair for kids who are at all conservative. He will shoot you down if he thinks you are wrong. Overall, decent guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2005<br>Class Name: PSCS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wray is a very knowledgeable professor, but a very weird grader. He assigns work that seems straightforward, you work hard on them, but then you get lower grades that you did not expect. He is not clear on what he wants. Be prepared to be challenged on your papers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT TEACHER, PRETTY EASY AS LONG AS YOU GO TO CLASS AND LISTEN</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a cool teacher.  do the work and you'll be fine.  I see him walking on the street sometimes and we always stop to have a conversation.  His material is also very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2005<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Wray was a very very interesting guy. He made us go to a sleep deprivation chamber for class!!! It was nuts, if you work for it you'll get the A you deserve...if you slack...you'll get a B+ like me!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/18/2005<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great character+ fun ties = the best bearded professor in the Poli.

Bush won anyways so ill take the c+ with pride.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2004<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great instructor, not only does he know what he's talking about (a doctorate in political science), but he communicates it very well to his class.  He's a liberal, and although it shows through a little during his lectures, it NEVER shows through in his grading, which is very commendable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He says his classes will be fun then they turn into a bore. he can make people think of other topics yet also can put you alseep.  he is a hard grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2004<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Wray is a great instructor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2004<br>Class Name: PSC216<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gives very interesting views on culture. The books are easy to read and enjoyable. The papers are about visiting places and you give your view on the affect on our culture. The grades on papers are often strange.

Your grade depends on your participation, midterm, paper, and final exam. The tests are weighted heavily. Final paper is 15 pages long, he grades based on how much you challenge yourself. Fashion statement expert!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2004<br>Class Name: SOC213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such a nice and laid-back guy.

You don't have to go to all of the classes because the themes a pretty basic. He assigns awesome projects and all you have to do is write simple 2 pagers.
