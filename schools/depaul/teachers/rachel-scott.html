She knows an incredible amount of information and has real world experience.  In focal point Real Life CSI, there were no tests- only papers.  If you put in work and participate in class discussion, you should end up with a good grade.  Would definitely recommend. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: HON225<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Scott is absolutely amazing because she has clear lectures that all build on each other and nothing is repeated. She is intelligent but can explain the material so you can understand it. This course was bioanthropology and is not as hard as it sounds. I thought the material was interesting and the labs informative. 1010 would take again.</div></div></div></body></html>
