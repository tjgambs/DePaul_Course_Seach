If you need to fill an Arts requirement, this is the class to take. 1-2 page reflections due each week, but its pretty easy stuff. No textbook, just one book you have to purchase for like $12.  The course itself is very enjoyable, watched recent TV shows and talked about them. TAKE THIS CLASS, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2015<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Would love to take again.

It is  Finals week and he still hasn't posted our midterm grades. He assigned 2 papers which appears won't even be graded. He is very knowledgeable and passionate about topic, but isn't passionate about grading the work he assigns.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2014<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Non-film major looking to fulfill an art requirement. Deserves the chili-pepper for sure. Made coming to a 3 hour lecture worthwhile. PowerPoints were clear and posted so it was easy to follow along. Movies were also posted so you could re-watch for homework assignments. I would recommend this class for sure!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2014<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>FANTASTIC professor!! He really knows his stuff and he is awesome with helping students one on one to meet their goals and really understand the material. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2014<br>Class Name: DC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Really helpful and knowledgeable about the course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2014<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wimp is a really cool and chill guy.  He always wants you to succeed and as long as you try to do the work on time then there is no reason to not get an A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2012<br>Class Name: DC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wimp is an awesome guy.  He's got a great sense of humor and is really laid back (as everyone else has mentioned) but it's true that his monotone voice can put you to sleep.  He makes all of the class material incredibly accessible though, so even if you dose off you can still look up notes/slides/video of the lecture on COL.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: DC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really laid back, and very helpful. His lectures can put you to sleep because of his monotone voice but still he gives you helpful info. If you ask him anything he always gives you the best responses. He's funny and pretty cool</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2011<br>Class Name: DC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool professor. When he gives his lectures on screenwriting it can feel like he speaks in monotone, but other than that, he's pretty much a laid back guy. He gives as much help as you need on our screenplays. He's not strict at all on people coming late or skipping a class, just as long as it doesn't act as a trend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2011<br>Class Name: DC210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wimp is really laid back and easy to get along with. Attendance is &quot;mandtory&quot; but as long as everybody isn't ditching his class he doesn't care. Just show up, follow the requirements of the assignment, put forth an effort and you'll do just fine.</div></div></div></body></html>
