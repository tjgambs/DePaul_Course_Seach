No tests, just a few papers that are not long. Somewhat of a hard grader but if you participate, it will help your grade. Overall amazing class and great teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2015<br>Class Name: HST273<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would never be one to take the time out to rate a professor on this site, but for Julia Woesthoff I genuinely wanted to. Her lectures are interesting, class discussions are engaging if you're willing to participate (which she strongly encourages), and the workload is decent. Reading is a must, but it's never an insane amount. Take her classes!</div></div></div></body></html>
