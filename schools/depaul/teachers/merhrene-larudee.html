This human being has no personality of her own, let alone in her classes! Stay away from taking her at all costs! Biggest waste of time and college tuition. I would've enjoyed flushing my tuition down the toilet a lot more!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2007<br>Class Name: INT205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, knows a lot about the subject</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2007<br>Class Name: INT405<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgable and passionate about the issues she teaches. Great book selection. The material will be invaluable to my future work. At times, her passion came across through diatribes against students. Difficult class, and also a bit dry. Not very affirming- very critical and defensive. I appreciate her effort, but also struggled w/ some issues</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: INT305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst professor I have ever had! She is horrible! She might be a smart woman but she does not know how to teach, especially not at a graduate level. Not only is she not able to answer in-class questions raised by the students, but she is also very disrespectful of her students often interrupting us before we can finish expressing our op</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has to be the worst teacher ive ever had in my life.  She doesnt know anything about the subject, and can never answer any of the questions brough up in class.  DO NOT TAKE A CLASS FROM HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: INT205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her alot. Alot of reading in INT 205, so be prepared for that. Professor Larudee, is very knowledgeable in Economics, and she is very nice. I recommend taking a class with her. I was able to learn alot in INT 205 about globalization and the WTO, that will be useful knowlege in my future studies.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2005<br>Class Name: INT205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class material is very interesting.  There is a lot of reading and she is somewhat of a tough grader.  She is very nice and very knowledgeable about economics and the international scene. The assignments were somewhat unclear, but if you ask her, she'll explain in another way or again.  She is understanding about the workload.  Take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel bad for her.  She is teaching material that no one wants to take and there are alot of assignments, not sure that it is actually her fault.  She is extremely nice and tries to be fair in grading, but I think her explanations may sometimes be less than 100% clear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was by far the WORST class I have ever taken. Not only did I not want to be there, she made everything so difficult even though it is a freshman class. Her Assistant was more help. I srongly suggest that you get the hell out of her class while you can. SHe failed me with no justification</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the worst teachers ever. she cant even teach the material, so why is she teaching the class&#63; very nit picky on the hw assignments and cant explain anything for peanuts. really hard exams and very unhelpful. i tried getting help to improve my grade, and it left me even more unclear than before. dont take her. sooo boring, id rather pull my ow</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely unclear and the students know how to do things in the class more than she does.  The entire class is done with her TRYING to figure out the class and material. I hope she is better at teaching International Studies courses.  A lot of homework and class will be the entire 3 hours! Good luck</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was ok, but she didnt really know what she was doing. =/</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice person- not the best teacher, though. The way she explains the material is not very clear. The class is extremely boring. I feel that she could make it more interesting. But, I also had it for 3 hours on Mondays. So, most classes would be boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really nice but the ISP 120 was soooo boring. That's not her fault I guess. Also mostly everything we did was in groups which is good, except for the exams, which were a lot harder than you'd expect and took a long time to do! She was very willing to help outside of class, she's pretty nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2004<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class discussions were not effective considering that most of class did not read what was assigned and she did fail to guide the discussions. But if you read most material and do the papers you can get an A.  Nice prof that does know her stuff. Be warned tests are harder than you may think.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: INT205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart woman. She encourages not to take everything for given that is written in books or elsewhere. She is a really nice person. Be prepared to read a lot. The papers are not very difficult, yet they take a lot of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2004<br>Class Name: INT205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely boring, long readings, easy papers, hard tests, gets off topic a lot. Worst class I've ever taken. Even though I did learn a lot... it was incredibly boring to get there.</div></div></div></body></html>
