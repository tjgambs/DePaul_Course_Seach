She keeps class very interesting, and if you have some prior knowledge of sexuality going into the course there is no way you will get lower than a B. Great class I highly recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly recommend this professor. She knows what she's talking about. There are weekly responses to do, a presentation, and a final paper. Its really easy stuff, and really interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Men beware. I allign myself as a feminist and this class was tough to take at many times. Granted much of the material relates more so to women, but men are consistently left out of and not involved in the material creating an alienated and frustrated feeling for men. Men were sometimes allowed to be bashed in some discussions by the teacher too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All I have to say about this class is: 1-Its huge.There were about 50kids in my class.  2-Absolutely NO topic is taboo or spared in this class, she covers EVERYTHING, so it can be totally uncomfortable. 3-Midge is nice, but kinda spazzy & doesn't learn names. She always seemed uncomfortable answering kids questions too. Always kinda rushed class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, you dont have to buy books but she makes you read like 5-10 pdf/word documents on blk board, which gets annoying and $$$ and cite them in weekly papers 9 or 10. Ps.. they are not short articles either and u have to discuss them in class. This class is very time consuming!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the greatest professor in the psych department.  She is very knowledgable and helpful!  She makes sex even more fun to learn about than you thought it could be!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Humor and Group Identity: Nice lady, was clear and used power point a lot. There is one presentation you do, and there are response essays, but nothing super hard. It was a fun class, and I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2005<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated this class.  It had so much potential to be something more.  I think that she is a good person and has interesting things to say, but too often she goes back to the boring stuff that means nothing.  I would say, if you like doing a buttload of busy work, then take her, if not - don't.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE THIS CLASS HUMOR AND IDENTITY!!!!!! she is really nice, class is really interesting. You have to do a few presentation, but they are very easy as long as you are prepared. The class is great, easy, and you learn alot!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is super interesting and I thought her exams were easy, even though I didn't read every single chapter.  She is a feminist, so if you don't agree with your viewpoints you might be uncomfortable.  She also bashes the Catholic church every now and then, but it's not too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2005<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teacher's I've had at DePaul.She made an interesting subject even more interesting.Her test are based on the book and lecture,so read! 3 tests,1 paper on a song,no quiz.Shes funny,and expects participation so offer an opinion, which should be easy,it's a class about sex and sexuality</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2005<br>Class Name: HUMANSEXUALITY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midge is awesome! Great professor and amazing lecturer. She brings humor to all of her classes. Don't let this fool you, you will have to study, but it is straight from lecture. Study only your lecture notes and get a B, study your lecture notes and the text for an easy A. Take Midge, she's awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class! She is a great teacher, class discussions are v. interesting, would take other classes from her in the future if possible. There are papers every week but they are easy and the readings are interesting, very smart woman and I got a lot more out of the class than I thought I would</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was awesome! There were some classic moments in this class. I would reccomend her to anyone. Three tests and one short, easy paper. The tests were more than manageable as long as you study.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome. loved this class and her as the teacher. she explains things really well, has a tendency to not want to be offensive to the point of almost being silly. misogynists beware. oh, and take good notes. it really helps.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2004<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was very interested in the subject so I enjoed most her lectures. Follows the book format. Tests are exatly what is taught in lectures, notes from blackboard, and book. Overall, good class, if you're interested in the subject you'll really enjoy it and learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVED this class. It is very interesting. Discussions were fun. She is lenient grader. I am so nervous to give presentations but this was a breeze.  Would definately recommend!!! She is a very nice and understanding woman.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Insightful and def did NOT come across as a &quot;rabid fem&quot;. I enjoyed her a great deal. If you need a ISP 200 class - take it! Grades easily on papers and presentation is a breeze.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2004<br>Class Name: PSYCH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor, a little too overly politically correct at times. Easy and very flexible grading wise. The people that don't like her are normally the conservative types (read what you like into that). Take her, she's awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2004<br>Class Name: PSY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arrogant.  Rabid feminist outlook.  Avoid her like the plague.  She thinks she owns the place and everyone in it.  Why do psychologists all seem to need psychological help themselves&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2004<br>Class Name: PSY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2003<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well...I took her discover class without really knowing what it was about. Be prepared for a lot of feminism and woman power shoved down your throat. She's an okay prof-pretty smart but so fidgety all the time. Her grading is fair.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2003<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2003<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midge,Midge,Midge. A very opinionated woman (arent we all) but often times she pushed it a bit to far. I dont think she realized that we are all entitled to our own opinions. Nice woman. A little quirky.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2003<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midge, oh Midge. She is a little bit of an anxiety ball. She can be lots of fun in class and brings up subjects that most teachers would not (&quot;I want to talk about the 'c' word.&quot;)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2003<br>Class Name: PSYCHOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor.
