She may not teach at DePaul often. Dr. Ebrahim may be a very intelligent professor, but the majority of our class was not fond of her. She disagreed with a lot of students' opinions. Her tone of voice and comments come off as very condescending. She is also a tough and unfair grader.</div></div></div></body></html>
