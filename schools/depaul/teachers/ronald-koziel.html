Knows his stuff inside out. The actual class is standard lectures and a midterm and instead of a final exam, he gives you a case study to do. The case study is pretty straightforward. Midterm is a bit tricky, but he lets you use a page of notes. Pretty fun class, would recommend professor for anything!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: TDC371<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy all around, really explains the material well. Took him for TDC 361 and 371, Got an A in both classes. Didn't buy or need the book, lectures are good enough to ace the mid/final. MR's are easy, presentation is easy. Easy and interesting class. Recommend it for sure!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2010<br>Class Name: TDCTDC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers there is at Depaul. Highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: TDC361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy assignment and very tough exams but explains the material well.  The exams are graded on a curve but you still need to study a little. Just read the textbook like a novel because it is dry and boring. Very Easy class to get an A or B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: TDC361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was nice and knowledgeable. I was worried because I am a liberal arts major, but I ended up learning a ton about t-com, and I didn't stress. He was pleasant, and I would take him again for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: TDC361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Koziel is retired from the telecommunications field, but he really knows his stuff. Enjoys class discussion on new technologies. Might be hard for some students who don't have a sufficient background, but anyone interested in technology should have an easy time in this class. Five short reflexive papers, midterm, final, and presentation.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2007<br>Class Name: TDC371<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Koziel teaches the material in a manner that allows you to understand it.  The workload is just right for the amount of material you have to study.  Although it is a challenging class, his methods work and I will be taking a third class with him next quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for BMS 125, 125 and 142.  I love him and out of all the math teachers that I have heard about he doesnt compare.  He helps you in every single way possible.. the breakdown of the class is clear and he tells you what is on the exam.  TAKE HIM.  p.s. im really really really bad at math and I got a B+ in 125, a B in 126, and an A- in 142.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2006<br>Class Name: TDC531<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher!  Very knowledgeable, subject-matter expert!  Allows students to concentrate on their individual areas of interest.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2006<br>Class Name: TDC361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very amiable professor. I knew nothing about the subject going in and was extremely concerned about my grade. Justifying a &quot;B&quot; as an achievement comment was threatening my GPA, but he graded on a curve...not sure if I needed to work so hard but it was the hardest &quot;A&quot; I ever earned!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2006<br>Class Name: TDC390<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ron is a *working* engineer in the industry, and has a great feel for the state of technology. Yes, he's an 'easy' A. Most classes (not just 390) are 5 media reviews, a paper/pres, and a final paper. Pay attention, you might learn something...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: TDC363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He definatly knows his subject, but he goes on... and on... and on.  Fairly boring.  Nothing we didnt already learn in TDC361.  I'd take Wilcox over him any day.  Still, a VERY easy class. Take him for a quick and easy A, and bring your laptop to class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2005<br>Class Name: TDC565<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher.

Lectures are boring, but he makes everything really clear! Homework and attendance are extra credit! He gives you what is going to be on the midterm and final! Also lets you take midterm if you didn't like your grade!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: TDC371<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Teacher.  Has amazing knowledge of the subject area.  Very helpful, and is understanding. He is up there with Wilcox.  A+ Would take again.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
