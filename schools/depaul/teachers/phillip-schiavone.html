Super easy, laid back, and very clear. Simple quizzes; exams aren't too bad. I took Business Calc I and II, he was that good. Aced both like a piece of cake!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a great teacher! It is not the easiest class, so you do have to work and apply your self but he is a great professor. He is helpful and lets class out if he gets everything done.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not at all a bad class. Isn't an easy A so you will have to work but he explains the material and does work through problems prior to quizzes. One quiz each week which he drops the lowest score and lots of homework. Do the homework and put forth a little effort and should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2012<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Schiavone is very clear with what he wants from students and gives examples before every quiz.  Just review before the quiz and you'll be ok!  Also don't procrastinate with the online homework because it's a big part of your grade and can help you out if you're not doing as well as you want to be doing.  Best math class i've had!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2011<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attend every class, do the homework and you should be fine. Utilize the free tutoring center or his office hours to understand the problems and you'll do well on the quizzes and exams.  Schiavone does a fantastic job of explaining problems step by step. Hate math, but would take him again. This is a marvelous math professor. Take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really helpful explains things really well when you have questions and during lectures.  there is a quiz every class or so, and alot of homework and its all online (don't buy the book, just the online key code.  you Do Not need the book.) Has a good sense of humor.  Well, I enjoyed it. Don't act like you hate math, it'll make it better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2009<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!
