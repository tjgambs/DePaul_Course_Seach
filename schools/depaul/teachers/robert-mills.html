Really the class is all about attendance, midterm, and final. The group presentation is easy. In order to do well in this class you have to read that text over and over again. The format of the tests are multiple choice but that doesn't make it any easier. Don't get me wrong I learned a lot but I wish my grade reflected that.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2009<br>Class Name: EIC123<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didnt agree with some of his comments on certain class material.  When I raised questions, it was as if he began to argue about it.  He brought in alot of OLD videos about effective commun. - all of which were very outdated and somewhat irrelevant. Be careful of body language, he reprimanded me one day, which is probably why he gave me a B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2008<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so funny. Paying attention in class is easy. Sit in the first row and stay attentive. He knows when you don't pay attention. Tests weren't too bad but you definitly need to study. No papers...one easy group project. Take him, he's great!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2007<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If he doesn't piss you off by the time of the midterm, you probably have &quot;good body language.&quot; Be very carefull in his class. He reads your body language to determine your grade, so make it look like you are extremely active in your group. He's quite annoying and has a bad attitude. If you take him, good luck...seriously. I can't stand him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2007<br>Class Name: CMN211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had this prof. last year and he was awesome! really funny guy and extremely organized with his notes. What he talks about is exactly what is going to be on the midterm. Went to class and worked hard but I got a B+</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall an okay prof. He was NOT very sympathetic when I had a quantifiable medical emergency and missed the midterm. Not too many chances to make up grades if you do poorly on the midterm, but he did tell this one annoying girl to shut up, which was very respectable. He does NOT deal with rude classmates or cell phones-very commendable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: PUBLICSPEAKING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Mills is HILARIOUS!  Take his class just to laugh at his funny/corny jokes. He sometimes makes fun of classmates which was so funny.  He's not an easy grader, but not hard.  He wasnot very clear on what was going to be on the midterm/final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: COMM<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures cover everything that's going to be on the mid term. You still need to read the book to do well on the final. Lots of memorization to do well in this class. I thought he was a pretty nice guy. Overall, I enjoyed the class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2006<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wanna be friends with him, he's just an interesting guy. His teaching style is kind of random, though - I would suggest being prepared to have to create a system for your notes after lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the guy who said &quot;prick.&quot; That's a great way to describe him. He has an attitude problem. He's just grumpy, ***hole. I don't know what his deal is. Class is easy, but dealing with him is not. Good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2005<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of those guys you will either love or hate.  As long a you put in effort at what you are doing he will give you good grade on you speeches.  You don't have to be a good speaker to get an A on the speeches you just have to try.  But is midterm and final are all from the book.  In order to do good on the test you actually have to study.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is really easy. It's not a blowoff class; you have to read the chapters in order to get an A. As long as you do that, you'll do well. I also have a high GPA and I got an A in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exams based on an easy pointless book. I do public speaking every day at my job and this guy thought I didn't know how to speak or put together speeches. He's kind of an ass and the class is a total waste of time. I got a B in a blowoff class like this yet I'm getting A's in all of my finance classes. Screwed my 4.0</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2005<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>COMPLETE JERK!  Talks down to students a lot too.   His test was ridiculously hard, and a few students had to drop after the midterm because of it.  I studied really hard for the test, and I still got a D.  WASTE OF A CLASS IF YOU TAKE IT WITH HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2005<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a real nice guy. The tests are based directly on the book, and he says that a hundred times before them. He's funny, and he genuinely cares about the students. This class is pretty easy.. just study for the midterm and final really well. Oh, and he always lets us out early. I would definitely recommend him.. great guy.. great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok I am someone who doesnt mind getting B's but this class I definitly deserved an A and recieved a B. I thought this was a pointless class and Id take it just to get a good grade, but this guy doenst seem to care about his students much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2005<br>Class Name: SMGRPCOMM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Mills is a excellent professor, he is not for the fainthearted. The exams are tough but you come away with a concrete knowledge of the subject matter. He has one hell of a sense of humor and I am glad I had the opportunity to take hsi class. I highly recommend this class for anyone who is interested in working in group dynamics.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My speech skills improved.it was an easy class and my speech skills improved.Easy grader on speeches but the mid & final were txtbook based & we never study the textbk in class.Its a really easy book you just have to read the chapters on your own.His grade scale is fair& lets you out of class early.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2005<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>do NOT throw the book away...you NEED to read, because the tests for this class are DEFINATELY out of the book.  Whoever posted last needs to wake up and pay attention in class...everyone who has taken this class will agree with me. READ THE BOOK or you WILL fail the tests!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His classes are really simple.  If you bought the book, throw it out.  Everything is based on his notes.  Go to class everyday and write down his examples given and your guaranteed an A- minimum. Just remember, dont read the book.  It will only screw you up.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2005<br>Class Name: CULMEDIA<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RUN away from this guy. FAR FAR AWAY. do NOT take his class. I repeat. Do not take his class. HIS TESTS ARE IMPOSSIBLE. Material isn't used properly.
