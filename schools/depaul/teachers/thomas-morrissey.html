Homework wasn't mandatory. Smart guy who knows how to explain things clearly, but the issue is that the style of the exam problems differ from the ones gone over in class which makes for a depressing test taking experience. Maybe that's why there's an optional research paper to try and get points from...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2013<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'd never taken an Accounting class, but Tom made this one interesting and engaging. The grade is 50% midterm and 50% final exam. We did group problems in class, and optional homework; they weren't collected. Tom treats you like an adult. He doesn't make you do the work. If you follow the syllabus, the class is EASY. If you slack off, it's not.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2013<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned a lot in his course and found him to be very helpful when necessary.  Textbook reading is a must. I'll second that his work experience adds utility to the course.  I also enjoyed that he has little tolerance for grad students that aren't serious about school.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had no prior background on accounting but after taking his class i have a fair understanding of the subject. Brings in real world experience into the class. Uses combination of lecture, in class assignments and homework. Exams are graded fairly, be detail oriented while answering problems, multiple choices are not straight forward. Good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy.
