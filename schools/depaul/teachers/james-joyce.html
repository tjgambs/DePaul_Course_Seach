Primadonna who thinks he's big time because he worked on the Snoop Dog horror movie that was straight to DVD. He desperately wants people to think he's cool from his glamour shot faculty photo to him playing his &quot;hip&quot; I-pod before class starts(U2 and the Metallica S&M album&#63; Give me a break!)
