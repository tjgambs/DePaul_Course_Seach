I basically taught myself everything from the book. Avoid his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2013<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely terrible professor. Can't understand a word he says in class. I won't even bother asking questions in class because the answers won't suffice either. If you like to teach yourself this class is for you otherwise avoid taking this class at all costs i'm about to rip my hair out here.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2012<br>Class Name: MATH135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pr. Krop is a very good professor. I really hate math and always have problem with it. I 've got B in his class. Just do the homework. The exam problems based on HW. Take him . You will not have any problems. If you don't do your homework and don't like to attend the classes...well don't try to get your education then</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class wouldn't have been difficult if he spoke English without such a thick accent. The man is extremely knowledgeable, but the language barrier severely hinders the learning experience. My advice is don't take a class with this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His accent is so thick that I'm astounded he was able to get a job teaching in English.  It boggles my mind that anyone is able to learn from him, unless they've already been exposed to the math he's &quot;teaching&quot;.  When I think about how I'm paying nearly $3k for this class it feels straight up insulting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2010<br>Class Name: MAT240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Krop was a great professor.  Math is a hard subject to teach but you can tell he tries to get students to understand and is willing to answer any questions.  I enjoyed is class and would definitely take him again.... He got his PhD from University of Chicago!  Come on now, you have to have a bit of respect for that kind of achievement</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2010<br>Class Name: MAT160<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The single greatest professor you will ever have in your life!! My absolute favorite professor. Yes he has an accent and speaks quietly, but his teaching was clear to me and he's really funny. Take him! I cannot express my adoration for him enough!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took a night class for MAT 135. Professor Krop is easy and can be helpful. The class grade make-up for my class: Final 45%, Midterm 45%, and Homework 10%. AND an &quot;A&quot; is 90-100%, a &quot;B&quot; is 89-75%, a &quot;C&quot; is 75-55%, and a &quot;D&quot; is 45-below%. You can get a 55% in this class and pass with a &quot;C&quot;!. All homework is graded and attendance is important.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Krop is a really great teacher- he is always willing to help and goes over things as many times as necessary until EVERYONE understands. Really sweet man and an easy grader. The study guides are really helpful too. I wish I could take him for every math class I need to graduate, to be honest. Sit in the front.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has an accent and speaks quietly, but if you sit in the front half of the classroom it's fine. His study guides are incredibly helpful. He explains most things fairly well, but there were a couple times I went to tutoring to get help. I would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: MAT149<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While he may be hard to understand at times, he's a very good teacher. the exams are exactly like the practice tests and he will help you during the test if you ask.  He's extremely smart and knows what he's talking about. I recommend him for calculus over the other teachers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2008<br>Class Name: MTH130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'd avoid him if possible. It's really hard to understand what he says and you'll spend most of your time teaching yourself the material. His study guides are helpful but he makes the material seem more difficult then it really is. All and all I would say save yourself the trouble and DO NOT take this class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2008<br>Class Name: MAT149<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awsome teacher, extremly easy grader. When it comes to Krops class the slightest effort will allow you to pass. This teacher wants you to pass. If you have a series of classes with krop you will see hes actualy quite funny.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2008<br>Class Name: MAT147<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although he does have a fairly strong accent, he is a clear teacher, who will extensively go over any problems you have. study guides are extremely helpful for the tests, and he is a fair grader. i would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2007<br>Class Name: MAT147<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accent, low voice, explains things he doesn't have to and it just confuses.

He explained each problem in painstaking detail and did everything possible to make sure every student was following him. I found this class boring, but that was the subject, not him. If you can't hear or understand him, sit closer to the front. I found him very easy to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2005<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was easy, but it was the single most boring class I've ever been in.

His class was like an hour and a half sleeping pill. But the tests were pretty easy. Also, the teacher talked down to us a lot of the time, he acted as if we didn't know anything about math, he made me feel like an idiot...but hey, I got a B, so whatever...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2005<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Krop spends a lot of time making sure the entire class understands. Tastes almost too much time making sure. He's always willing to answer questions. I didn't have any problems understanding his english. Study guides were helpful. Quirky kind of guy, but very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2005<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is hard to understand.
