GREAT professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2012<br>Class Name: SOC301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>From day 1 this professor grasps students' attentions. She knows when to be serious, and when to lighten subjects. Midterm and final are simple if you do the slightest amount of studying. Papers require some thought, but they're not research. You just need to have interest in the subject. Oh, and this woman knows her stuff. Awesome guest speakers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2012<br>Class Name: SOC301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice lady.

She's very easy. Midterm is easy, and there are two papers. Very easy grader. She does require that you go to court observation twice, but it's pretty interesting. We didn't even use the book all that much. I learned everything from her stories. She used to be a juvenile probation officer. TAKE HER! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</div></div></div></body></html>
