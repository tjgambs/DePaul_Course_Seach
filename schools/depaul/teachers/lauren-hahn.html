She rounds your grade down, then deletes the class on d2l so you can't see how many points you actually got. Then to top it off she grades things very tough and doesn't explain what she actually wants done for an assignment. If you need to take this class for credit, look for someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2015<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most awful teacher I've had at DePaul. It's a wonder how she's still employed. Grades harshly, extremely rude, and very condescending. It's impossible to get an A.

The work was't bad, final was fine. She's very judgmental and not understanding. She took off points for me not having an internship and telling her that I had no real business writing experience. Isn't that what the class is for, professor? You have to lie to make her happy. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2013<br>Class Name: WORD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She grades too harshly. Its hard to pay attention in class because she's boring. You could hear a pin drop in her class. no one really wants to be there and it shows because no one participates. she's a bad teacher. She's sarcastic and dosen't care if your point of view is different. she gets annoyed if no one says anything during discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated this professor. Very judgmental. Very strict. Very sarcastic. Very opinionated. If you don't share the same viewpoints as her, or if you come in late (or something petty like that) she will call you out and try to make you look foolish in front of the other students. This was one of the most unpleasant classes so far.

This is the worst english professor I've had! If she doesn't agree with your own opinion, she will lower your grade no matter how good your writing skills are. Not helpful at all! Makes so many sarcastic comments; it seemed to me like she hated us all. There are many OTHER and BETTER professors! she is not recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the worst teacher I have ever had.  Her assignments are not hard but her grading is awful!! If you do not agree with what she thinks she will give you a very bad grade.  She is not helpful because she doesn't remember what she told you and then marks you off for the comments she gave you as well.  Her comments are sarcastic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2011<br>Class Name: WRD503<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very strict about attendance, if you are 5min late she will call u out in front of the class. She rolls her eyes a lot. She can be helpful at times but i wouldn't reccomend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was honestly the worst teacher I've ever experienced at DePaul. She was rude to students and only cared about what she had to say.  If you didnt' write a paper that showed her side of the view, then you automatically got a C or lower.  Don't take her if you can help it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She absolutely drove everyone nuts. She will only see her side of things, and if you do not agree with her your grade will suffer, even if it's a narrative. Lots of busywork and uninteresting class. Stay away if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would highly not recommend taking her class. Super strict about attendance and participation. Brainwashes you with the Toulmin arguement and multiple rough drafts. Loves to argue. Lots of busy work and many assignments on top of the final portfolio. I ended up failing the class, and had to retake it with another professor and got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>&quot;The Honest Reviewer&quot; Pros: You can revised your essay... Cons: You can revised ONLY your essays and they make up only 20% of your grade. Midterm and final portfolio make up 60%. Quizzes make up the rest. Anyways, don't be creative in her classes. Follow ONLY her instructions and you'll be fine. I didn't. Overall, 4/10.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't recommend taking her, personally. I had a rough time with this class, and though I've always enjoyed writing and working with my writing she made it unclear as to why I was not doing well on assignments. I also disliked her use of the Sports Talk text book and her focus on athletics, as it was something not easy for me to write about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It should first be stated that I honestly did learn from her class. She looks for succinct and strong argumentative essays, but is very picky on what she thinks is a well-written argument. Students in my class were often confused with her expectations and upset with her harsh grades, but it's really rewarding once you figure out her system.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did well in her class, only because I was relentless and made an average of two revisions per paper. She's excellent if you're too brainless to have your own opinion, otherwise she's a horrible instructor. All I learned to do was summarize her exact words by the end of the quarter for a good grade. Great if you don't know how to regurgitate info.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't take her again.  Blackboard shows a good grade, which doesn't seem to figure into grades. Midterm and final grade are lower than expected, which seem to be based only on your portfolio and final paper. Update paper per her comments and she still gives a lower than expected grade. Look for another teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm a reasonable person, I always take these RateMyProf Reviews w/ a grain of salt, but AVOID THIS WOMAN. She grades poorly, does not give much consideration & fairness to work. Strict, stern demenour in class. Thought Id stick the class out, think shed make me a better writer, she didnt help @ all. Overworked, unfair grading, and a complete pain!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible. Grades on a bias, if you get stuck with her you better write with her opinion. Very rude and short with students especially if you are making a counterpoint to her ideas. Close-minded. Assigns too much work, there were at least 2 writings due a week. Avoid at all costs</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she really is NOT a bad teacher. actually, (i can't believe i'm admitting this) i have learned a lot in her class so far. she has high expectations but it's college. if you put fourth effort you will get a good grade. she gladly corrects rough drafts of essays before they're due, i've gotten all A's on mine by doing this. AND you can rewrite them!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easily one of the worst instructors I've ever had. Impetuous, petty, hot-tempered. Treats us all like we?re 5. Chews you out for any infraction big or small.  We all just ignore it now out of sympathy/politeness for whoever she chooses to berate that day. Doesn't teach how to write; teaches how to mindlessly regurgitate info from assigned readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very hard and grades very hard. Make sure you understand Toolman terminology otherwise you are screwed. You will work on papers and she acts like this is your only class! Good luck, shes VERY hard!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2009<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hahn means well, but I would not recommend anyone to take her. As a business writing class, you would think grading is based on formatting, but its based on content, something she systematically tears apart in her grading. If you make all of her recommended revisions, she still gives a bad grade. As a 2 credit class it is not worth a B-.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher i have ever had at De Paul. switch if you can. she is difficult to work with and has ridiculous expectations.

After conferencing with her, however, i realized that she is actually a nice lady with ridiculously high expectations.  While I did learn a lot, I would suggest you switch while you can.....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not as bad as everyone says</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher.

One thing said wrong, or one excuse made and you will get yelled at. She in unclear and doesnt explain the way she wants things done then yells about it when its not done her way.

I received an A in the class, but I worked my butt off for it. The thing I saw in my class was people still acting like they were in high school. If you didn't do the hw, don't come into class making excuses. She's not stupid. Do your work and you will pass easily.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very intelligent BUT I have to say was the worst teacher i have ever had in my life. She does not explain her directions clearly. Her rubrics would say one thing and she would expect the other. that class makes you work, and yet you wont get the grade you want. If you end up having her DROP THE CLASS WHILE YOU CAN!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, all these comments are true. She is not a pleasant teacher, however, she really teaches important materials that I have noticed other WRD 103 professors do not bother with. If you end up having her as a teacher, just do your work, and show respect. Also, ask for help if you need it. I suggest going to the writing center for her papers as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2008<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's intelligent and well read, HOWEVER, it is hard to get past her rude, condescending, dismissive, aggressive behaviour.

She plays favorites and has no issue belittling someone in front of the class. She will question the motives or intentions of students who miss class, and is generally very negative. and unprofessional. The value of the class is outweighed by the headache of her personality.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>How should I describe her&#63; Disrespectful. Biased. Evil&#63; Anyways, I just want to say that there is no way a teacher like this would still have his/her job if it was not for tenure.

I agree with the last comment. She loves calling people out, but hates being called out. She'll get real defensive if you go against anything in the text.
