However, his class is boring bc of the way he taught, like a reading machine. He grade himself! give you very specific feedback. In a word, he is very good professor even he is a little boring, old school.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2015<br>Class Name: IT231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had the opportunity to learn a lot with him, he gives projects every week so we can work with what we've seen in class, which is very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: IT231<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>You won't get an A doing the bare minimum in this class, so be ready to design 1-2 reasonable looking websites per week (CSS included). Not too challenging, just required a bit of work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2014<br>Class Name: IT211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for IT211, IT212, IT231 online, IT313. FANTASTIC prof. Classes are very structured so you know what to expect, ample time to complete each project, and for the tests, you are allowed a cheat sheet. There is also a practice test online that is very similar to real test. Will spend hours with you during office hours, accessible kind man too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2014<br>Class Name: IT212<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>His assignments and class is easy enough to do online, but due to the weather the class had some assignment bumps. He uses outside graders and reliably points to the tutor for help, which can either help or hurt your grade. Make sure you don't fall behind, and unlike the 2 previous classes I'd say take this one in person.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2013<br>Class Name: IT212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Teacher, very helpful outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: IT211IT212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Professor... just put some effort and he'll give you code.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2013<br>Class Name: CSC423<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't seem like prepared in the class...very unorganized and confusing.I completely counted other online resources to understand his class topics.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: IT211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Solid professor. You will come out of the class knowing a lot and he knows his stuff well. Standard midterm and final, study and you will do fine. Highly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2011<br>Class Name: CSC423<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I begin to love statistics because of this teacher. Steve is really a nice and patient professor. I'm an international student,and I just feel great to ask him questions and always get a good answer.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2011<br>Class Name: IT233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Jost is an extremely nice man and a great teacher. He was so helpful outside of class and very patient when I didn't understand things. He's really a genuinely nice guy and cares about his students. It wasn't my favorite subject but I'm happy I had him for a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are late with the projects, he'll do it wit you @ office hours. He really cares about his students. I never turned anything in on time and still got a B+. He lets you bring a cheat sheet for exams. I never got book or paid attention, just learned day before exam. VERY easy! Great Professor! Not to mention, his grading scale works in ur favor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class, but he doesn't make you do problems every week like other professors do.

He did does not know what he is doing at all in that class! You ask him questions and he responds by saying, &quot;this is not a math class, you just need to know that this is how you do it&quot; and he does examples gets the wrong answer! he is really a horrible professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class, he will show you the steps on how to do the homework.  Overall, class material is very boring, I counted about 40 yarns within 1 1/2 hours from different people but this class is a grade booster to your GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2009<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just an amazing prof. Super helpful. just attend class, he basically does the projects for you if you follow along.  6 projects (really easy). Midterm + final are simple if you study, i got  A's on both. theres a final proj, nothin to fret bout.  Very fair, actually tries to help. seriously take my word for it and take him.

TAKE HIM ...GPA BOOST</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: GPH205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are alot of assignments, but it's easy. He curves test and lets you use notes on midterm and final. He's an easy grader and gives you opportunities to do well in the class. I would recommend it b/c it's better than an actual history class. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2008<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest A at DePaul. If you can't do an assignment, he does it for you. Easiest grader. You can also steal others work offline and alter it if you want. Kind of a joke to be honest with you. Take it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2007<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was so stupid... I could add faster than he could.  He would constantly have to take out 5 mintues so he could reteach to himself what he was trying to teach to us!  I felt like his teaching methods were an absolute joke and I was offended to have had to learn from a guy like this!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's such a funny man!  Typical nerd, but really cool and laid back!  He's enjoyable and the class is easy - plus you are by a computer and you can surf the web when the class gets boring.
