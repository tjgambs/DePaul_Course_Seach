Though, for a 100 level class, this was brutal. BUT, it was still worth It because of his lectures which were so entertaining and informative. This is one class where I can really say I've learned many new things.  There is a lot of reading and he grades particularly hard, but its well worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Classes are interesting and entertaining but definitely way harder than the average 100 level class. Hes funny and enjoyable but is a hard grader especially on the large essay at end of course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2010<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely charming and excellent professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kurt is definitely a philosophy geek. He knows so much that it can be overwhelming for a 100 level class. His class can be interesting but you will definitely have to put in a lot of work. He is also a tough grader. I would not take the class if you are not interested in philosophy. I wasn't but I managed to survive :)!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2010<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Brandhorst is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. He talked all the time about how he didn't like DePaul and how he wasn't being re-hired, so hopefully he is gone. If he is still at DePaul AVOID him. I participated in class all the time, did all of my work and saw him during office hours and only got a B. I dont think anyone got As</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2010<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very nice guy, but like it was said earlier, I thought I was in a 300 level class! A lot of difficult reading and very hard to stay focused in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just dont take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a nice man, trying to be funny but his class was impossible. i took phl 101 and felt like i was in 301. he expects you to know more then he teaches in class. so far the worse class and prof...dont take him!!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
