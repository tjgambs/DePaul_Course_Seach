Easy A. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dana is a great professor who makes sure that her students are taken care of outside of class, she seeks out times to meet with students and if you reach out for help she will without hesitation.

I really enjoyed her class. She does make you read your stuff out loud to either the whole class or a small group, which can be intimidating and difficult at first. However, I think that was a good thing for me, because I was always shy and now I feel a lot more confident about my writing and what I have to share with the class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is awesome and so nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice women, young and still a kinda new teacher.
