She made class interesting by discussing current events that were important to everyone. I walked into her class not expecting much because I was taking this Freshmen class as a Senior, but I walked away with improved skills & new way of looking at writing. If you attend class, you will do well & benefit from her teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers at DePaul.
