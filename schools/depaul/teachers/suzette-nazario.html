Speaks fast, so listen carefully. If you're not confident in understanding take another prof or lower level class. Language learning was minimal, mostly cultural learning, and a few tips here and there about specifics in the book. Hw wasn't essential in grading. Study for exams to get an A!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was unclear, often assigned things and never returned to them again. She was easily distracted and never on course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: SPAN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a great teacher. She was willing to help you and stay after class to work through a homework assignment or even take time out of her week to study with the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2005<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i think she is a great teacher. she is very enthusiastic about the language and makes  her students feel the same way. her assignments are easy and fairly intersting, and her tests are abreeze. although sometimes she talks too fast, she is a very helpful and caring professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2005<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice lady, but class not very helpful. She was new, so not really familiar with book. Taught myself everything that I needed to know for the exams. A is not hard, but make sure you hand in all the homework cuz sometimes she forgets to ask for it. Very lenient with deadlines. Tests are slightly difficult since we don't learn much so study hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is very hard to understand at times; there were many times when people had to ask her to repeat in english. she was very unclear on when the assignments were due and when tests were going to be. the class was very unorganized and confusing! in a nut shell-- i should have stuck with Irena!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
