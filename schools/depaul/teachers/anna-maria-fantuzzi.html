I had her for my entire first year and she is amazing. She is always willing to help and doesn't always teach straight from the book. She teaches about Italian culture, which is nice. She is also the nicest person ever. I wish I could take her next year. Tests are easy. Getting an A is easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2013<br>Class Name: ITA103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantuzzi is by far my favorite professor at DePaul.
