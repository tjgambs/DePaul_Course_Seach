She is super knowledgable and really wants her students to do well.  She has the students run the class because she is interested in what we have to say and doesn't want to lecture us for the whole class period.  I would recommend her if you want to get a real understanding of the healthcare system.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: SOC221<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She expects the students to run class. When she was talking or showing a slideshow it was very interesting, but when she didn't it seemed like class only needed to be 40 minutes long because nobody was talking. Papers are pretty easy. She tells you exactly what she wants and if you don't put it she will grade harshly. Kind of boring but easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2012<br>Class Name: SOC351<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She definitely knows her stuff! However, she is picky on her papers and grades pretty hard probably because she wrote the text book used. She wants a title for every section you write the papers on otherwise you will get a C. Must show up for attendance if you do not want to end up with a C or D.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: HON351<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's okay.  Expects her students to run the class and doesn't seem to have answers for a lot of questions.  She enjoys what she teaches and grades fairly easy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: SOC390<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, not bad.  The class itself wasn't something that I had great interest in. As a professor, she really knows her stuff and is very knowledgeable. I found the class boring at times because of how mono-tone she can be.  She isn't a professor I would highly recommend for everyone, but I also wouldn't tell anyone to stay away from her either.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: SOC390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Budrys of the most informed and interesting professors at DePaul. She is always willing to talk to students and help with papers. She is truly a wonderful professor and I highly recommend her. I have taken Professor Budrys for three classes. She is great!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2006<br>Class Name: SOC351<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows what she is talking about and makes you want to learn. The topic was death and illness so the class was sorta depressing. You only have to write three papers. The topic wasn't hard but she is sorta a hard grader. I would recommend doing rough drafts of your paper and showing them to her before the final draft is due.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: INTROTOUSHC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Budrys is a brilliant woman and wants students to do well.  She is responsive to emails, and she is willing to meet to discuss/edit your paper.  She clearly outlines everything in the syllabus.  Overall, great teacher and interesting course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2006<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i hated this professor like no other.  she is rude and just flat out if you need help forget it.... i hate her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2006<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>professor budrys was so helpful.  very easy class and she realized it was an intro.  she gives you the questions that will be on quizzes a week before the actual test.  no final, just 3 tests (30% each) and 10% attendance.  she is a great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is brilliant, and knows her stuff.she really makes you think. just read the material given and you'll do fine. tests are straight-forward. class gets boring a lot, and she is a really low talker, so if you are hard of hearing like me, i advise you to sit in the front. good class overall.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: SOC351<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a wonderful professor, and is willing to help anyone whenever you need it. But my only concern was that I did okay on the papers, and she made me rewrite them in the writing center, and that's what I did.The worse part is that I followed every advice the writing center gave me, and it didn't change my grades on the papers. She is not easy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: UTOPIANSOCIETI<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring....</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: INTROHEALTHCAR<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear and fair grading.
