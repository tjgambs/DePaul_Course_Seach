Learnt nothing... This guys just copied those formulas from the book to the board without explaining...Exams are extremely hard to show off how much he knows, but not what we know... a typical academic guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: FIN662<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid!!!!

He is a pure academician who is teaching you a bunch of theories that you will never use in practice.  ex.  made us memorize formula for standard deviation!  Unwilling to give meaningful help even when askd for by multiple people.  ex. when asked for help narrowing definitions for final from text, he said, "they are all important"</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2010<br>Class Name: FIN525<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard professor, tough exams! Flow of teaching is pretty bad, skips through subjects w/out letting you know; lectures are long & heavy. too much emphasis on the formulas (have to memorize), too little concept explanation; not well related to real world. Did not bring work experience. Articles for exam essays are a horrible read! Would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: FIN526<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor definitely knows his stuff, but his teaching method mostly consisted of dumping info (two textbooks and fifteen articles) without relating much of it to real-world.  This material could be interesting if taught the right way.  I would try and take someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2010<br>Class Name: FIN575<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very very boring.  It's very easy to start day-dreaming after about 10 mins of listening to him talk.  Does not apply real world examples just boring math...Very hard teacher to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXTREMELY DIFFICULT! 8 pop quizes, drop the lowest. Midterm + final.  No Extra credits.  Quizes are HARD!! Hard grader! But if you listen WELL in class, do ALL your homework, don't procastinate, you will do fine.  He gives good lectures that cover the book entirely.  But if you are a book-person, it's challenging!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2006<br>Class Name: GSB420STATS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Gehr is the sort of instructor delivering the quality of instruction one would expect at Kellogg or UCGSB.  He is indeed very difficult and does use financials to demonstrate real world applications of the material, but is completely fair and will explain an issue at length if called on to do so.  His delivery does however sound like Ben Stein.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2006<br>Class Name: RISKMANAGEMENT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Donno, I think he is extremely hard. Talks slow, but even with that speed you get lost after about and hour of class :-(  Quizez you every week, on one little thing even though, the amount of material on the lecture was enormous. If you want to study untill you see dreams about Risk managment take Gehr.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: FIN362H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although a jerk, he gets the material taught. Everyone in class studied nights on end until the thin crush that develops on bloodshot, sleep deprived eyes stared to flake off. It is one class where you are pleased he drilled the material into your head.  Thought be aware, he is extremely strict.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: FIN362H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While he can speed through the material quite quickly he is a good teacher and I am learning  alot. I think exactly the opposite of the posting below me so go figure. I am a bit of a genius though so maybe my opinion is not the best for most when evaluating Gehr.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2006<br>Class Name: FIN362H<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Gehr has moments of brilliance and complete ineptitude. He is simply unable to bridge the gap between math and financial concepts leaving his students poorly prepared for exams. Dr.Gehr can deliver some insightful information here and there througoutlecture, however the majority of the material is rubbish and ambiguos.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
