Got an A- (I assume because of my final paper), but she is pretty straight forward and it is a very easy class. Take it</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, but not recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes extremely easy. Class seemed like it was ten minutes long. She lets you out early most of the time. Her style is interesting I would agree, but if your looking for an easy A take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's really easy...if you want a pretty easy A i suggest taking her...class is not all to entertaining though..but the papers are simple..rough draft, peer review, and revising..nothing too complicated</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's not as bad as they say. At least the projects are fun. Just being decently creative and you will get a good grade. She is decently helpful. And she explains the assignment well. And seriously who cares what a teacher wears.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Um, so um yeah. This teacher thinks  english is an art class.  Interesting assignments, but doesn't really teach you how to write.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a difference between and easy class where you learn and an easy class where you don't learn. This class was so easy and I learned nothing. I did all the assignment an hour before class. She says um like 1000 times in class. This class was a waste of money and it is my fault for not switching professors.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>English will be served spicy.....actually not at all. I can honestly say it was top 3 for the most boring classes of my educational career. She gives homework for basically every class session but it's easy, and I could never figure out for certain how much it was worth. Does a good job of preparing for the final paper, everything else=worthless.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
