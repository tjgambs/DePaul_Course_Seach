Not too difficult or demanding, but also pretty boring and requires a heavy load of busy work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In my opinion, Lu Zhang is an excellent professor.  He is very helpful and wants you to do well in the class.  His assignments are fair and as long as you keep up with the class and stay focused, you will do fine.  He also keeps the class interesting with his sense of humor.  Great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2013<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, funny guy.  Attend classes or you WILL fall behind.  The midterm was really easy and the assignments are from the book and are easy to do.  He definitely knows about the topic as a result of experience in the field.  I recommend taking him for IT240.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2013<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty funny guy, if you keep up with going to class and do the homework, you will be fine in the class. There is a midterm and a final project, just study and keep up and you'll be golden, definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2012<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lu is a good guy, has reasonable expectations, but the class is something you will need to keep up in. Not necessarily hard, but it speeds up as you go. If you put in a bit of effort, and PARTICIPATE, you should do well and enjoy class. Love his accent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Alright, cut to the chase, you have 6 assignments from the book and a midterm and a final project. This guys is a really really hard grader. if it was up to him he would cut points for misspelling your name. assignments, exam, final project are fairly simple but he will take off anyway. easy B but really hard to get A. to get A, need to be detailed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2011<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nicest guy. Funny. But I found that I was teaching myself all the work this quarter...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2010<br>Class Name: CSC549<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not sure how he is for other classes, but he really had very little knowledge of the topic (data warehousing). Anytime someone asked a question or challenged him on something, he'd get defensive or talk around the subject without really answering the question or giving an explanation. Takes too long to grade and grading is too subjective.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2010<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's only caters to students who know what he's talking about. The way he teaches is rather confusing at times and when you ask him to clarify he rephrases it to something confuse you even more! I have to rely on the book to pass this class which is unfortunate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2008<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Being a DL students I pratically begged him to give me 0.24% that I was lacking for my 'A' but he didn't. His grading for my final was flawed and he later changed the grading for one of my question after my explanation but instead of awarding all 3 numbers that he deducted, gave me only 2 which stopped me from obtaining an 'A' by merely 1 final #.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: CSC452<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am a DL student.  Great professor.  Jokes a lot.  Tries to get everyone involved in the course material.  He knows his stuff.  The midterm was pretty hard but he graded fairly.  Homework & take home final were difficult, but he gives more than enough time to complete the work.  The class is not over whelming and the professor is really good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2007<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Zhang makes a dry topic somewhat interesting. He is available outside of class and shows interest in you learning the material. Midterm was open book/open note. There were 4 homework assignments and a final project. Do the homework ahead of time so you can work with Zhang if you need it.  The final project will require some SQL coding. Good prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: CSC452<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had this professor a year ago when I took 451 and just finished his 452 class.  I think that he's a very good professor.  He's well organized and explains things very well.  I saw a negative post about him, but this guy must have failed.  I am a DL student and really never had any problems with any of my classes and I graduate soon.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have to be honest here, I had the BEST experience with this professor. He is very fair and balanced. He helped me out when I needed him. He gave extra credit assignment to entire class since some of us didnt do good in the midterm exam. He responds back to your email quickly and very friendly individual.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2006<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he was a good teacher especially since I knew nothing about databases he explained himself thoroughly.His test were okay and the final was a little hard to me but he did extend the deadline. He also stated that he would take longer to grade our finals he didn't just have us waiting and waiting he informed us of this. Overall I liked him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2006<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dude, this very very slow about grading papers... the tests are okay and will NOT make sense to you. so just fake it...and beg for extra credit. Do not take him distance learning - if you're in class, you can be his buddy and he'll let you slide, but distance learning students will suffer big time...</div></div></div></body></html>
