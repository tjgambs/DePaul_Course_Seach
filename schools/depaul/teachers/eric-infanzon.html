He makes the labs very straightfoward. He practically gives you the answer if you don't know it and always wants to give you a 100% in the class. I screwed up on one of the labs but he still gave me a 100% knowing I wasn't in the  dc majors. His hair is awesome too!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2011<br>Class Name: DC274<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whoever gave Eric a bad rating is fullretard. Eric gives everyone 100% on the lab if you attempt it. He takes work that is weeks late. If you obviously BSed the lab, you are still allowed to resubmit for 100%. Easiest lab class ever.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2011<br>Class Name: DC274<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whoever gave Eric a bad rating is fullretard.

Not hard at all, but that's because it's the lab.

This class is pretty challenging and a lot of work. It makes film into something scientific and lame. Eric is a grad student and is a pretty tough grader. He's a cool guy, but says some mean stuff once in a while. Just avoid DC 274.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
