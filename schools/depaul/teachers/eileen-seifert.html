Only 4 essays and a midterm/final portfolio were due. Good use was made out of the textbook and class was enjoyable. I would definitely recommend her for a first year writing course!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall not a good teacher at all. Her teaching methods are from the stone age and she spends every single class talking about things that are irrelevant to the major assignments. Not to mention that she is an extremely hard grader if she does not personally like what you are talking about. If you get her as a teacher, get out of that class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2012<br>Class Name: WRD300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly nice professor. She assigns a fair bit of reading, but it never feels forced or irrelevant; everything is tied into the big picture. Also, her feedback on papers is extremely helpful, amongst the best I've ever received (and I'm a WRD major). Love her and I hope to take more of her classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: WRD320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Seifert is such a sweet and caring person! The class on the other hand is a bit dull. She tends to go off topic and then you realize you haven't really learned much about health writing at all. But because she's so sweet, I'd recommend you take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2008<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the best teachers I have. She will have you write about 6 papers a quarter and be extremely helpful with her comments in order to make you, as a student, better. I would recommend to have her as a teacher any chance you get.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2008<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is easily the nicest professor I have ever had. She loves reading all sorts of ideas in your papers as long as you pick an argument and run with it. You can be creative--and even disagree with her--and still get an A. If it fits your schedule, take her class for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2007<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her classes are really fun, she is extremely funny and knows what she is talking about. class is pretty easy however she can be tough a little on grading papers. but overall i am glad i took her because she is a really cool teacher and hilarious</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2007<br>Class Name: ENG101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an amazing professor!

I didn't initially want to be in the class, but it worked out all right. She's very sweet and is willing to talk to you outside of class. There is more writing in this explore class than in others and the final project was long.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2007<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Seifert is a great person and a teacher. Her lectures are interesting and she knows so much that she will make you interested in whatever subject she is teaching. She is a pretty tough grader, but the corrections she makes are great. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a really nice and knowledgable professor but I hated the class! It was extremely boring and she didn't do much to make the class more exciting and interesting. She goes really in depth about the subject matter which I found unneccesary most of the time...but shes really into what she teaches. Good teacher, just boring but id reccommend her..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2007<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had Eileen as a professor and as a co-worker.  She is such and amazing person.  Her wealth of knowledge is uncanny and I wish I can be half as good a teacher as she is.    She is definitely demanding, but if you ever need help she's always willing to.  If your paper was less than stellar, she is willing to let you submit a re-write.  But you</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes a really nice woman and genuinely loves literature. However, at times i feel she forgot her audience and would reference things no 19 year old would have read yet. The group project sort of led to the works not being fully covered or resolved. not the best class discussion in my opinion. kind of dry.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman knows her stuff, and loves teaching it to you. Her experiences and cute sense of humor make it a joy to listen to her lectures. The class was such a boring topic, yet I managed to make it through the semester with some interest (surprisingly) because of her. I highly recommend taking her class. She provokes good discussion.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor.
