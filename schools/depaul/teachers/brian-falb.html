They're obviously the ones that are posting here.  Yes, he used PowerPoints but it's an Intro class. Come on. Some people whine about the professor when they should be looking at themselves. Prof. Falb was great. Expectations were clear, he's very fair, one of the better ones!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2007<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Falb was awesome. I wish he weren't leaving DePaul! his expectations were clear, he always was willing to meet with you if something didn't make sense, i really learned a lot from him. take him if you can!! you won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2007<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what the person below is talking about. Prof. Falb bent over backwards for us. Review sheets and in-class review sessions, his expectations were clear from the beginning. He's not easy but he's fair. The only reason the person below must have failed is because of him or herself because Prof. Falb is great!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2007<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY if you take pride in your GPA and your sanity.  This teacher pretends to express concern for his students, then screws them behind their backs.  The ****ulative final is a project (w/ a 30 p. paper, m.c.,4 short answer (each 1/2 page), 2 mid essays, 2 essays, and a PR plan. Imposible to finsih. Despite all effort, you will get a bad grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2007<br>Class Name: CMN337<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Falb taught some of this class. He was interesting, knew his stuff, and was organized.  He was also easy to talk to and explained things well.  He's a hard grader but he is very fair.
