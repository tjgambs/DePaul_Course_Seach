A lot of people slacked in the class because of his lax gradingattendance policies but if you give your best effort he really appreciates it! Awesome guy and he was full of knowledge. Took  him twice and I am always happy to see him on campus. Take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: 224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Denlinger is amazing! He is passionate about his work and is willing to help. His lectures are fairly long but his power points are interesting. He isn't a tough grader he just likes completed assignments. I took the class with no background in photography and i am doing perfectly fine. Fun class. Definitely recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2014<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Tdenlinger was one of the few art teachers I've ever had who didn't start out our class with still lifes (or ever bothered to cover them). And anyone who's taken an art class before knows how awful it is to always start w still lifes. Denlinger was enthusiastic, had amazing lectures, and great group discussions that made this late 6pm class rad af</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2014<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is very overwhelming if you've never drawn before, but Denlinger is always willing to help. Not hard to get an A if you ask for help.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: ART224<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>He likes to ramble on a lot. You could walk in halfway through lectures and not miss anything. Assignments are usually short and easy. I never took a single test, but there's a final paper. He's not good about explaining the basics. You'll probably need some previous knowledge of cameras before you take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2013<br>Class Name: ART221<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible at explaining the basics. I've been into photography for 4 years now and seem to know more than Tom. Would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2012<br>Class Name: ART224<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am in his BEGINNGERS photography class and he is treating it as expert level. Horrible at explaining the basics in anything. I think the only positive is that he doesn't mind pushing back work. Analysis papers are useless. Only recommend if you are an expert in photoshop, I'm still confused about it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the 2nd class I've had Tom for and he is NOT a good teacher. He waste a lot of class time setting up things (like still-life). When you ask a particular question he does not explain with clarity. He also does not hold you accountable for things like attendance, which makes it easier to be lazy. I will not take a class with him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2010<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was a complete waste of time. Learned nothing but how to cut out stencils and glue them on paper. Felt like I was in kindergarten all over again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2009<br>Class Name: PHOTO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tom is great! But I wouldn't take his intro class unless you have taken photo in high school pr something because he is not good at explaining the basics. It was fun and most of the time I didn't go to class and just did the work in the photo lab whenever I had time. I got an A :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2009<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class consumes a lot of time. Be prepared to hand in a project/assignment on a weekly or sometimes biweekly basis. There is too much assigned for an introductory art class: 1 paper, 1 final, 4 projects (with parts a & b), and tons of additional assignments.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
