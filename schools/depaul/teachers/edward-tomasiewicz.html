Thats all i can say, one night we were expected to read about 100 pages of text. Not very easy to get in touch with either, and didn't open the D2L page. I'd say of you need to take any religious dimension classes, look elsewhere, trust me!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: RELIDK<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Ed is a great professor.  I found him very interesting.  His classes are 100% lecture though, so if you don't like that, probably not for you.  His exams are very short and pretty easy.  He doesn't assign homework except for a 30-45 page journal due by the end of the quarter on chapters from the text book.  It's not that bad.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2013<br>Class Name: REL245<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are looking for a class with a NICE professor who teaches a fulfilling class, this professor is for you. The only problem is he is hard to communicate with outside of class, and has a small final based on A LOT of notes. Even though he is a  nice guy, his teaching methods are horrible and he should probably stick to the church.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2013<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away from this teacher. he lectures all through class. his mid term and final should be easy but it's 10 questions on 100 pages of lecture notes which is impossible to remember it all. The class would have been better if he was more engaging. Homework is journals for books that are boring and are never discussed in class. avoid this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2013<br>Class Name: RS220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE teacher.  He assigns an absurd amount of reading per night accompanied by a summary.  He collects all of the summaries at the end of the quarter, leaving with not idea what your final grade will be until it is too late.  Yes, is lectures can be interesting, but so not worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was one of the most fulfilling classes I have ever taken! I think everyone should take this class, it will benefit you as a person no matter what your major is.  I learned SO many crazy interesting facts...most of them are from the required books though, there is a LOT of reading so beware but WORTH IT!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: REL250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's one of the best professors I've ever had! He keeps everything so interesting and is so helpful. You can tell he really cares about every student and makes sure everyone is enjoying the class and the topic. He uses humor and anecdotes to make his point. There's a lot of work in the class but there's no way you won't enjoy his class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: REL256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was amazing!  He isn't one of those boring teachers who reads from a book or ppt. The only downside is that four books need to be purchased and that there is a lot of work. There is a midterm, final, book report (7pgs), journal (30 pgs), and a presentation. I recommend taking his class, he is really entertaining and nice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2010<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dont know what these last two people are talking about. He is one of the greatest teachers I have ever had. He makes you think critically in new ways, and is the most caring professor you will ever come across. If you want an easy blow off, don't take him. If you want an awesome class where you will learn new stuff all the time, then he is for yo</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2009<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Father Ed is the best!!! His lectures are at times sidesplitting, and always intriguing...good chicken soup for the soul type stuff. But please, please do not leave all of your journal assignments (ends up being 30 pgs worth) until the last week!!!!! All of the reading and writing was worth it just to hear this man speak twice a week.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: RELI220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Father Ed is a great professor, he was very down to earth and tried to make time for his students to meet with him. I would recommend this class to anyone Father Ed is really an intelligent man who knows a lot about religion. The only downside to the class is the journal entires which are a lot of work if you leave them to the last minute.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2009<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice professor, almost always lets class out early. LOTS of reading and journals... not HARD work, just a lot of it and you'll hate yourself if you leave it until the last week.

His lectures are interesting and short. Almost always dismisses class early.  Will give you extensions on all assignments. Final and midterm were only 10 one word answer questions. Only downside.. a lot of homework. A  1 1/2 page self-reflective journal for everyday. But I highly recommend this class and professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2009<br>Class Name: REL256<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everyone says how great he is but I have one word for him UNFAIR!. midterms are fill in the blank from his own words/lectures. Books are only used to write huge 30 pages of journaling and one book was completely out of date and hard to read. If you like journaling and can show up to all of the classes go ahead and take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2008<br>Class Name: REL285<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor mostly lectures during class, but the content is very interesting.

Best class I ever took at Depaul. He is a super nice teacher who wants to see his students succeed. Attendance not mandatory, midterm consist of 15 questions, final, and simple presentation. Homework is heavy w tons of reading but guaranteed a good grade and knowledge after this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great guy and it was interesting, but it's all lectures.  He never takes attendance, but if you miss a class you miss lots of notes.  There's a ton of reading and it never really gets talked about, so you forget to do it.  Interesting but lots of work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2008<br>Class Name: REL256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED HIM!! Went into religion class thinking hard work, lots of paper, hard midterms but it was completely opposite. He makes you write in a journal and make presentations and an easy midterm and final. There is lots of reading and you learn a lot from your readings. TAke THIS CLASS!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2007<br>Class Name: REL256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>absolutely loved him! You read 3 or 4 books and write about them in journal entries. Do one presentation project and a midterm and final. He scales the grades. Very easy to talk to as well. Lets you out of class early and class was canceled several times due to his health issues. Seriously, take this man atleast once before you graduate depaul!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2007<br>Class Name: REL256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this man. Truly a genuinely nice person, so so understanding. The topic was so interesting and Prof T is obviousy very passionate about what he teaches. I am definetly planning on taking  more classes with him in the future.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2007<br>Class Name: REL256<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really great teacher and you will walk away with a lot of great tidbits of information you can use in your everyday life. Midterm/Final are 10 &quot;short answer&quot; questions which may mean one word. He tends to let out early or class is canceled due to health issues. Nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2007<br>Class Name: RELSECT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Save yourself the trouble, 30 page journal, 7 pg book report, 3 books plus 1 novel to read, midterm, final- all for a REL requirement. The textbook isn't readable, he doesn't seem to care that we can't read it. I left lectures more confused than I was prior to coming to class. Nice guy though...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2007<br>Class Name: REL213<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice man, hands down. Class structure- not great. Pure lecture/ note-taking. Journals- sometimes up to 50 pgs reading! Not fair esp since its an elective for the infernal religion requirement. So love him and the lessons learned but the material in the texts were useless. Oh, and only take if you are Catholic or Christian or you'll feel left out!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was awesome! The teacher is really sweet and nice. He has a great sense of humor! Overall the material is interesting, along with his stories to go with it. He is very understanding and the course load wasn't too much to handle. By far the best professor I've had! I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome teacher, class is pretty easy if you do the work..one of the best and nicest teachers i have ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: REL256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good class, real good professor..take him if you need a religion class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful man, very easygoing. One mid-term, a final, a 10 page paper, and a minimum 30 page journal for all the readings in the books. Buy the books, you'll need them for the journal which is 40% of your grade. I hate writing extremely long papers, so I wouldn't recommend him, but his class was not so bad.  Attendance not an issue.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2006<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Adorable old man. He is a good, kind teacher. He really cares about his students and in turn, you learn to care for him a lot. If you do the readings (even at the end of the quarter like me, haha) you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't be mean.  He's such a nice guy.  But, the class is a little stale.  Ok, it's outright boring. Journal on these 3 books and not once discuss them in class.  If it weren't for the journals, they wouldn't be worth buying. Buddy up with someone, and share books.  He's super nice, unfortunately he's super boring as well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2006<br>Class Name: RELAIDS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof T. is fantastic! It may be hard for some students to listen to him because they lack an attention span, but if you do, it is well worth it. He imparts a wealth and depth of knowledge beyond the average professor. It is truly a pleasure to listen to such an honest and caring humanitarian.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: REL256<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Heres the class, a ton a reading for the first five weeks and you have to journal after each assignment. He lectures during class about abstract concepts that really make you think; i liked that part. The 2nd half of the quarter is presentations every day! so its super easy if you can keep up with the work for that first half.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a good guy, but his class was all over the place.  Once a week, I felt like I was on a bad acid trip. He didn't stick to the point, and every day was just him lecturing on and on, with no discussion or student interaction.  His class was the most boring I've had and made me want to never take a REL class again.  His grading was inconsistent.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2005<br>Class Name: WELLNESS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2005<br>Class Name: PSYCHANDREL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a great man.If your open minded you will learn alot from him.He will teach you about way more than just the subject your studying.He is for those who appreciate wisdom.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2005<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely did not want to take religion before taking this class. The father was an excellent professor.He answers all questions about material.He dismisses class early.He has an amazing personality that is colorful. I received a b in the class and i put in minimal effort so if you are smart you'll exceed. I highly recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was so informative!  He really knows his stuff.  He is also very respectful of students and of their individual beliefs.

He's very funny and very smart, very easy going. He usually let us out about 10 or 20 minutes early, and the readings weren't that easy or interesting, but if you talked to him I bet he would let you do something different in terms of assignments. Highly reccomended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2005<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, this class seemed pretty easy and I managaged to get A's on pretty much everything, but I mysteriously ended up with a B+ and when I tried to find out why, he never returned my emails.

He is gone often and rarely lectures. You are required to give a presentation, but he doesn't even take notes while you present. Tests are only ten questions and super easy. Not an exciting class AT ALL.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2005<br>Class Name: REL256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are thought provoking. It's a very interesting class if you're looking for answers of some sort. Yes, it is easy and all, but that's not what concerns him. And to be honest, it shouldn't concern you either. It's what he says and what he talks about that makes him great. I recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2005<br>Class Name: REL256<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well...the class is alright.  Some of the reading is boring so it is easy to fall behind.  Not very clear on what he expects on papers, journals, etc.  Over half the quarter is spent on students' presentations, which is totally ridiculous.  He's very nice though, and his lectures are interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2005<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor i have ever had, yes the class was boring, no attendance required, but i recommend going.

His tests are not really difficult, but challenging.  A lot of the students turned in very late work, but do not take his kindness for weakness.

Reads from notes and does not like open discussions. His tests are ridicuous-e.g.&quot;2 questions will be from 1 of the 4 books that you read&quot; How do you study for that&#63; He does curve tests & accepts homework really late. Oh-and he is name dropper and insecure. You have been warned</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: REL254<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The biggest waste of money.
