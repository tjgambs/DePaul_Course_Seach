The class was an excellent structure and practice in creating business plans and discussing the entrepreneurial process. I would appreciate if he updated his examples and ideas to reflect more modern sources - many of his examples are a bit old school.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2007<br>Class Name: MGT570<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Welsch is a terrible professor.  He taught absolutely nothing the entire quarter.  This class requires so much busy work, including the review of case studies from the 1970's which are totally irrelevant to starting your own business.  The text book was only used once, and the guest speakers were also irrelevant.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2005<br>Class Name: MGT570<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy brings in great speakers that will help you better understand the entrepreneurship environment.  The prof. does not do much teaching but mostly referencing.  He is also pretty boring.  You can bet a B+ without much effort but there is a bunch of work that you have to do.  Overall a great class if starting a business is in your future.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: MGT570<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>MGT 570.
