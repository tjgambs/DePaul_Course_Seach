This class is laid back and he is an easy grader. There are 4 speeches and 2 are group presentations, usually you get to pick your topic. There are also easy reflection journals and discussion posts. Challenges you to challenge yourself.  No textbook needed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was super easy.

His class is always entertaining and he challenges you to challenge yourself. Not that this class is hard or has any quizzes or tests, but he is one of the few professors I have actually met at DePaul that truly cares about your future. TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2014<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Wayne is the MAN!
