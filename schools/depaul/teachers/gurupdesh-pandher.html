Maybe cutting down on the homework would make the course less demanding.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2008<br>Class Name: FIN562<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learnt a lot from his class. Slakers wont like him, but he is a very good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2007<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is by far the worst professor at DePaul! He cannot explain for the life of him, half the time his back is to the class and he talks to the board; he is very effective at teaching himself, but no one else. He is condescending and can be down-right rude and insulting at the drop of a hat. He made the subject completely boring and tedious.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not great at explaining, sometimes gets upset at clarifying questions in class or ignores questions.  Had to study a lot on my own, relied on book more often than lectures.  Does care about teaching his students.  After we came to him as a class and told him we were confused about material so far he slowed down a little and class got easier.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2006<br>Class Name: GSB425<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>After complaining about the midterms not reflecting what is covered in the book, I was informed that this is his first time teaching this course for the Business school and that he was 'borrowed' from the Math department to do so.  He struggled to express the concepts to the class and then the exams were difficult and usually focused on one area.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2006<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a waste of money.  Teacher is horrible, he spends 40 mins doing a problem to realize he messed up, erases a couple of numbers, THROUGHOUT the problem (doesn't explain how he messed up) and continues on.  His slides don't make sense...just adds his spin to the already produced book slides.  So find those and read.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst professor I have ever had! DO NOT take his class. He makes no sense - talks in circles...I basically have been trying to teach myself from the book...which is awful and very cumbersome. I have no idea why this guy is a teacher. Im sure he is very smart - but he should just be doing research - NOT teaching!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2006<br>Class Name: ACCT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although it seems to be talking to himself but his knowledge is immense. He is a learnerd person. Keep up the good work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: FINANCE337<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We he lecutres, he is talking to himself.  Only he can understand what he says.  Has absolutely no teaching ability-I wonder how he has had this position for so long</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: FIN337<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst teacher you can have in the school of commerce. He blabs on about what seems like something but in reality is nothing. Avoid him at all costs. A waste of money and a waste of time. One never really knows what grade he will give either.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2005<br>Class Name: FINANCE220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this was proffessor pandher every week: &quot;blah blah blah, students do u understand&#63;, blah blah, this is not quality work, blah...&quot; yuck! this class sucked , do not take this. it messed up my gpa and know i dont think that i can be a banker anywhere except midamerica... eww.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: FIN337<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Acts like he doesn't want to be there.  He isn't very helpful and hard to understand.  Take Luft or someone else.  I got an A on the midterm and I still don't feel like I learned anything I just had a good cheat sheet.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2005<br>Class Name: FIN337<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is hard to understand and doesn't really act excited about teaching.  I understood futures and options from Finance 340 but he totally confused me.  I had to use another futures and options book to understood what was going on.  I recommmand taking someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2005<br>Class Name: FIN337<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher, but comes from a highly quant background. If you don't know math and at least the basics of options, I wouldn't take this class. For me it was easy and fun, but most people dropped before the final. Overall, difficult class but worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy.  Hard to understand and get used to his teaching style at first.  But, if you stick it out, he's not bad at all.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
