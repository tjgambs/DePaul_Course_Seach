But he was not very helpful. He forgets things he says a lot. He missed an entire chapter that was on the Department administered test. I would not take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>I took Quantitative Reasoning II with Professor Hasan.

I just took his class in Truman college, and even thought at first I sucked in math I got clear A. He explained everything, and he answered all our questions. I very much recommend his class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2013<br>Class Name: MATH99<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed Mr. Hassan's class. He is very helpful and genuinely cares about his students. I am the worst with word problems and he made it so easy showing step by step process. He also brought humor to the classroom. I never dreaded going to his class. I wish he was teaching 118.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor is a nice guy, but  his class is the first class where - after completing all homework and understanding the material I had no idea what to do when it came to exams.

That however didn't compensate for his exams being completely different from what he teaches.  I've never had a test where - after doing all the homework, and understanding the material - I had no idea what to do on the test.  I wouldn't recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2012<br>Class Name: MAT456<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is great in Teaching</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
