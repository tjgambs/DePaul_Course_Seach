Lots of assigned reading, some of which is pretty dense, but he did his best to make it clear. As long as you do the work and readings with some effort, show up to class, you will do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>:-)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2006<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty cool, if you ask me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to take an easy class, don't take this one. It seems like everything is easy, but then--wham!--you start to get your grades back. Eek! Don't take this class unless you want to really work. Participation is important.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok the class wasn't that interesting. but com on. its philosophy. i mean he did his best to keep us awake. He's a cool and smart guy.He assigend some very complicated readings but i barely read in that class and managed a B. there's just 2 esays and an essay final. u just gota work your ass of on those 3 essays you'll be fine. Even if u dont read.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has no clu how to explain the material. Really i think he is too a smart for his own good. I really did not learn a god damn thing from him. But the readings he assigned were hard but if you read them a few times you might get it. Just show up, take his quizzez, do the work and you will easily get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2005<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Granted, the class itself was very boring, he made sure to explain things thoroughly if someone didn't get it, and overall it turned out to be a good class, though i wouldn't want to take another philosophy class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2005<br>Class Name: PHILOSPHY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really hates this class. one of worst classes i ever took but i mean it's nto teachers fault. theres nuthin he can do aobut it. It's the subejct that sucks not the teacher. he's a cool guy and he tries to make it as easy as possible for us and lets us do a take home test. Just subject very very very very boring. highly dont recomment takingthe cl</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a little anal about things, but if u do it his way (not hard at all), u won't have any problems. Lots of reading, and journaling (pointless), but tha's part of the class.  Kinda boring but if u participate, u'll get on his good side...which means a good grade for u. I would take this guy for this class over other professors any day</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2005<br>Class Name: SOPHSEMINAR<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's a cool guy and very very smart. there's way too much reading,and its not interesting. i wouldn't take him again</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is really good and is very helpful.

There was a lot of reading to do but I honestly never opened the books. He discussed the chapters. Students also presented the chapters each class period. The quizes and final are take home and if you take notes you will be fine</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: SOPHSEMINAR<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him for my sophmore seminar and was not impressed at all. I learned nothing and majority of the work we did seemed pointless.  I was better off not going to class because he confused me more after he discussed the readings.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class wasn't bad.  Two essays, four homework assignments and participation.  I hardly participation and got a B+.  Lectures are boring and its a lot of reading.  Attendance is mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2004<br>Class Name: PHIL200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, if you want to read 30 plus pages do them. (I sincerely put in an effort but then gave into the ease of sparknotes.com) His quiz method was b.s**t. He is nice when you have a conversation, but he fails at keeping interest for the rest in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was such a great teacher. If u raise your hand and say something, anything about the subject matter, he really gets into it and you wont get bored at all. He is helpful when it comes to the exams,he tells u wht u need to get an A and he's soo cute!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: PHILOSPHY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The teacher is REALLY boring just make sure you go to class because attendance is MANDATORY. Tests are essay questions and he goes over the questions that will be on the test with the answers so you should have no problem.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This wasn't a bad class at all, it was really really boring. You get 3 in class essays, and he gives you the tipics before hand. Make sure you add your own opinion into the essays you'll definitely get an A if you do that. I never read and still got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really is a nice guy and was helpful when I needed it.
