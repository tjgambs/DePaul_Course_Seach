Discussions are what make the entire class and are generally tamed by her... usually pretty worthwhile or significant depending on classmates who speak. She doesn't really explain why you get the grade you get, and grading criteria is not explicit either</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like reading hundreds of pages a week this professor is for you. She's nice and down to Earth but she's a tough grader and thinks she knows it all. She likes to call people out in class too which is super awkward </div></div></div></body></html>
