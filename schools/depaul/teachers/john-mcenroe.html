Be ready to learn on your own. Make sure you do homework, he calls on students for credit. As for the exams, based straight off the homework, easy if you know what you're doing and study the homework. Definitely Recommend! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2013<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. McEnroe was not a very interactive and engaging professor. The class was pretty easy though if you are willing to put a little bit of effort in. Overall though you probably will not get much out of the course itself. I did a lot of studying outside of class, which was helpful but I would have liked to learn a little more in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2013<br>Class Name: ACC3045H<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a very average teacher. You either liked him or you didn't. He was very passionate about accounting. I was very confused in his class and basically memorized the homework answers for the test not knowing why the answers were what they were and got an alright grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2011<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm the same guy as the 304 review, so I'll keep it brief. There's a lot of stuff you have to memorize, but it's doable. Sometimes he can be confusing but if you need help go to his office, he's welcoming. I got my first A in acc off him so just study and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not the smartest in the Strobels program but I worked hard to understand the homework and notes and wound up with a B. Mid/final is pretty much understanding the HW and notes. Unlike a certain other prof, McEnroe is pretty helpful. There's a curve. Take him if you can, be relieved if you have to.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>John McEnroe is amazing!

Participation is based on answering homework problems in class but he puts the homework answers online so there is no reason you'd get the answer wrong. And even if you do get it wrong he gives you credit if you tried! Tests are just like homework problems...there are no surprises but make sure to go over the homework before!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2009<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. McEnroe is pretty cool, fairly easy class- calls on students for homework/participation grade, midterm and final that are heavily based on hwk problems assigned.

He's fair in his grading.. notes are probably not as clear as can be but as long as you do the homework, you'll be fine.. he's really understanding.. and overall, just a nice guy.

Take him... you will get a lot out of the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2007<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very simple course.

Knows a lot about accounting and the business world in general.  His lectures are not very clear and his notes are hard to follow because he's all over the place.  However, as long as you do the homework he assings class notes are not necessary because tests are just like homework.  Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best teachers. PERIOD.  I am not just saying that because I got a good grade.  He is helpful, cares about his students and respects them.

Makes it really easy for his students to learn and understand the materials. Need an &quot;A&quot; then take him. As long as u know the homework u know the exams. It is really hard to find a professor like him. Do take him as he makes everything go for it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/04/2005<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>McEnroe is the best and that is the bottom line!!!

He actually made me rethink my intentions of dropping out of accounting. Do the homework or at least look at the answers before class and be ready to answer a question. He is funny and actually makes it interesting. The tests are hard but he gives partial credit.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: ACC304HONORS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok. I agree with most of the comments, but here's the thing. McEnroe, at least for our class, goes too fast during his lectures. Important lessons aren't understood very well. The book is helpful and so is he if you ask questions. STUDY OFF OF THE HOMEWORK QUESTIONS!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>JUST DO THE HOMEWORK</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!
