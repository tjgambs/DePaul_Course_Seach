This professor should not be a professor..he is unorganized, rude at times, and unhelpful. Waste of money.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2009<br>Class Name: MAT240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for Precalc...worst teacher you could ever possibly DOES NOT know what he's doing or at least how to teach it. wich is the main objective..this is obviously not his specialty area and it amazes me that DePaul assigned this man to precalc which isn't easy in itsself.

He will loose for forget to record your assg. so keep track of them urself. He forgot to show up on the final day on time and told all the students to put the grade we wanted in the class on the back. I know D students that got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2009<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I question Prof. Florek's PhD. I could never correctly answer a students question. The study guide he gave for teh midterm he answered 5 questions incorrectly. He changed the final 3 times while we were taking it. This will be a complete self taught class with no direction as to what you need to learn. He will add hmwk Q's to already turned in assg</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2009<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is unreal and you will live in the tutoring center. He gives on avg 90 problems per week. He then changes the assg. after you've turned them in. He doesn't use the book to teach but the tests and hmwk are all based on it. His lectures are impossible and he will pick on certain students. If you can, take another prof!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
