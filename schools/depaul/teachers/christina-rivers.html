Her students want objective history rather than actual narrative, while Dr. Rivers entertains ideas, she is very matter of fact. She does assign plenty of reading -- so do the reading, this is college.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Sophomore Seminar with her, the material is really interesting and not too challenging, but I found her criteria for the assignments really hard to fulfill. When you do assignments, be sure to focus more on fulfilling her (very specific) criteria than communicating your ideas or she'll take off lots of points for petty things!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst classes I took at DePaul.  She's a great teacher and knowledgable, but the class structure is a joke, and the wording of the questions for the discussions is nearly impossible to decipher sometimes.  I was interested in the 1960s before this class, but that interest has been effectively crushed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2012<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my favorite class freshman year. READ READ READ! Prof Rivers was great though! Gave me great knowledge for my other law classes :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2012<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Rivers is awesome! very knowledgeable. Do the readings!!!!! Hard grader, but just keep up with readings and pay attention in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2011<br>Class Name: PSC218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. is okay. Class was a little unclear at certain times. Have two debates, 5 analytical summaries of readings that are collected at random, and a final. She is a tough grader. Final was just ridiculous. This class will take up all your time</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the sophomore seminar class: democracy/dissent 1960s. Very cool material, however Professor Rivers seemed apathetic about teaching the course. She is an extremely hard grader which seemed unfair given a number of reasons. Cool woman but awful class structure. I'm sure her upper level PoliSci classes are a lot better.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2010<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor, lectures are interesting 9/10 times. MUST READ: pop quizzes really help or hurt grade. Overall very nice and knows her stuff. Would recommend her -- esp. if not PSC major.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2010<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is alright. Reading was essential to the class; pop quizzes are a portion of final grade. Exam seemed impossible but grade turned out okay.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Rivers is very nice and intelligent. However, do not miss many of her classes because she will penalize you greatly for it. Also, be prepared for a lot of reading!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2009<br>Class Name: PSC330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The prof is awesome from the word go....Intelligent, beautiful, and challenging. Worth every penny. Class is engaging and writing is pertinent and enhances learning of the topic.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Rivers talks a lot and seems a bit over the top.  She is ridiculous when grading papers and can easily get on your nerves.  MLK/Malcolm X class was interesting but she seemed very biased..clearly</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2008<br>Class Name: PSC365<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Your average professor, lots of reading, fair amount of work. Sometimes things could get confusing, but she explained the best she could if asked. Take notes, READ the material because you never know when you will be called upon.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: PSC263<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I mean she is a lot more tough then before. I still appreciate her style of teaching. I just hate the whole doing brief/group thing because I felt that was POINTLESS. It was a lot more work then i had expected but I did gain valuable insight from her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Likes to talk. Alot! Sometimes  gets confused in what she's saying, but corrects herself. Her analogies are easy to understand. Likes to write on the board, but writes big. Talks fast though. Her grading is pretty good. Dont procrastinate ur papers, but if u do, its okay, it'll be around B. Tests are a bit scattered. Does a lot of book reading.nice</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2006<br>Class Name: PSCABD218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, lots of reading but they are only to help your do well on the final paper. Likes participation. Very helpful and is willing to clarify anything you don't understand. Good sense of humor and easy-going. Great professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2006<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2006<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's horrible at teaching this class. She's never done it before and she should never do it again. She  couldn't be more confusing. Lectures suck and she's ridiculous about grading. The only thing I've learned in that class is how to hate her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: PSC393<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a good teacher, although I think she does require alot of reading and writing. We had 5 discussion papers, a 5-7 page neighborhood survey (we had to compare 2 Chicago 'hoods by actually going out in the field), a 5-7 page proposal and a 15 page final. As well as 115+ pages p/wk. for reading. Overall, a good professor and good grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2005<br>Class Name: PCS120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Since you have to take PCS 120, take it with her, she tries to make it easier and as long as you really study hard for the mid term and final you will do good!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a nice teacher, I wasn't the best when it came to my papers and she helped me and met with me. I tried hard in her class, and though I deserved a lower grade she gave me a good grade! Fair teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's alright at teaching, but needs to loosen up, especially in the way she writes her syllabus- if you want to get a good idea of what kind of teacher she is, just read the syllabus and go from there... and she's just a tad ridiculous about papers...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2004<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she keeps class really interesting. tends to lecture a lot yet when she goes off on a tangent, it's an interesting one. i ditch classes somewhat frequently but i always attended this one.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2004<br>Class Name: PSP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She lectures most of the time, her exams are reasonable, but she grades assignments WAY TOO HARD! She's extreamly demanding about turning gramatically PERFECT papers, and if you have a single error, she'll deduct major points off your grade. Overall OK</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Rivers is very nice, but you must attend class and do the homework. No tests, but you must write 1 page summaries on the 1 hr movie you just watched and write 2 eight page papers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2004<br>Class Name: EQUALRTS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of reading, very knowledge about the subject.  fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2004<br>Class Name: MLK<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Rivers is one of the best instructors at DePaul.  If you do the work, you will learn something.
