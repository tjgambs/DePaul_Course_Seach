He lets you redo assignments by end of quarter, only need the one book for last memo. Took it at night and usually got out early.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2013<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I had MKT376 with Drew on Thursday nights and I still thoroughly enjoyed going to class despite it being thirsty Thursday - yes, he is that good. Top 3 professors in my college career and probably the most valuable class that I will use towards my professional career. If you turn in your assignments on time, you will do well. AWESOME PROF!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2013<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I definitely learned some things in this course. Come to class, you learn from each other, attend the networking events...I loved this class. This course helps you to prepare for (business) life and it's not hard at all! Take the class!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Drew is a young nice guy. He is a new teacher and is still learning. You will receive by far the most amount of paper work in form of slides- none of which are on D2L. No grades there either. The professors who teach this class are supposed to be charismatic, strong speakers but he is not cut from the same cloth. Easy to get an A. but value? Nope</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor and know how to build incredible rapport with all his students. I would definately recommend taking his class, if possible. Very professional, yet relevant. I like the way allowed redos an virtually every assignment. If you fail this class, it is solely reflective on your effort.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2013<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Depriest is passionate about what he does and uses real world references to help students learn. He is young and knows a lot about what he does. The first day he played Calvin Harris during break... Take him!!!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
