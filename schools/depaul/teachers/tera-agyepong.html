Cool professor with a good sense of humor. Lots of reading but interesting topics and class discussions. My eyes have been opened to a lot of different topics I never thought about. There is a final paper and weekly reading responses.

One will most definitely work for the grade. This won't be a walk in the park. If you are looking for easy avoid her at all cost. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2015<br>Class Name: LSP 200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class requires a lot of work, readings every class along w/ responses. Participation does matter and she takes attendance every class so be mindful of that. She's a nice teacher, have to give a presentation in this class at some point. She likes to call on people who don't talk much so pay attention!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures were straight from the book words for word.  Her powerpoints had barely any words on them and her quizes consisted of multiple choice questions where there were more than one right answer, but you had to choose the most correct one...I love history but this class made it hard for me to enjoy learning about it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor, inspiring and very intelligent.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
