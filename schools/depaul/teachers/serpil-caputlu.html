However, she lectures based on the instructions given from Mylabsplus. Homework is online (as usual), in-class and several online quizzes, excluding tests. She does review before the test is given, which is helpful. On the other hand, get ready to work hard since college classes are not easy A. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2015<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>First she goes over PPT slides and show step by step solutions on the board, then she solves more problems from the textbook. She is very nice and helpful. If you go to her office hour, she spend her time to answer your questions. She does daily quizzes to make students ready for tests. She always answer student's questions during class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>The daily quizzes are easy since you can work in groups and ask her for help. Lectures are pointless but if you have questions then it's good to go. As long as you do the hw and follow the steps shown in mymathlabs you'll be fine. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2015<br>Class Name: 135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div> She is very organized and includes the course calender in her syllabi with the dates of the quizzestests.  She does some daily quizzes as group work, and do review before the tests. She answers the students questions. She give office hours and stay longer if students needed. She does power point presentation and solve extra problems on the board.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>All of the homework is done online through mymathlab, which includes detailed instructions and examples, and allows you unlimited tries to get a 100, which is nice. However, expect to teach yourself all of the material in this manner. This instructor only spends about 15 minutes giving muddled lectures. The rest is dedicated to confusing quizzes. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Couldn't understand anything she said. Easy class because she uses mymathlabs and that is how I learned everything. All class I would sit on my computer and do nothing. Did not need to listen in class to understand material. Go to class, do homework and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady, she just wanted everyone to get a good grade.Going to her class is mandatory but it was pointless.I just sat on my iphone the whole time and got an A because she makes it that easy. Quizzes are like 30% of the grade and theyre open-notes and w/ a partner. Uses MML which is great. Just do your homework and study for the final and get an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, I regret taking this class.  She cannot teach but has us use mymathlab which is useful.  She occasionally confuses herself and does not respond to emails.  Unless you have no other options I would go with another teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very nice lady. Her power points are almost completely pointless, but just do the homework and you're fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Homework doesn't take long to do, mini quizes before each class that are straight from the homework.  Majority of the class retook her because she was so easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never been that great at math, but had the easiest time.  Just show up, do a little bit of the homework and you'll be fine.  Over half her class received an A</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
