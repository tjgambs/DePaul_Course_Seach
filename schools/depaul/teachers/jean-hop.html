I took it over winter intersession in 3 weeks. SO boring, tedious, and frustrating. Professor Hop doesn't answer emails. Still worth it though. I worked my butt off and got an A. DO NOT take this class if you are lazy or looking for an easy A! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2015<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>I took Database before at Depaul during night class. The teacher was good but I bombed my final thinking I would still pass cause I did well all quarter. I didn't pass. So I retook it with Kalayta online (terrible) and now with Mrs. Hop. She uses all her lectures, quizzes and homework from Kalayta verbatim. She is bad</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2015<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor's first time teaching the class, didn't look at the presentations that were made by another professor. Corrected things on the midterm well after many students turned the test in and left. If you think something was graded wrong, email her and bring it up. She'll give you points back.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take here period. Doesn't explains well and at times doesn't even how what she's doing. (  looks for the student for answers). I learned more in the book than her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Death by narrated PowerPoint. She also does video walkthroughs for some assignments, although aren't extremely helpful for when you have to do a similar question on your own. Not very speedy with grades, many times grading assignments after the test had passed. Does not respond to emails. Also has a tendency to word test questions wrong.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor ever. She doesn't respond to emails until after the assignments are due. She doesn't explain anything, her videos aren't even her. She has no passion, she takes forever to grade things and will test you before you get HW grades back.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2014<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The online class was very disorganized. It was probably because d2l was being updated though. The class just requires participation and that's basically it. The material is very interesting. She's a nice lady and just wants college level material in your work. She also emails back super quickly which is always nice. I would recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2013<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>She's a beast!! Take her!! Really nice! Finish all homework in class! Helps all students with their questions even if it takes 30min. She even stayed after class to help students! Wonderful teacher I would love to have her for any class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this as an online class. Prof. Hop was quick to respond to my email questions and provided individual feedback. The material was not always clear, but if I worked through a module (watch the videos, etc. first) then it made sense. Her emails back to me were always really encouraging.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken other online math classes and she is by far the worst professor I've had. Her instructions are awful, she won't respond to questions about assignments until after they are due,and expects a lot when grading quizzes and assignments. Don't take her unless you already know how to use access and excel.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I have ever had.  Doesn't respond to e-mails, doesn't know what she is teaching, gives confusing instructions, unorganized, video clips don't work, etc.  She shouldn't be allowed to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2013<br>Class Name: CSC281<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2012<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful, lively professor that will make you love the subject. She grades fairly and the stuff assigned in class is straightforward and overall pretty easy. Take her... You won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a wonderful professor who'll keep you engaged. She's super nice, easy to talk to, and will make this class enjoyable. Make sure you're there on time and that you participate in class discussions and you'll have a great experience! There's a paper for the midterm, online quizzes, (fun) current events articles and an online final. So chill :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2012<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best! Down to earth and is willing to help you in any way that she can. This class is based on powerpoints no textbook. Quizzes are take home, midterm paper and take home final. She makes the class interesting and her teaching techniques are modern. She's the best, hands down.</div></div></div></body></html>
