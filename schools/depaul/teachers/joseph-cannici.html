Final exam was tough and the information was more than human ability to cover. on-class final exam was bad decision from JEO. do not expect me to save hundreds of pages in my mind.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2010<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've had. Makes dry material as interesting as it can be and is very thorough. Homework was fairly tough and exams weren't easy, but you're allowed notes. If you're willing to be a good student, you'll do well and learn a ton. If you're looking for an easy class with little work, don't take it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very rigid especially to distsnce learning  students. For example, Joe will not share comments on midterm and final on COL for DL student and will require you to visit during office hours. Get serious Prof. If I can visit depaul campus why would I take DL course</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2010<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is good technically but very bad academically</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2009<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe is very knowledgeable in subject area.

This is supposed to be a basic survery course, but in reality is loaded with a ginormous amount of useless content.  Homeworks/media reviews are easy.  The exams were entirely retarded though.  There were too many questions that weren't even covered in class.  Whatever.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good at explaining concepts.

I will take other course with him, you learn and it is not so bored like other course.  He knows his courses and he wants you learn it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe is clear and pretty funny. The subject is pretty boring, but he makes the class fun with his occasional jokes and stories. Grade based on midterm, final, 3 HW assignments, and 5 Media Reviews. The final and midterm's are a bit difficult, the rest is easy. I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2007<br>Class Name: TDC460<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Homeworks are easy.

His class structure is very easy.  5 1-page media reviews, 3 HW assignments, midterm, and final.  The HW and media reviews can be done anytime prior to the due date.  If you have a tech background, take this online.  If you don't, definitely recommend going to class and asking questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2007<br>Class Name: TDC460<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really enjoyed taking his class.

Even though the material is kinda boring, he makes it easy to understand and adjusts grading if it is needed.  Some homework assignments can be tricky, but he will try to help you as much as possible - he wants you to succeed.  If I could, I would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2007<br>Class Name: TDC460<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You had better know something about Telecomm before taking this class. GRADING IS HARSH and there is TONS of information, so much so that we normally go a few minutes past the time class is supposed to end.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2006<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent instructor.  Extremely enthusiastic about teaching and helping students learn.  Makes every effort to be clear in his instruction and explanations.  Easily one of the best I've had had at DePaul.  Highly recommend him.  Course was interesting - I had no prior background in  Voice/Data Networks but now have solid fundamental understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material is dry and boring, but he manages to make it much less dry and boring. He really enjoys teaching and it shows. His tests and homework are straightforward and easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2006<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He had a cool personality but for some reason I could not get into this class.  The material was dry as a bone and he had about 100 powerpoint slides he went over each week in class.  I was totally tired of turning in homework every week.  If you are really into voice and data take this class if not you will die or boredom.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2006<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cannici is an AWESOME!!! professor. He makes the class be alot of fun. Gives very clear lecutres and will pin point exactly what to study for the exam. He lets you use a one sheet of paper with notes. When I took the exam I really didnt need to use the sheet of notes. His homework assignments and media reviews are really easy. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2006<br>Class Name: TDC460<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really good professor. His class is a piece of cake, but you must know something about the subject before you take the class. Grading is really good. Take his class. You will enjoy it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2005<br>Class Name: 425<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A pretty easy course. Fair grading on tests. If you're looking for a good grade and obtaining mediocre information on the topic of telecommunications this is the class for you. Joe is a pretty nice guy as well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: TDC361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this course as a distance learning class.  I didn't think the class was too hard, but it is not a subject I am interested in at all.  His test are fair and the media reviews and homework assignments are very easy.  Not recommended for people that have no clue about telecommunications.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: TDC460<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows his stuff about the material.  Exams very fair and not difficult.  Very passionate about this subject.  If you ask him a question, he will give you a very indepth answer.
