Provides a lot of extra credit opportunities. I'd highly advice you to take advantage of eduspace.....and do the quizzes on it. A 10 question quiz every week but they were easy if you studied. Midterm and final questions were similiar to the quizzes taken and on eduspace. Just keep on with the reading and you'll be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2007<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i really, really enjoy her. she genuinely wants her students to succeed and understand the material so if the class is confused, sometimes you can convince her to push back a quiz. the iclicker can be a pain in the ass but at the same time it helps her gauge how well the class understands what she's teaching. i really liked her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2007<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had her for 101 & 102.  Treats you like you're in high school.  Makes you buy and use stupid I-Clicker.  Waste of time & money.  She gives extra credit b/c she can't teach and grades reflect it. Avoid if you want to learn acc. Gives tons of handouts that are powerpoints from the text. Assigns too much HW as busywork. You'll end up teaching yourself</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a great professor.
