When you get a test back, it will be covered in check marks & loop things with no explanations or correct answers and a (what seems like random) amount of points taken away for each problem. I tuned his lectures out & read the book & I got a better grade than when I was listening to him. Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2014<br>Class Name: MATH136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Goes through material way too fast.

Very knowledgable on the course material and explains it very nicely in class.  If you pay attention, take notes, and do the assignments you will get a lot out of his class.  I would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2013<br>Class Name: MAT101MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He speaks with what can only be described as a half Italian-half Middle Eastern accent.

Can't explain theory, makes tons of mistakes, and has trouble articulating basic concepts. I basically taught myself from the book. His handouts and teaching are awful.

He is very helpful. It seems that any students who did not do well in his class try to blame him for their failure.

But I no longer see a point in even attending class. I dont understand him, the accent is rediculous. I tried, I did. Failed the classes because of his inability to teach. it's sad because I had higher expectations for DePaul. Because of this class, I am transfering. I refuse to pay out of my pocket, for a class like this.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2011<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher.

He is easily one of the best math professors I've had. He's always willing to help, gives extra credit, and curves the total grades.

Yeah, his accent is a bit hard to get used to and understand at first, but you get used to it quickly. He really wants to make sure you understand the material that's being covered.

He offers TONS of extra credit, drops a quiz, and has very helpful powerpoints for every topic. I just started BMS126 w/ a different prof who is disorganized and only uses the chalkboard.

If people have a hard time with his class then they are most likely undedicated and lazy students. Seriously, this guy couldn't make Calc any easier and has many opportunities for extra credit. He also provides review guides, review tests, and numerous activities to help the student pass.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2008<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very nice person and relaxed in the classroom. I have always been a terrible math student, but even though his class was very fast-paced, I did well throughout. Sometimes the material can feel rushed, but online resources are a BIG help.
