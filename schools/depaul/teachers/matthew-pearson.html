He's knowledgable, easy-going, and fun. I wish he taught more classes because I would take all of them. We had a party for our final too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: WRD205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Matthew is clearly interested in literacy studies. However, the class involved 15 scholarly articles, 16 blog posts8 comments, a midterm, a final, and a class presentation. He never lectured, but more so facilitated class discussion. By that I mean he wrote questions on the board and then we talked about them in groups then as a class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2015<br>Class Name: WRD205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Pearson is a really nice guy and his class is very self-directed. He assigns great articles for each class and is good at facilitating meaningful discussion. He promotes a relaxed and chill atmosphere, and he's pretty funny as well. Seems to always be in a good mood. Is always willing to help out with tests and the final presentation. Great class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2011<br>Class Name: WRD205<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do NOT get fooled by the other reviews. This professor is terrible! He DOES NOT teach. He makes the students teach the class while he sits on his bottom using his ipad. The midterm is super hard and he is so picky with everything. Plus he makes you meet with him twice for 30 min and it's a wate of time. Save yourselves, do not take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2011<br>Class Name: WRD396<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pearson is AWESOME! I loved this class. Definitely the most interested class I have taken. It was a lot of information, but it was so cool to learn about. No midterm no final, just a couple papers. Totally worth it, I wish I could take this class again!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this prof.  He wrote a song for our class and performed it, and was overall hilarious.  Very helpful, I hate writing but he made class fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2010<br>Class Name: WRD396<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best teachers that DePaul University has to offer. He is laidback and his assignments are useful and relevant, he is not strick on homework. His lectures are truly captivating and he can make even the most uninterested learner interested in the subject matter. Take him if you want to learn and have a great time in the process!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy teacher.
