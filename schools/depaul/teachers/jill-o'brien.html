You take 5 quizzes and she drops the lowest 2, a pointless paper about consulting firms, a midterm, final, and article summary paper and she's a hard grader, so don't take her unless you need a class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC355<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class is very repetitive, felt like I learned more by reading the texbook than I did by going to her classes. You take 6 quizzes(2 are dropped, a midterm, final, and two papers. While it seems like a lot, once you start working on it all, it's not too bad. You can miss up to four classes throughout the quarter when usually it's two.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She told me she used to be a dean and wanted to get close to the students by teaching.

She is an extremely caring person. She will help you with any topic (class related or not.)She loves what she teaches and you can tell. Sometimes she yells and gets into her speeches, but that is what keeps you interested. Class work is light and easy- I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS356<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very intelligent and obviously knows what she's talking about but is a terrible teacher. She is demeaning and is extremely unhelpful. Enroll at your own risk. I made the mistake of taking her twice and I will never do it again. If you don't mind being talked down to, this is your kind of teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: CMN315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I made the mistake of taking her twice.She's annoying, thinks that putting slides on BBoard is the work of the devil, & very nit-picky on the stupidest crap.She assigns & expects you to start work on final project 1st day of class(seriously).By end of course you'll have about 40,000 handouts.Just not a good prof at all.

You take notes all period long. Doesnt use blackboard and at the end of the quarter has two major assignments and final due, so you're left trying to guess your grade. If you can deal with that then take her class because it is really interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2007<br>Class Name: INTROCMN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Having taken other CMN profs, I am sorry to say that this woman is probably the worst. She did not help with any questions, and nothing was interesting. Plus she sounds like a cartoon character and thinks she's funny when she's doing it.

She mentioned many times she does not have much time because she teaches so many classes and other students.  Material is so-so, tests are not hard if you study - paper grade was a little harsh, and yes she does have a very high pitched screachy voice that she tends to use when telling a story...very weird, actually.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2006<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked this class because we got to talk in group circles but the teacher was unbearable sometimes.

She seems like she is goign to be really nice at first, and then she just kinda goes insane.  This is a public speaking class, and there were some excellent public speakers in our class who basically failed, she is not clear about what she wants accomplished by the class and this leaves her students really confused.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: CMN211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher--tells a lot of stories to help you understand the concepts.

I think she is a very nice lady, though and she teaches good stuff.  She should just work on that temper a bit.

Funny lady, and willing to help if you ask. Yes she gave a lot of personal stories, but they were funny, and helped explain the topics. There was reading, but geez, its a college class!
