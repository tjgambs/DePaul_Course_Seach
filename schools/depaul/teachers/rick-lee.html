He breaks it all down for you and as long as you keep up his exams are doable, i will not say easy because they are not. He totally engages the class and makes it fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2011<br>Class Name: PHL293<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, Very helpful. Interesting and engaging. If you have to take a philosophy class at depaul take it with this teacher. not an easy grader but fair, just put in time and show him you are trying and you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2010<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hilarious professor. Can't say I've left the class knowing any more about philosophy, but I enjoyed my time in the class.

Would recommend this prof to any DePaul student - PHL major/minor or not. Wildly erudite and REALLY funny - let's just call him gifted. He does have high standards and wants you to write well, but will work with you to make sure you perform up to your potential. Class was fascinating every session - very rare at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2006<br>Class Name: PHLMED<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a trip.......... had him real early in the morning for medieval phl... funny guy... ill give him that.... interested in his subject.... def....... good teacher, fo sho....... class wasnt that bad just dont be a jerk and go to his classs.... gots mad jokes... that make you wanna pee your pants.... literallly</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2006<br>Class Name: PHL382<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class always started out great with video clips of comedians or prof. lee doing his own stand up which always produced a lot of laughs. However, when we went into the material .... he was unable to provide clarity which sucked especially when writing the 3 papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2006<br>Class Name: PHL361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simply Stated.

He gives helpful insight for the papers, and makes sure that everybody participates in class and understands the material.  He is not a teacher to take if you feel like slacking off; be prepared to work, because Prof. Lee makes it enjoyable and worthwhile.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2006<br>Class Name: PHIL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2006<br>Class Name: PHIL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>okay...he is not that funny. his jokes are lame and immature. no cleverness whatsoever. and stop swearing. it doesn't make you a cool teacher. it makes you look like an idiot. especially when you smoke everytime. i literally fell asleep every single class. he is a tough grader. it is his way or the highway.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2006<br>Class Name: MEDIEVALPHIL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is in my top proffessors of all time. Very clear, Very funny, and very approachable. Even if you dont liek philosophy youll wnat to go to his class cause hes one of the few teachers that is actually a good orator.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate philosophy but his class made you stay awake because he is hilarious.  He explained to us how exactly he grades.   If you do all you need for a paper youll get a C, if you go above what you NEED and do more...thats where the Bs and As are. I got Cs on all 3 papers, but got an B in the class. Ask about the Vodka/Nikes border adventure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: MEDIEVALPHILO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Lee is AMAZING, not to mention flippin' hysterical. Even if your interest does not lie in Medieval thought I would suggest taking this course & see how your feelings change. He challenges, not forces, you to think, which in philo., is a nice break, plus the added side convo's about consuming obscene amounts of nicotine, booze and greasy food!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2005<br>Class Name: MEDIEVALPHIL<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lee is hilarious, and his lectures tend to sound like a stand-up comedy routine, albeit a good one.  Very knowledgeable, but if you argue with him he'll try to humiliate you and usually succeeds.  Easy grader and fair (if it seems like he hates you he'll still grade well).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2005<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Lee is great. I have no interest in this subject at all and he made it easier to understand. Just 2 small papers & 1 big one. Not a hard grader, I didn't know what i was talking about n i got B's on all my papers. Don't plagiarise, he'll catch you & fail you. If u r new to PHL take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you don't love Lee, you're crazy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very funny guy and made lectures interesting.

He's also very concise about his lectures.  He always has a very relaxed atmosphere and knows when to throw in a crazy story or joke when the class is dead.
