You will become a better programmer afterwards, even if you never have to implement BFS or shortest path. Marcus is an expert in the field, and works hard to help his students understand the material. Algorithms teaches problem solving theory that will help you for the rest of your career.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2014<br>Class Name: CSC412<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really a very good professor I have ever met in DePaul. Very helpful and smart. It's a graduate level class, so it's not easy although it's a intro level class. But you will learn a lot from him, he is actually really great!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2014<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Class is very difficult for an intro level class without prior coding experience. Even then the class is a bit difficult. He does give a lot of EC opportunity on home works and Labs are graded easily. He's very difficult to follow in class (he has an accent and speaks fast) however his office hour sessions are VERY useful and recommended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this professor! He is very confusing, goes very very fast through the material and makes it really difficult for just an introductory class. He is very tough on homework and exams, he considers it cheating if you do homework with a friend or get a tutor. He is absolutely horrendous.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marcus is just a horrible professor especially for teaching an entry level Computer Science class. He rushes through everything, by typing and talking way too fast. He also thinks some of the things he says are just common knowledge. In short, AVOID TAKING HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a lot of knowledge but goes at an extremely fast rate. If you took classes about programming previously you'll understand. If you're taking this class for the first time you'll have a lot of trouble. His handwriting is difficult to read when he gives feedback. Again moves too fast and most of it you need to teach yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2011<br>Class Name: CSC233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His midterm was just simply fun! And not hard at all! Just DO NOT ever share your homework with anybody else in the class-he will catch you. He's very knowledgable person and really nice to talk to. Lectures were a bit boring, but attendance is not mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: CSC233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Schaefer is a great professor. The class was difficult, but that's something I expect in college. Homework was 50%, Midterm 25%, Final 25%. I will definitely take other classes with Professor Schaefer in the future.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2011<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable person (has a Ph.D), but absolutely horrendous teacher. His lectures are extreme boring and the only thing amusing about him is his German accent. He also has very stupid homework policy that considers doing homework with friends or getting help from a tutor as plagiarism.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2010<br>Class Name: CSC440<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Cryptography and I thought it was the best class I have had so far at DePaul.  He speaks English just fine, better than a good percentage of the students. He is a hard teacher but I appreciated that. I learned a ton. Most of the comments on this board are from children who have not yet realized they are in COLLEGE now!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2008<br>Class Name: CSC440<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wish I had read the reviews before taking this class, everyone was right about him.  Absolutely the most insane professor I have ever met.  Several hour homework assignments, and ridiculous exams.  Should be exiled from teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2006<br>Class Name: DC270<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For this class, not a bad teacher, not as bad as the other reviews state (maybe just because the class was so interesting). He knows what he's talking about in regards to Horror Movies and is a pretty interesting teacher. Does give ALOT of homework but isn't an extremely hard grader. Quizes were easy, tests required thought (essay tests).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2006<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE,HORRIBLE,HORRIBLE TEACHER.. I CAN'T DESCRIBE THIS TEACHER IN WORDS.. he is very unorganized, is not very helpful..his lectures are toooooooooo fast.. you have to be a programmer to keep up with his speed.. And he makes you do alottttttttttttt alot alot of homework..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2006<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE teacher...dont take him...very unclear and makes you do a lot of work...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2005<br>Class Name: IT1301105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher, in my opinion. All you have to do is good work and turn it in ON TIME.  Sometimes he goes abit fast in the lectures, so pay attention and be prepared. He gives feedback and extra credit points for extra efforts with his weekly homework assignments.  Overall, I'd take him again...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2005<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are chicken enough then don't take a course with this professor. All you have to do is not miss any of his lectures and do all of the homework, and you'll get a guaranteed A. One midterm test which is easy if you take enough time to study and one final project which is not  hard at all you devote enough time to do it. So don't be a SLACKER.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class.  Weekly homework assignments, 1 midterm, and 1 final project.  Attendence isn't mandatory, and the teacher is helpful.  He does have a very light german accent though.  So he will pronouce data as 'dater' but who cares</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2005<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just out right horrible teacher. Can't wait til DePaul fires this guy. Needs to learn how to speak english also. (area= arerer)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good but need to be more clear in his subject</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really not the type of teacher you want for this kind of class. REALLY BORING. Too much homework for this kind of class and there's no chance you're gonna do it with what he teaches. Self taught. Avoid if possible. (Pronounces Data and Dater)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher! Doesn't teach the material well. Basically a self-taught class. And homework is very hard. Very knowledgeable professor, needs to teach graduate classes, not intro classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2004<br>Class Name: CSCXXX<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely intelligent, clear presentation of the material.  Absolutely THE BEST professor that I've run across at DePaul ... When taking for a theoretical topic, be prepared to learn a lot and work hard, but the payoff is enormous.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2004<br>Class Name: PROGLANG<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2004<br>Class Name: PROGLANG<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expectations are very high but yet the matrial is not understood very well from the classes.
