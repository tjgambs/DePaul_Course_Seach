Professor Abraham is very interested in studies and takes a rational stance on every issued covered. He was a little awkward at first but his lectures remained very interesting and students who probably speak out in their other classes, speak out in Abraham's class. Plus it was a pretty easy A and the course load was consistent.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2012<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite professor, made Plato interesting which is quite an accomplishment. Also he is a prolific scholar and a very nice guy. YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIS CLASS. Very interesting and not hard to do well in. We even watched the Matrix and related it to philosophy, great class!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2012<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Abraham is hands down the best professor I've had at DePaul. His class was heavy on Ancient Greek literature, but he helps you through it. An extremely easy grader and really knows what he's talking about.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2008<br>Class Name: WRD306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is Nice, Helpful, and easy.  I took him for Rhetoric and had no interest or knowledge of the subject.  I came away with an A+ and high knowledge of rhetoric. He is great. Quizes are easy, No tests, mid term and Final are a breeze. Highly recommend</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: WRD309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher. He will try to help everyone, but the people who are just trying to skate by he will let them, but it you want to get something out of the class, he will help you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite professors yet. The class was about the public intellectual and he really stimulated interest in the subject. He is an easy grader and one of the nicest professors I have ever had. I went to ever class even though we could miss a few classes. Highly recomend for a focal point class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: ENG290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Abrhams's very nice, helpful if you ask questions.  He's a professor that wants every student in his class to do well.  I got a lot out of this class, more from class presentations then out of the text.  I found the text rather dense at times however, overall the professor is good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2007<br>Class Name: ENG326<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class really asked a lot, but his attitude made it seem like it didn't.  I've never had so much difficult reading- two articles for every class- and our class discussions did nothing to clarify what was going on in the texts.  I think he's a really admirable guy, but it's true that he does play favorites and really isn't clear with assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Abraham teaches rhetorical theory in a seminar format. That means if you don't do the reading, you're not going to get much out of the class. He's a fair and easy grader, and more than accessible. A great option for rhetoric classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice dude, not a teacher. mostly learned from student presentations. seriously a terrible class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: ENG208<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good class at all, and the professor is very unclear, especially about the papers we had to do. Plus, he showed favorites a lot, and it was obvious. Personally, I found this class very similar to rhetoric, so don't take one if you've taken the other. I didn't like him at all, and I never read the book. Waste of money.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont buy the book, its not worth it.  We have quizes every thurs, and he tells you whats gonna be on them.  So that part is easy, and he is sort of a fair grader, but his assinments are confusing sometimes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2006<br>Class Name: ENG306<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The text and his writing is heavy and poor, therefore, it is very hard to understand the points in the text and the questions/assignments he asks/gives the class.  He told us to email the writer of the text if we have questions regarding the reading! wha&#63;! Anyway, There a quiz every thursday, 3 papers, and discussin nboard stuff.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
