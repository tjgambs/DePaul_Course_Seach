Take him if you want a clear and concise professor who knows what he's talking about. One quiz every other week, one homework assignment a week, with opportunities to better your grades on both homeworks and quizzes. Midterm and Final are straightforward.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2015<br>Class Name: 260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I found his lectures to be very clear and straight to the point! His examples during lectures clearly depict what will be on the quizzes and tests.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2015<br>Class Name: 151<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really nice teacher and always willing to help students but I found his teaching style to be confusing. If you need to visually see information broken down then he may not be the best professor for you. Gave one homework a week and a quiz every other week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2015<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy doesn't really know how to teach! Math 260 is nothing hard but it's just that he made it so hard to understand. Cannot warn you enough, just don't take Him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2015<br>Class Name: MATH151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Andy is awesome! I hated calculus before taking his class, absolutely hated it. Andy makes difficult concepts clear, his office hours are worth there weight in gold. Very organized, very knowledgeable, generally great guy over all. Only word of advice is dont buy the text book for 151 because it's $150 and Andy explains things better anyway. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2015<br>Class Name: MAT262263<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Andy rules! He's open to different teaching styles and methods based on student suggestionsadvice. Weekly homework and quizzes are short and to-the-point, rather than long and repetitive. He's very clear and always makes sure that everyone is on the same page before moving on. Very friendly. Highly recommend.</div></div></div></body></html>
