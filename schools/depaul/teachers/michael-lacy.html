The questions on the quizes were a little wordy so needed to read them a couple of times to understand them.  FYI - IN MOST PART THE FINAL HAS THE QUESTION FROM QUIZES, so study them before taking it. A nice guy, and if he sees you trying A is no problem.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok I had him for CMNS and he wasn't bad at all. The whole class consisted of speeches and he's not too hard of grader. But he does take forever to return grades though. I still dont get why but yea, give him a couple weeks or so after ur done. other than that, nice guy, do what he wants you to and you'll get ur A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: CMN203<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While professor Lacy was clearly enthused about intercultural communications, the class was not well formated. It seemed extremely unorganized and the class never knew what was going on. We were clueless on our grades, as it took him a month to grade a single paper. You do well if you are willing to write about what he wants to hear.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
