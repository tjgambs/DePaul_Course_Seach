She is very passionate about her classes and students.  It is very clear that making her students stronger academics and better prepared is one of her top priorities.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nast is extremely interested in helping her students succeed academically, professionally, and personally. She challenges you to think critically and question what you've been programmed to think. She's always willing to make time for students and rewards effort. There are only 2 assignments and the rest is reading and class discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is a misnomer.  It had nothing to with borders or identities, and she as someone else mentioned has an ego problem.  She acts like students' lives revolve around her.  She assigns a work load that is out of line with the rest of the university, and she gives females preferential treatment</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2012<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Heidi is hands down one of the most brilliant professors I've had a DePaul. 204 completely revolutionized the way I view history and helped connect the dots of the interrelatedness of politics, economy, class, and identity. I cannot recommend taking a class with Professor Nast enough. Read, think critically, and engage in class, and you'll have fun</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2012<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't have a great impression of her at first. She seemed quite unorganized and the class begun to bore me, but she really is a great person. So sweet and relatable and helpful. Will go to great lengths to help her students. Still didn't like the class by the end of it, but liked her and will consider taking her again for something else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2011<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nast is one of the most brilliant and  dedicated professors at DePaul. Her class readings are hard, but she wants you to succeed and will go to great lengths to make sure that you understand the material. (As long as you do the work for her class!) This class is demanding, but more than doable with the help of her  insights and course material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a sweetheart!

She's inspiring and always takes time out of her schedule for her students. Extremely knowledgeable about the world we live in and why it is this way. We don't have to research the pet industry anymore, but it makes so much sense in relation to the class that I wish did. Take her! And do the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2010<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Nast is an amazing teacher.  Although her teaching style is a bit different, if you keep your mind open you can learn a lot from her.  She is very caring about her students and is very knowledgeable in her field of study.  She is always willing to help out if you have questions and gives you a lot of guidance, you just have to ask for it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2009<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nast is very intelligent and wonderful. If you pay attention and attend class, everything pulls itself together and makes sense. She isn't trying to EXPLOIT her students by making them do her research dummies. It's just all part of her research, that whatever students' topics might be regarding pets, there's always certain patterns in them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2009<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's wonderful.

Shes a great teacher that really cares about making your brain twitch and work. I LOVE her class. Sure shes a bit scatter brained, but that makes the class interesting. I also do NOT get the ego thing. As long as you open your mouth in class, you'll get on her good side.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2009<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>attending class isn't mandatory, but professor nast will notice if you're gone.. BEWARE. your grade heavily depends on 2 things: the midterm and final paper. for INT'ers required to take 204 or 206, try your hardest to get the other professor, I was unlucky to have her as the only option. the review below mine sums her up nicely.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Heidi's ego seriously impedes the learning process. She humiliates students in front of the class if they say something she doesn't agree with. She forced us to do all of her research for her. We all spent 25+ hours researching her area of study. I felt used, exploited, and I am resentful of the time that this class wasted. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's an intelligent professor but understanding exactly what she expected from students took some time to figure out- be persistent with asking her what you're unsure about. grading scheme was a bit confusing, I was very nervous to get my grade at the end of the quarter</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: INTER206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nast is dedicated to her teaching and her students.

You do learn a lot, she deconstructs your thinking and that can be challenging but it also opens up different perspectives. Its not easy, but if you wanna learn to think outside the box, do it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2008<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She showed up 15 minutes late everyday, hardly prepared for class. This course had no structure whatsoever and we got the syllabus waaay too late. She only read 1/4 of my midterm before giving me a grade.

She is condescending, judgmental, and just plain crazy. I could not stand listening to her for 90 minutes.

She helps students transfer their feelings and realizations into words of meaning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2004<br>Class Name: INT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>why are we paying you to teach if you refuse to do it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2004<br>Class Name: INT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2004<br>Class Name: INT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very challenging professor, the workload is heavy, but if you're interested in the topic, it's worth it at the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2004<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2004<br>Class Name: HON204<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Blames &quot;whitie&quot; for everything wrong with America and she's caucasian!
