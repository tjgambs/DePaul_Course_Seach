For the various assignments and papers we were given, there were very few guidelines and criteria. There is no indication of how your grade was determined. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable and excited about the material. Yes, there is a TON of memorizing, but if you make flashcards and actually do the work you will be fine. I didn't read the text book, I just studied of the studyguide and I did fine. Take the papers seriously, but she is a very fair grader! Great class, awesome teacher, moderate amount of work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2013<br>Class Name: HAA281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's extremely annoying. The class isn't the most difficult, but if you're taking it to fulfill an Arts & Literature requirement, there are definitely better options.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is super knowledgable in the topic. She is very hard grader, but if you pay attention in class and read, the class should be very enlightining. She might forget that most students are busniess students and takes the class a little too serious. I really enjoyed her teaching this topic and  the class overall.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2013<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was such an informed source and was so passionate on the topic! I had her for HON 110 Frank Lloyd Wright Discovery and it's amazing how much she knows about all his works. She's very personable and if you at least TRY she'll love you. Very enjoyable class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: HAA281<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class is REALLY HARD. She's a sweet lady but she's kind of intimidating. Make sure you actually do the readings because they'll come back to bite you on the exams if you don't. Exams are really difficult in general too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2013<br>Class Name: HAA391<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am in love with her. She is my favourite Art History professor and I hope to have her again soon. Her Museum Studies class was fascinating and exciting. The class was small and she was pretty laid back. She is so incredibly knowledgable and very personable. If you have an opportunity to take a class with her, do it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2013<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cheryl is awesome! She knows her stuff that's for sure. I agree that her class and her grading system is a bit difficult, but as for her exams, they are pretty straight forward. A lot of memorization and understanding concepts. If you're afraid of those things, you really shouldn't be taking Art History classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2013<br>Class Name: HAA281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cheryl is one of the best professors I have ever had in my college career. Her class can be difficult at times but not unbearable but she is so passionate about architecture and she knows her stuff. Her passion will make you strive for excellence in her class. I  never look at Chicago architecture the same now.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: HAA281<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2012<br>Class Name: HAA281<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exams are way too difficult.

Her Frank Lloyd Wright class was extremely enjoyable. Her tests are very straightforward, and if you pay attention in class and study your notes, you will have no problem. In addition, she is EXTREMELY knowledgable in her field and encourages everyone to succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago and loved her. Listen in class, go over your notes before tests and you will be fine. She answers questions clearly and explains things in depth. It's a lot of work but just requires time and isn't too tough. I would definitely recommend her and would take a class with her again. Plus she is very nice!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had her for Discover Chicago: Frank Lloyd Wright and I have to admit that she's a very pleasant lady and straightforward teacher.  She gets to the point in everything. The work load is pretty heavy, but I definitely enjoyed her class and her VERY ORGANIZED lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: LSP411<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely love Professor Bachand!

This was the hardest class I have ever taken at DePaul with the hardest professor. Midterm and exams have study guides with over 80 pieces of art to memorize when only about 10 are on there. Its rediculous and so hard to pass.Terrible teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2011<br>Class Name: HAA281<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a really good teacher. Class was mandatory. PPT heavy. Read the books or you will get it in the butt for the midterm and final. If you read you'll do well. Great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: HAA281<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not blow off art req. A lot of reading, and ton of memorization. About 56 slides for midterm same for final to memorize. Tests are harder then past art history classes i'v had. She is nice lady although and very passionate about the subject. 25% midterm,30% final,30% long paper, 15% attend. cant miss more then 2 classes or you lose 10% of grade!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take notes and you'll be fine.
