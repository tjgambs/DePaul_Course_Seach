Stay away from her if you can. She made the midterm so hard that everyone failed it and for the huge 100-hour project she assigned, she was never clear about what she expected from us. The sole positive quality is that she's lively and her lectures are interesting. But she cannot properly run a class to save her life.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: ISM210<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I have ever had.  Completely useless class.  She is one of those teachers that think her class is the most important ever.  thinks people should spent 80-100 hours on just the project for a 4 credit hour class.  I had absolutely nothing graded until after the drop date or I would've dropped it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: ISM210<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She took forever to respond to emails, and she hardly covered test questions in her presentations or lectures.

You can tell she lives her field of work. She makes funny comments here and there. :-)</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
