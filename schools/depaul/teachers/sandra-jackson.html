She was an English professor, so she's a tough grader, but the papers and assignments were all pretty short and straight forward. Also, there is a group project. I really loved this class! Discussions were interesting and really made me think.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2014<br>Class Name: WGS336<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Jackson was not helpful nor clear. I took Woman and Film and I can't tell you one thing I learned. All we did was watch movies, discuss them (in which she didn't say anything), and write papers. I know this sounds okay, but she was a horrible grader. She would give feedback that made no sense and was illegible. I would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2010<br>Class Name: WGS212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Jackson is just amazing! This class made me grow as a person.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: WMS212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love Dr. Jackson and this class. Sometimes students in the class say ridiculous anti-feminist statements but Dr. Jackson keeps her cool. (I wish she would call them out). Interesting readings and assignments. I suggest this professor and this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: WMS212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a really good professor. There were three big papers in the class and mini writing assignments along the way. You have to read all the text because the discussion is classed based. it's a really interesting class and I would recommed prof Jackson to anyone. She's a really really understanding lady and I think her requirements are fair.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2008<br>Class Name: WMS212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Jackson is a cool lady. She's very intelligent and personable during class discussions.  She doesn't make the class about her but rather about your thoughts and your ideas on the readings. You must read the readings, although there are alot of articles and anthogolies to read. She grades papers tough because she was 1st an english teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2007<br>Class Name: WMS212<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>READINGS REQUIRED ARE INTERESTING BUT HER GRADING FOR PAPERS, WHICH INCLUDED ABOUT 3 PAPERS (3-4 PAGES), WAS TOUGH AND IT IS REALLY HARD TO GET A'S ON PAPERS</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: WMS219<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jackson is intimidating at first but by the end of the quarter I liked her. You do a lot of reading and writing. She was an English major or something like that and she will tear your papers apart, but you will learn to write better. She is strict on attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: WMS203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very interesting teacher. Class was basically just an open discussion, and the reading's really intersting. She's really helpful with work. I got a C on my first one and she made me meet with her so i could do better. This calss was actually fun at times.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: GROWINGUPFEM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I heard that the class has changed, but when I had it, it was a giant therapy session. Her grading was biased towards her favorites and how much personal info you divulged.  Worst college experience ever.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2005<br>Class Name: WMS334<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The hardest grader I have had at DePaul.  Good teacher, but the grading was a suprise.  The class was pertty interesting, and I did alright, but if you pride yourself on your writing abilities, this class will prove different.  The class was probably worth taking, even with the &quot;b,&quot; just be prepared.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: WMS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really a wonderful woman.

If you disagree with her she makes you look like an idiot and looks to give bad grades.  Watch out.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2004<br>Class Name: WMS212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Jackson is a really good teacher.
