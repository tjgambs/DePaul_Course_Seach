Although her class is not hard, she is all across the board and can't understand students simple questions. I would not take a class with her ever again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Carla is amazing. Her lectures are fun and I truly enjoyed going to her class. She gives you everything you need to know for her tests and quizzes. Don't buy the book, her powerpoint slides have everything. There were 6 small projects, 2 quizzes, a midterm & final. You do have to put in the effort to get an A but she makes it really easy. TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Print class notes and attend and you'll be fine. No reading from the book, she makes it as simple as she can by using powerpoint. She genuinely likes teaching and her students at DePaul; highly recommend taking her for Management Information Systems</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2014<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>The tests are very easy. Just review the slides before the exam and you should end up with a good grade.   Her projects can be tough because when she explains how to do them she goes very quickly and it's easy to get lost. However, if you go to your office hours she'll show you the ropes again.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First off, don't buy the book for this class because you will never use it. This was a very easy class where the Professor did everything she could to ensure your success in the class. She has a big personality as well so classes will catch your interest and make you laugh. I would recommend to a friend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2013<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Completely weird professor.  She will not comprehend the simplest questions you ask her, which results in the question being repeated so many times!  Full of herself, cocky, do yourself a favor and avoid her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2012<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pointless to be in class, everything is on  PowerPoint slides. If you got a good memorization; congrats you'll get an A. If you don't, better read every slide few times because everything on the slides is on the quizzes and exams. Overall, easy class but requires good memorization. Too many questions on the midterm. Teacher is very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2012<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was easy, McKenzie was easy too. The class was boring though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2012<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor. Very funny, knows her material. Enjoys teaching. Do not buy a book because her powerpoints is all she wants you to know. Study exactly from powerpoints and you will get an A. For projects, make sure you don't miss any little detail she asks for.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tells you exactly what you need to do for quizzes, exams, projects...practically gives you the answers beforehand. Only thing, she talks extremely loud so class is a bit rough to sit through.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lousy Professor, favors woman and she reads this. Maybe now she'll know we all hated her. Avoid her if you want to actually learn.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE MIS WITH HERE! She is extremely nice and helpful. She wants everyone to get an A and does everything she can to make it as easy as possible. She gives you the exact test questions and people really complain!&#63; She tries to make not so interesting topics seem enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class itself is easy but she is a horrible teacher. She talks about all the experience she has had in the MIS industry but for some reason I don't see it. We would ask the simplest questions and she couldn't comprehend the question itself. She should not be teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2009<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably one of the worst professors at DePaul, claims she has so much experience in the industry but it never showed. A complete airhead.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Carla is a GREAT professor! She definitely makes the make the class interesting; even if you are NOT interested.  She knows her stuff!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2007<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Carla's class is interesting, even when I didn't want to come to class . . . I still enjoyed it.  I often tell her that I hadn't had a professor like her. She makes the class appealing even if the subject matter is tough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2007<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow. They WORST professor at depaul BY FAR. How DePaul let this woman have a job is beyond me...do yourself a favor and stay away from this ...thing (she looks more like a man if u ask me)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Carla is an alright teacher. She teaches straight from powerpoint, which contains the same material as the book. Study the powerpoints and notes and the tests/quizzes will be easy. If she knows you name by the end of the quarter, you will get the participation points. (get on her good side) Overall, this was an ok class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2007<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is boring, but she is trying to make it interesting, she explains everything very clear, and it is easy to get an A in her class if you do all the work.  She tells you everything that will appear on the quiz or final - if you study everything she says it will be an easy class for you</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class and Carla is a good instructor.  She makes the class easy enough for those who aren't in the IT field.  If you don't pass her class or able to do the work, you're doing something wrong.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class projects are fun and you learn a lot.  I passed the IT section of the CIA exam because of her class.  She knows her stuff and she uses her real-life examples to help you appreciate what the book is saying.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really tough and unclear. He quiz was made in a way that didn't help the student at all! She is so unclear that she tends to confuse herself even though she does know the material. Wouldn't recomend her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible, horrible teacher! The material shouldn't be that hard, but her teaching style isn't clear and she's unfair which makes the class SUCK! Don't take her unless you have to and DON'T buy the book!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class should not be difficult but some how this **** managed to make tuff.  Do yourself a favor and get a different teacher cause she sucks big time baby!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not one of DePaul's finest. She knows the subject matter but that is basically the extent of it. Sometimes she seems to be on the borderline between ditsy and slow. Also her course is a lot of memorization some of which seems to just be to fill up some space and nothing more. I wouldn't recommend her class unless it was a last resort.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2005<br>Class Name: MIS<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst teacher ever taken at DePaul.

All you do is memorize pointless terms and you never really learn anything usefull... but she is easy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst teacher I have had at DePaul.  Very condescending and moody.  Subject matter is pointless and she requires you to strictly memorize.  Group projects are an inconvenience and are pointless.  Take her if you like being treated like a first grader and like to think like your in first grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2005<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: MIS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SOooooooo EASY, You don't even have to come to class as long as you print all the slides she puts on blackboard.DON'T bother buying the book,she summarizes everything on her slides.TESTS ARE SOOOO EASY,2 projects EASY & NO CHALLANGE.

She realizes that you have to balance multiple classes, study, work AND she still makes the lecture interesting.  She is the best instructor I have ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2005<br>Class Name: ACC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Waste of time and energy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2005<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a knowledgeable teacher. I found her to be fairly difficult. You have to read the book and come to class. The exams are also pretty difficult. I ended up with around a B- or so. You have to pay attention if you want a good grade. She is ok overall</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2004<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy Easy Easy...Carla's very nice and doesn't expect too much at all.  2 Projects that are not much work, easy midterm, and mindless final...Plus, she cancels a lot of classes for you to work on your group projects.  Take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2004<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of a waste of time class. Powerpoint lectures are a bore. Carla's really sweet and makes for a delightful/entertaining class period-unfortunately, the subject material is lame. Easy A.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
