Felt like NFP portion was rushed but also wasn't as interested in this portion so my attention was less than FS portion.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2013<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Vadbunker was always very helpful if you need extra help on certain topics. The second half of the class was significantly more difficult, but I will say that he never tries to trick you on the tests. Just practice all the quizzes and homework problems. Know everything about bond problems.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2012<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is great! It was tough to get through consolidations but overall just study the quizzes, homework and powerpoint slides and you'll do well. It's a 3 hour class but the professor makes it go by fairly quickly. Exams are straightforward. Take Vadbunker!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2012<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>FYI folks. This professor is hard! But I did take away more from this class than any other in the program because you have to learn to survive his 3 hour exams. Research paper due and weekly quizzes. If you work full time, take this class solo. Professor is as great guy but strict! All in all the class is great. You will learn.Good luck!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor just gets boring really boring sometimes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2011<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best accounting teachers that I have taken.  As long as you go to class and read what he says to read, do the homework, and the quizes you will do good.  His tests are straight forward.  I usually get really nervous and freak out when I see accounting tests, but his were not like that. No tricks!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2011<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He likes to read off his PowerPoint slides for the majority of class. You'll learn plenty of CPA material, but by the 3rd hour, you'll be desperate to leave.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You won't have any trouble with the core concepts. His tests, however, are a complete maze that require you to know EVERYTHING from the book, down to the last detail. Far too difficult, this isn't the CPA, Bill. No curve either, even when the test average is 60-70%.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE...HORRIBLE PROFESSOR. he just reads off the slides. Does not explain much and is short tempered. was NOT able to answer students' queries many times. Midterm and finals are impossible. you don't even know if hes gonna curve or not. It depends upon his mood, i guess. NOT RECOMMENDED at all. SYS (Save Your Souls) by keeping away from this gu</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a joke. All he did was read off the slides. Come on, I don't pay 2 grand for a class that I can teach myself at home. Don't even go to class it's useless and its not like he helps. Take a different teacher so you can actually understand the material and LEARN it, not just have it read to you!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He should not be teaching.Has no passion for students,teaching and being in an university setting.Very hard,no guidance,his policy is to be mean and nasty to students.Do not talk to him in private,you will cry for days after that. If you get over a D,you are lucky.DePaul should not hire teachers like him, and listen to its students a bit more.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: ACT305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>his online quizzes were helpful. 13 kids got an A on the midterm. And he got a bad rating bc most students are complainers. PS i'm not the teacher; i am an actual student.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2010<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>poor guy. If I didn't have to take this course at the time, I wouldn't take his.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The teacher is very mean to students. And once I asked him about a question that he didn't know much, he didn't even try to say something about it. Moreover, the exams are way to hard for students!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2009<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bill Vadbunker was a good, methodical teacher. There is not much a teacher can do to make Intermediate Accounting exciting, so you cannot blame him if you find the material boring. Read the chapters before class, do the HW, study and you can get an A.  He will tell you what the exam will cover, and it is up to you how much you prepare.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: ACCT541<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>25% students fail his mid-term exam.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2009<br>Class Name: ACCT541<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors! Very fair and strict-helps you really learning sth. I registered for his ACC 543, cann't believe they are cancelling his section!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2009<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is nice. However, the Mid-term and Final exams are too difficult.

Stern and fair! Class is not that hard as long as you catch up. I don't think previous comments are fair for him. Great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2009<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, great accountant with good credentials but not a very effective teacher. Goes through EVERY powerpoint slide which makes the class boring. He cares and is helpful to an extent but class is extremely difficult. He is not a full-time professor at the university and is evident in his method. Only teacher i had at Depaul I didn't care for.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2009<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, tries to make it interesting, but rather dull and monotonous.  Sometimes difficult to hear in the back of the room.  Final exam was very difficult even after preparing with the practice quizzes.  Some material on both the midterm and final, which was a bit much since there is so much material to cover in the course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2008<br>Class Name: ACCT541<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. was a nice guy, but was not very clear with his explanations.  You can tell that he's really interested in accounting, but has difficulty communicating subject.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
