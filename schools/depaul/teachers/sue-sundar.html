Her lectures are long and it is very hard to pay attention. She is a very smart person but her class isn't a welcoming class.   You have to read the book and you need to put a lot of work outside of class. I would consider the class a regurgitation class, you cram for the test and forget it all afterward.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2015<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof. Midterm, Final, and an easy paper at the end. Just go over the slides in D2L and practice the problems she has in the slides and you'll be fine. Lectures are a bit boring but she does relate a lot of the material to the real world. A lot of group discussion too. I would take her again. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2015<br>Class Name: 301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simply put, a good teacher. Class consists of powerpoint slides, a midterm, final and a paper. Sounds like alot, but it's not. I actually feel like I learned something. She's really nice and very helpful. If I took the time to write this I obviously loved or hated the class. She made it worth it.</div></div></div></body></html>
