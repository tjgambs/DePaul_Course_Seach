He is so passionate about Philosophy and makes the classes so interesting. So much reading though and at times confusing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: PHL296<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this professor he is so nice and helpful. There is alot of reading, as expected and a weekly discussion paper but as long as you do the readings you will be fine. The class is very engaging but he will not pick on you, so it is okay to hide in the back :^)  Totally fascinating class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2011<br>Class Name: PHL387<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so freakin cute, and is definitely passionate about the subject. I actaly loved going to class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2010<br>Class Name: PHIL295<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Philosophy is extremely dense...but he does a good job at explaining it and keeping focus. VERY HELPFUL. There is a lot of reading in the course that you need to take your time with and you need to work hard on your papers...but if you are willing to work hard and try to understand the philosophy, perkins is more than willing to assist.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2010<br>Class Name: PHL295<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perkins is a tough grader who taught dense material  but did the best to make it interesting. He does care about attendance so come to class and do all the papers he assigns. With all the response papers, that became annoying but other than that I recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: ASIANPHIL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely not the worst ever. Interesting if you pay attention. Fair grader, definitely willing to help as long as you're respectful. Allowed two absences. Final was an easy paper. I'd recommend him, just not for a morning class...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: PHL295<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher, great guy, plenty of office hours and is willing to help. Would not suggest this course for a science major due to the course content, but this teacher is amazing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: ASIANPHL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hard grader. don't take the class if your not a phl major. nothing but him talking in class that makes you go to sleep.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/24/2005<br>Class Name: PHL287<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class but I didnt like my grades.He doesnt give great feedback on how to improve.He says it,but its not really clear.I got a B for challenging myself and doing ALL the work. He's very intelligent and knows his stuff.Friendly and always willing to talk to students if needed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2005<br>Class Name: PHL295<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart and focused prof.

The next paper I wrote in forty-five minutes and got the same grade.  I do not understand this man.  You do the math.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: PHL295<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NOT a Phil major and took a challenging class. Despite this it was not hell. Prof is very nice and not intimidating. He lectures well. Normal amount of reading. He grades fairly. Helpful in one on one meetings. An interesting class, worth the time, whether a major or not. Prof Perkins should be sought out if taking Phil classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this man.

Does tend to ramble in a monotone and sometimes appears to be talking to himself rather than the class. However he takes in all opinions and rewards effort almost as much as smarts.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2004<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perkins is a cool dude! Very mellow, but very smart. He talks in a monotone that you have to get used to. I like how he encourages ALL opinions and theories, and he doesn't cop out with easy answers. He makes you THINK.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2004<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He made philosophy very accessible, and got me interested enough in the subject to want to take another class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2004<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is f-ing hot.

Laid back and mellow. Knows his stuff and tries to make you understand ancient phil. by incorporating it into his and your life experiences.

His class was hard at first but once you get that hang of Philosophy, I think he would be the best teacher to have.
