Her attitude in people's writings is fully supportive and she is extremely lenient on topics that you write your essays about. That being said be prepared to write 3-4 page papers about every other week, but that isn't so bad for most.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice lady but pretty boring professor. I took her in the late afternoon and it was hard to keep a lot of the students interested. If you do the homework, pay attention, and go to class, you'll do well. She even let us out early half of the time. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Martin is the sweetest! She really cares about your work and takes time to give everyone feedback. She even meets with everyone at some point in the term to learn more about you one on one. The course load isn't too heavy and she has us do some interesting assignments like "taboo" writing. Definitely recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Martin is the sweetest lady. Her WRD103 class was wonderful, but she can sometimes be unclear. She talks very slowly and thinks aloud. Overall a very easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good professor. is a little un clear. Makes papers very intersting. takes every assignment seriously. Does too many peer edits.!! like all class i think it is a lil boring!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2007<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very nice lady and a good teacher. She grades the papers pretty easy though, i must say. The quizzes are a bit annoying and somewhat difficult to get A's on, but if you read the stuff and get atleast B's on the quizzes you should be good for an A. she's a liltte boring at times but still pretty cool when it comes to grading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice person and a teacher who really helps her students.

ENG 104 especially: all the class was was a couple quizzes (drops the lowest grade/i never read!) and the research paper stuff... which she probably didn't even actually read.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really really slow...takes long pauses in the middle of sentences and that can get very tiring. She often seems like she doesnt prepare at all for class; sometimes i felt like i had a better grasp on the readings than she did. Easy class, but I didnt gain anything new from the course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the easiest classes ive taken. she is helpful  and gives you basic assignments. its kinda like learning hs freshmen english</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes a very nice teacher.
