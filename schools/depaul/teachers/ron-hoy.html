It's actually &quot;Hoye&quot;.  He's a good teacher who seems approachable to his students and is engaging in conversation.  His assignments and work load are very reasonable and he does a well making religion interesting.  Attendance is a big component of the grade here, so be sure to go.  I recommend this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2008<br>Class Name: RELIG228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is Really good teacher: smart, helpful, open-minded, and really, really funny in kind of intelligent way.
