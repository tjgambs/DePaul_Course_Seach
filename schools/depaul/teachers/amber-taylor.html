She is overly enthusiastic about her class and the material. It's just writing.. I can't say I learned much or enjoyed it but with not much effort got a B so it's not a hard pick. A lot of in class work in terms of reflections on the reading assignments so you need to be prepared in that respect.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I personally did not connect with her teaching style and I felt that many of the readings were pointless. The research paper is a pain, but the worst part is the unnecessary assignments that are assigned prior to turning in the completed research paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of the things she had to say seemed pointless. It seemed like she tried to make herself seem really smart. She had an attitude. If she didn't like you she would treat you different and grade different</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's convinced that she's the smartest woman in the world. Every in-class assignment is useless, and she never handed them back or told us the grade we received on them. Our grades just magically appeared on CampusConnect at the end of the quarter. She's unclear, rude, and unhelpful. However, that said, the final papers are a joke...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I kind had an up and down experience with her. She thinks she's really smart which she may be, but comes off arrogant sometimes. She's not very good about grading assignments. I don't think she read my final paper. You can definitely get a good grade though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes extremely friendly and helpful, and a solid prof. Can be a little disorganized and ditsy, but she makes up for it. Not to harsh of grader and gives a manageable amount of work. If you show up to class, do what she asks and listen to her suggestions, you'll walk away with a good grade. Overall a good Prof. who I would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes very nice and helpful. A little disorganized, but makes up for it. Not to hard or demanding, and if you do what she asks and listen to her comments you'll get a good grade. Overall, shes a quality professor who I would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Personally, I found this class pointless. I hated the hate that she is so picky about everyone's writing. She is a nice lady who wants you to do well but the class is somewhat pointless.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This wasn't an INCREDIBLE class nor was it HORRIBLE. She is teaching best when she is having fun and lets herself go a bit. She has a good sense of humor but it seems like her fear of being underestimated because of her youth is holding her back. She tries too hard but if you take her suggestions into consideration for your papers you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best! I loved her class because she tells you EXACTLY what she wants. If you listen in class and take her advice in writing your papers you'll get an a. You don't really have to do the readings but it's helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good lecturer.  I think perhaps some of the trial and error of her stricter self caused some f the earliest comments. She is very helpful in structure, and does a good job of letting you know exactly what she wants. Her only down side is that her assignments are a little to large for the time frames alloted. I would recommend her  to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her! She's very intelligent and I like her lectures. I recommend her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was an alright teacher. Worked around my athletic schedule. You can miss a few classes and not get docked, just do the work, do the numerous reviews of your papers and you'l get a nice grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2006<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>sort bad, yet easy. I got a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A young but boring teacher with a poker face. Does not conversate with her students aside from lectures and is very strict about attendence. Students are locked outside if they are seconds late for a presentation. Class is tolerable but she always goes straight to business.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>as previously stated she is not understanding at all, expects her students to understand her vague directions and when or if you ask her for help, it is horrible help. shes is a horrible teacher that should resort to working in a quiet cubicle alone somewhere and leave teaching to people who actually enjoy doing it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid this teacher at all cost.  She is a hardass who just came out of graduate school and is very demanding and stuck up.  She is not clear with her directins and expects you to write the perfect paper!  The material is dry and she is not making it any better.  Attendance taking daily, surprise quizzes, lots of reading, many papers...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not helpful with her students at all. She attempts to teach good material but i don't think she is quite qualified yet.</div></div></div></body></html>
