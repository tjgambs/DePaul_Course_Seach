She didn't treat us like students or future teachers, more like kids who didn't know what they were doing.  She assigns way to much work and should be more compassionate with her students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2004<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone who did bad in her class...that is their own fault. This is a college course and by now you should not be spoon fed directions. If you pay attention and keep up with the work, you will do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2004<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good prof. about 9 weeks of busy work, final project is super easy. homework is optional most of the time. no tests. assigns reading but you don't have to do it (its common sense for any teacher). class only meets 1x a week bc of clinical experience</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2004<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a very nice and patient professor.  She will do anything she can to help a student and is really experienced and knowledgable of her field.  you will do fine in her class the readings are not important and she is an easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2004<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall great teacher.

The majority of the quarter is busy work leading up to the final project. She grades pretty easily and is nice. Some of her directions are unclear and there is a lot of work overall.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2004<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher!

She cares about the future of education. She is however unclear about what she's looking for when it comes to projects and assumes that the class has time to do the outrageous amount of reading she assigns.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2003<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's easy if you want to do the research on your own. She is helpful sometimes but she throws you into projects right away with out explaining them effectively and isn't always specific with feedback.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2003<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down, one of the best teachers I've had.
