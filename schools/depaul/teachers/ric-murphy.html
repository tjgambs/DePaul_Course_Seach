He taught us, but he also continued to reform his lessons and ask us to think with him along the way.  He asked questions that we couldn't answer, then left us to decide if we wanted to know the answers.  Some did, others not.  But he gave us the freedom to learn from him all that we wanted to, and that, I believe, is great teaching.  I will probably continue to piece together what I've learned from him over the course of a lifetime.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: ACTING101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are in his class it is safe to assume that you have some talent. Ric likes to laugh so make your scenes funny. But he's big into the second city /improv style. If you are naturally funny, then he will like you. &quot;just play the goddamn game&quot; - one of his quotes. Ric is the best, be yourself, and don't get cut like i did :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2005<br>Class Name: ACT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2005<br>Class Name: 1STYEARACTING<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ric Murphy is one of the most important, creative, authentic and inspiring teachers of acting at any university.  His class changed my life, and pointed me into a new direction in the theatre.  In my life he has moved from professor to mentor to friend with ease and purpose.  Ric is one of the last true instructors of acting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2005<br>Class Name: ACTING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
