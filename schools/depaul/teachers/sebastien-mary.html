He expects you to know things that a normal student wouldn't know. He has random outbursts of putting people on the spot that comes off rude. Honestly the only thing that made this class tolerable was the SI leaders sessions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2015<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I attended every class, took notes and did the readings/ homework.  I even sat in the 2nd row because he constantly said those in the back will fail. Still despite my effort to show my discomfort with talking on subjects I am still learning about he would call me out. He said I'd learn better since I had to speak in front of the class. He was wrong</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2015<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>Gets annoyed when students ask for help. Does not give any partial credit on exam. Very condescending and a generally mean person. Avoid him. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2015<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for Spring quarter 2015, not because he had raving reviews but because he fit with my schedule. He's a tough grader, if you're not an econ major, I would avoid taking him. I struggle with this subject and he goes through the material rather quickly. Has an accent. Hot. But being hot doesn't make up for the difficult class. Soyonara pal!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2015<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is BRILLIANT. It is an extremely tough subject, but he makes it interesting by providing current examples, and he's such a dork! It's a really rough class, yes, but if you read and look online for other people's notes and videos it helps a ton! We're in college, paying A TON of money, might as well dig deep and get some good stuff </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2015<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He'd be one of the best teachers if he actually acted like he cared when helping students. He expects you to ONLY practice on your own with equations and etc. When someone asks him to do a practice problem, he gets annoyed and says that it's "something we should be doing outside of class" instead of asking him...  He's hot, I'll give him that. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2015<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>my god is he fiiiiiiiine. i previously failed eco 106 and passed his. his exams are very practical, and he gives you clues about what will be tested. he wants you to learn so you need to be able to implement economics to real world issues, which he helps you do throughout the quarter. he's laid back and funny. no surprises. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's hot but a hard teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: 361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>His style is very European but he's easy to understand and GIVES you your notes. Most Econ majors pass this class but it's good for all majors because it discusses real world scenarios and gives you a grasp on what's happening internationally. No study guide but if there was it would just compromise of the powerpoints so there's no need for one. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2014<br>Class Name: ECONOMICS361<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: WD</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, really knows and loves the subject but terrible class if you're not an economics major. Midterm was rough, doesn't believe in study guides or cheat sheets and expects you to know all of the material from his 40+ eight powerpoints (just the midterm). And the final is cumulative. In my class of 30 kids only 12 were left by the end. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2014<br>Class Name: ECONOMICS361<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>I took international trade with him for the global business perspective elective. Lectures were ineffective, and tests were tough. Thoroughly read the book if you want to do well. It is very long and boring unless you really enjoy economics. An overall annoying course to take, it being an elective unrelated to my major. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2014<br>Class Name: ECO361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One and a half hours of bad lectures and hair combing. His lectures are ineffective, so if you want to do well read the chapters (longgg). The concepts aren't hard to grasp if you, again, read the chapters; just don't rely on his lectures to get you through his very thorough tests. </div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
