This is by far one of my favorite classes so far at DePaul. The class discussions can get heated, which I loved. The readings are basically mandatory for your participation but easy. Really enjoyed having her as a professor - NO TESTS!! Final was a group presentation. Take her. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2015<br>Class Name: 103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Totally hot, first of all. Second of all, super nice, clear, and helpful. Not easy A but not hard A, you just at least skim the readings and attend class and you'll do well. She really listens to her student's opinions and cares about them doing well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2015<br>Class Name: 103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Totally hot, first of all.

The classwork isn't hard at all so long as you pay attention, and she's a very easy grader. Would take again. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: 103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SO sweet and a great instructor. A lot of readings and discussion based but no test or quizzes. She's super clear about instruction and will meet with you if you need the extra help. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2015<br>Class Name: 103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolute smoke show first of all. On top of that, she's extremely intelligent. Very knowledgeable in her field of study. No tests. No quizzes. Pure discussion. You don't like coming to class? Not the class for you. You don't like tests? This is the class for you. I wouldn't say easy A, but its definitely easy to obtain an A if you put in work. </div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
