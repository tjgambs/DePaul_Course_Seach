The class was only an hour and a half but she was so mean to anyone who would answer questions that it would be dead silent for the whole period and it would feel like forever. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF. Had her for Soc of ROCK MUSIC, should be fun right? Wrong. Avoid at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2015<br>Class Name: 280<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just avoid this class at all costs. I don't ever understand a word she's saying and she makes you feel bad if you don't agree with her. I don't know how people have even passed this class in the past... just wish I had known to avoid before signing up. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2015<br>Class Name: SOC281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rude, disrespectful and condescending to students, loves embarrassing anyone who is late, yawns or doesn't agree with what she has to say.  Will also deduct points for those reasons as well. Constantly patting herself on the back for writing the textbook used in class, which she expects you to know from front to back. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2015<br>Class Name: SOC281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>If you like being awash in a bizarre world of craziness and fury, take this class. It doesn't follow linear time or common sense. She often backtracks or goes on weird spiels and will not hesitate to immediately invalidate anything you say. One email is 10% of your grade. It's almost masochistically hilarious, so I would go for that. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2015<br>Class Name: 280<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay, so I've taken two courses with Deena. I wish someone told me these things before I signed up: 1. GET ON HER GOOD SIDE. If she likes you, you get an A. 2. FOLLOW HER FORMATS. She has weird rules. Follow them anyway. 3. AGREE WITH HER. She knows what she wants to hear, say it. That's how you pass. 4. GO TO EVERY CLASS. You get extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2015<br>Class Name: SOC280<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a tough teacher, but in the end, I learned a lot. Was never happy to go to her class but I did do well on the final. You have to read A TON and the outlines get tedious. Make sure you do all the assignments and show up to every class (she counts against your grade if you don't show). Get on her good side and you'll probably be ok. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: SOC280<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously, do not take this class. I'm just tacking on the nail here, but one of the most stubborn professors at DePaul. Does not make any of her assignments clear. Attempts to make assigned readings relevant to the digital era but embarrassingly fails at it. If you want an A in the course, just kiss her ass and tell her she's interesting. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: SOC387<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Weinstein is one of the most interesting people I have ever met. She is absolutely brilliant, but extremely intimidating. She grew on me through out the quarter as I got to know her and her teaching style. Her class is a challenge, but I learned a lot and it got me to think critically. Don't rule her out. I will remember this class forever.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: SOC280<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the worst teacher I have ever had at Depaul.  She never clarifies anything and never answers your question clearly; and if you do have a question she mocks, insults, and questions your reading ability.  She is way to focused on the structure of you completed assignment and seems like she can care less about the content. also very arrogant.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: SOC280<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very smart, has a lot of substance, but very proud and antagonistic.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone who says they do not like Dr. Weinstein clearly does not a challenge. Although she is strict on certain things, she honestly knows so much about what she is talking about and is so passionate. She is very intellectual and I have learned so much from her class. If you actually want to learn take her class! The homework load is not that bad.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2013<br>Class Name: SOC330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dr. weinstein is the best prof that i have ever had in my life....yes she is strict but so is the real world....she cares and her intelligence is deep and profound....yet she a very big heart....i have seen gone to other school for a masters....and i can still say without a doubt she is the best teacher i have ever had in my university career..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: SOC280<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The readings are interesting, but if you're someone who benefits from class discussion then this is not the class for you. She makes frequently reductive comments and does not facilitate a welcoming environment. She frequently informs students that they're "wrong" with no further explanation, and she deducts points for yawning.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2013<br>Class Name: ROCK101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expectation are clear from the first day.

She's quirky, but one of the best Professors I've had at DePaul. Don't listen to the other reviews, she is awesome as long as you're not an easily offended ass. Take her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2012<br>Class Name: SOC201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof was very clear about her expectations.

She does have a really bad attitude when things dont go her way. GO TO CLASS AND DONT YAWN!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2012<br>Class Name: SOC281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If DePaul asked their professors to uphold the same standards they ask of their students Weinstein would be long gone. Her classroom etiquette is deplorable; she is condescending, rude to students, and not being able to yawn or use the restroom while she lectures is sadistic. Shame on her and shame on DePaul for employing her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2012<br>Class Name: ROCK101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You crybabies that complain about a professor demanding that you act like adults, show up on time, and do the work need to grow up.  She's demanding, but her classes are as interesting as the students who participate make them, so take a look in the mirror if you didn't think you learned anything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2011<br>Class Name: SOC281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Even though I got an A and she liked me, I absolutely despised this class. There are too many negative aspects to discuss. Do not take a class with this woman. I will never forget the day I walked in literally 1 minute late and was publicly humiliated.

I took her class while working on my teaching certification. She was rude, had unreasonable demands, was demeaning to students and played favorites. Professor Weinstein's class stands out in my mind as the worst class that I have taken in my educational career. She showed zero respect for the students.

Anything said in a paper or in class needs to be exactly what you mean, as it seems she lacks the ability to infer any opinion that is not hers. Class discussions and tests are obnoxious when your notes from readings MUST be in your own words and are graded with very specific criteria, however tests ask for specific terms.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2011<br>Class Name: SOC280<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows what she is teaching about, but she isn't open to being wrong or ur opinion-she shoots u down & moves on to the next person mid-sentence. She is extremely strict where if u r late, you sit in the back/don't talk and u are counted as absent and if u yawn w/o covering ur mouth u are deducted points.

She will pick favorites and least favorites in the class, and no matter how well you do on tests or papers, she will grade you based on whether she likes you or not.
