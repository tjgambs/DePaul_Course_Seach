I looked forward to going to class and listening to him speak. He is a nonjudgemental, open-minded, caring, and encouraging individual. You can tell he really enjoys teaching.

Great class.                                a.t</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2010<br>Class Name: SPEEC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have struggled with communication my whole life.

I am now more aware of my strengths and weaknesses and look forward to developing better relationships. I also, found self-confidence. Thank you!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2009<br>Class Name: HC336<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chaplain Jay shares his personaility, sense of caring and expertise.  I went into this course not knowing what to expect and left with more than I could have asked for.  Thanks Chaplain Jay.  Hope to see you around campus!(:</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2009<br>Class Name: HC336<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was very insightful and I found the material very useful.  Jay's lessons in ambiguity were a bit challenging at first but prooved to be very insightful.  His approach to teaching helps students to learn on their own rather than being handed the lesson.  Great Class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2008<br>Class Name: HC903<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chaplain Jay is such a great communicator.  If you have the opportunity to take one of his classes, you would be wise to do so.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: COMM240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chaplain Jay did a good job- enthusiastic & knowledgeable about the topic and responsive to questions. Expectations for 1st paper & assignments clear, but final project expectations were not as clear, which made group work difficult. Overall, teacher & class are recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2007<br>Class Name: SPCH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Krutz is an amazing teacher and a stand up gent. I wish I had his ability to talk to people like he does. He could read you like a book, I loved his class because it was the first class i have enjoyed.

Do not take him, the guy likes to play head games and power play big time.

Passive agressive at times.  Sort of in your face from a lazy-boy.
