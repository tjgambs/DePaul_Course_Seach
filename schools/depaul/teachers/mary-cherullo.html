Pros= nice workload, don't use the text much, fair grades.  Con= no break through 3hr class (talks from 6-9 nonstop)...would make it so boring!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2007<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great course... Mary is so fair.  my papers were taken and graded with honesty, or at least I felt they were.  Points awarded for working not just content of papers.  Lesson plan projects need to be done well and youre golden.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2005<br>Class Name: TL525<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Plus: Frinedly, bright, interested in the material, kind.  Minus: The text is expensive and largely irrelevant to the course. She doesn't practie what she preaches. There are no real discussions. Instead, students say a few sentences, she eagerly cuts them off and then elaborates for 10 minutes. Most student's demos were dreadful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: TL525<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice prof. Good atmosphere. Decent/relevant content. Fair assignments. As long as you do the work and put some effort into it, then you will be fine. She's an actual teacher, so she knows what she is talking about. Discussions and lectures can drag on, but overall the class was fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2005<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mary Cherullo is WONDERFUL!  She is a very funny and friendly lady, and she keeps the class interesting!  She also takes a special interest in what every person in class has to say.  The amount of work isn't terrible, either.</div></div></div></body></html>
