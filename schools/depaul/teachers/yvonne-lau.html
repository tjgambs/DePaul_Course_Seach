I have no clue why she is scored so low.  Yes there were a lot of readings, and she can be a little boring during her lectures, but I absolutely love Prof. Lau.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2012<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's incredibly kind hearted and wants you to do well in her class. She is really personable and wants to get to know you. The class I had was INCREDIBLE, so key to succeeding: Do the work, follow her instructions word for word, and participate. It's common sense, but the class can be really fun if everyone is willing to make the best of it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was very interesting. The papers were pretty heavy kn the word count, but were easy if you followed the guidelines. If you take this class follow the syllabus. Everything you need to pass is seriously right there.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2012<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was a god awful teacher never take this if you value ur gpa</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with most other students here. Obviously she knows many generalizations about Asian Americans in general but did not teach the materials very well. No matter how hard I studied, I she gave me a B-. One time, she gave me  10/25 on one of the major writing assignments even though I spent hours writing this paper. NOT RECOMMENDED</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No matter how hard I tried, I earned only up to C. I thought I was going to fail. Unless if you're planning to major in Asian American studies, then I recommend not having her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>&quot;The Honest Reviewer&quot; By the time you people see this post, its already too late and you have already enrolled yourself in &quot;Explore Chicago: Asian Communities.&quot; She is very knowledgeable like many have stated. However, her lectures have no life, thus creating a problem for students to keep their eyes open in class. Overall, 2/10.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2009<br>Class Name: HIST101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Helpless and Stupid.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lau is extremely knowledgeable about Asian American topics; however, the way she presented the material made it very difficult to learn.  She gives alot of work for only a 10 week class, but the way she teaches is very vague; students never know what the main points are.  The course would be much better if she was more organized.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lau is not good at teaching. It's obvious she is knowledgeable about the subject, but she is boring and is convinced everyone is **** against Asians. While teachers should be tough on students, she expected 300 level work out of this 100 level class. She gave ridiculous, tedious and useless assignments with no instruction. Avoid her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was the only African American in a class about Asian Americans  and all the information was new to me. I never gave much thought to the struggles of Asians but the class opened my eyes to the challenges they encountered and continue to face daily. I'm so happy I concluded my time here at DePaul with this course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I do not know what everyone is talking about. Professor lau is a wonderful professor. She is definitely one of my favorite professors that i have taken so far. Professor lau cares about her students, and how they do in the class. She always keeps the class entertaining, making everyone want to participate. She is a wonderful teacher!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst class I have ever taken.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2007<br>Class Name: ISP100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>terrible</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're about to take her class, DROP IT WHILE YOU STILL CAN! Her lectures go in circles, make no sense, and have nothing to do with the final. The 10 page research paper (excluding the research) is TERRIBLE. The topic doesn't even make sense (not to mention the bad job she does explaining it). Oh, BTW I'm Asian too if you were wondering.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the hardest of all my classes and it is a first year requirement. When she eventually did explain our final project (1 week before it was due) she expected us to do way too much.  We had to write a 10 page minimum paper on research we had done on a community. Then on top of that we had to take a ridiculous final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was the worst and hardest teacher that I  could ever imagine. I had her for a first year first quarter class and we were expected to do the work of a much higher level student. Every week we had to turn in single spaced journals on the class before and a blog on blackboard. We had a final project AND a final exam! Both of which she didn't expln</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2007<br>Class Name: ISP100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not good</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2007<br>Class Name: SOCSECT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i liked this teacher. i took her for 2 classes, and got 2 A's. it does seem like she asks too much of u. we did campaign coverage, which was probably the hardest (only cause it was so cold and snowy at the time). she gives u a guideline for the final paper, just follow it. and the final could be ruff, but payin attention really helps out with it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2006<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY VERY VERY (i repeat VERY) boring!! She thinks everyone cares about what she has to say. Nothing at all was interesting. She needs to find a better way to teach. CANNOT read her writing either!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the hardest teacher. of my 3 classes, this i thought would be the easiest, by far it is the hardest. she makes you write and read so much every week. we have to write a 2 page journal entry on class discussions. is not clear. does not explain well. final is ridiculous.project,powerpoint,12pg final paper, and a final test. too much work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lacked clarity in the explanation of projects even after questions.

She is such a caring teacher. I took her class twice. She lets you eat in class and its ok if you come in late. Just make sure that you are there and participate. She can be a little boring because her voice is a bit monotone but she is really smart. take her class! you get food!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2005<br>Class Name: COS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is VERY easy to talk to, doesn't matter wut the topic is.

She can be boring at times but her class is very easy so take advantage of it. She allows food in class and generally is open minded to discuss random issues relating to race and ethnicity (mainly Asian American). Overall, take her courses if you want to learn some facts of Asian Americans</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2005<br>Class Name: SOCIOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found her boring, and there is a lot of reading to be done.
