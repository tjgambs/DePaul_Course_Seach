She has made this class so interesting and just makes you want to want to teach and be a teacher. The reading at the beginning is a little much, but if you keep on top of it it is no problem. Class starts out a little rough, but gets easier.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2007<br>Class Name: TANDL404<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers out there!
