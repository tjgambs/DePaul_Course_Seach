She is so nice and really values her students.  Homeworks are not hard and you get to do your own research study!  No midterm or final, just a research paper at the end that you work on throughout the quarter.  Will take her again if I can.  She is clear, cares a lot, and even online her lectures were interesting!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2011<br>Class Name: PSY364<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love this teacher.
