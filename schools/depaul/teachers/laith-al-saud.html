He encourages students to think outside of the box and brings philosophical views as well as historic facts.  This  has been the best class I've taken at Depaul with even better professor.  Take his class, you won't fall asleep, if you do he will make sure everyone in class knows that you are......</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: IWS217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy was actually pretty damn good teacher.  I actually enjoyed going to his classes every week and I'm not fond of school.  He gave extensions on papers even witht he lamest excuses. Lectures were great, great discussions, and just a laid back guy.  3 papers determine your grade and the man gives rewrites.  God Bless HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2005<br>Class Name: REL263<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof.
