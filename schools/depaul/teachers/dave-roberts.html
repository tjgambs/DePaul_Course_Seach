His class is really catered towards your success and preparing you for the CPA exam. His materials are a must-have for studying for the CPA exam after graduation. Not an easy class.  2 tests & 1 paper. He'll tell you what to expect on tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2014<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You gotta go to class and study hard. He does go fast and his "textbook" is basically his fill in the blank lecture notes. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not take again. This guy crams too much material into an exam. So many students did poorly which is why he curved it and even so, many students dropped the class. He is also an old guy so he got irritable at times for minor reasons such as recording his lectures even though he specifically said it was okay to do so. I would NOT take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2014<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not take again. He curves the exams but your gpa will still go down and lots of people dropped and failed. Lousy class. Exams are 100% of grade and use the fill in the blank note packet to study.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2014<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The curve was set so that a C was a 54 on the midterm (same for final), and there were still people that he was encouraging to drop his class. The final only got harder and longer. The textbook is useless, you need to use his version of the textbook which is the note packets. You have to go to class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Need to show up to class to understand what's going on. There is a lot of material that needs to be covered and it really helps if you study very hard from the beginning because you will get lost if you won't keep up with the material. Professor is very good and willing to help. CPA review videos are a must-see! they are VERY helpful when studying!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although sometimes he couldn't talk the materials in a concise and brief way, he's still a very responsible teacher, and he tries his best to make us understand the tax materials better. He's one of the most professional and responsible professors I've ever seen. I really learn a lot from his class and I really appreciate it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a good teacher, very helpful course, his handouts make tax study much easier than reading tax code or textbook by yourself</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor all around - will revisit his notes when I go to study for the CPA exam.  No complaints because it is very straightforward class and deliverables are clearly communicated.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most knowledgable & passionate teachers I have ever had. Felt that my tuition was put to great use. Those Who gave a low rating were probably just lazy.. It's a graduate accounting course, should expect to put in a lot of time studying. To get a passing grade, go to class and make sure u learn the material, don't just memorize it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Though tax is though, he made it simpler. as long as you follow the steps, its easy to pass and get great score</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never learned so much as I have in this class. You have to put good work into the class by studying his handouts, being ready for his quizzes, and I suggest a tape recorder since he talks fast. He is passionate, and I've never been more inspired to consider the CPA exam. I am an MST student, FT worker, and proud of my B for the class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had this professor for Tax I; he was amazing, so I knew I had to take him for Tax II. I was too busy with work, so I could not manage an A for tax II, but that's all on me, though the subject is pretty hard, too. He tells you how to study, and I know that when you do the work outside of class, you get the grade. I'd take him again if I could.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor and very knowledgeable. Tax is a tough subject, and I thought he tried to make it easier to understand. If you attend the class, take good notes and do all the homework, you will pass. The key here is to be prepared and do all the questions. This is the exact way you have to prepare for the CPA exam if you wish to pass it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Roberts made a tough subject a lot easier to learn. I am in the 5-year program and was reluctant to take this course, but after I took Dr. R's course I came out knowing a lot more about corporate tax. Anyone who gives a bad review should rethink their chosen profession because he went out of his way to help students learn this subject.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>after taking this course, Ipassed CPA-reg.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD!! never had a teacher who hates helping out students as much as him. there should be a 0 rating for this guy.

But Prof. Roberts really makes an effort to make the class bearable. He is very precise about what he expects. This class is hard work, if you do all the quizzes and read the handouts then you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Roberts is a very great professor. You can learn a lot from class. Tax is hard but he makes it easy to lean. I really like tax after his two tax courses.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>He is great and helpful. Everyone knows that tax is a very hard stuff. But Professor Roberts makes it easy for me to understand. His exam is exactly relevant to his class handout. If you take efforts to look over his handout, review his class lectures, and do his quizzes on time and understand all the stuff he mentioned about. You will get A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Tax I and II for Professor Roberts. I'm an international student which makes me harder to learn Code. Professor Roberts made the class the easiest way for me to not only understand but also really learn it into my mind. He designed perfect handouts which combined CPA materials  in a easy understanding way. He is awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best tax professor in DePaul. He is a very knowledgeable professor and would able to deliver those knowledge to students as well. Just make sure you understand all the handout and quiz well you will get a good grade!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Strong recommended professor!You will never waste your tuition in his class. David Robert always prepares enough before he coming into the classroom. Tax is a hard course, but he uses his own handouts and gives me a more clarified logic. The exam is exactly follows what he covered in the class and those before-class quizes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is my favorite professor at DePaul who made me felt that I didn't waste my tuition. Doesn't like other professors who just read PPT and do lots of case studys, he always prepares enough before he coming into the class. Tax is a hard course, he uses his own handouts and the exam is exactly follows what he covered in the class and in quizes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's a little hard if you don't know anything about tax or business law. But you can learn a lot especially when the professor keeps pushing you. He even provides useful videos online if you can't get it at class. Tests are easier than what he fed us in class. And you need to really commit to the subjects.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is difficult and a lot of work. You can't expect to do well if you don't attend class, re-read the handouts, re-work the quizzes, and do the questions from the CPA review book required for the class. He is available and helpful outside of class for any questions/concerns. Don't take another prof for a tax class, you won't learn as much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>great teaching.

Everything you need to know regarding his tests are packed neatly in his lecture handouts and weekly quizzes.  I recommend reviewing lecture notes/making note cards each week so you don't fall behind. Topics are tough, but his job is to prepare us for REG CPA exam, so deal with it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>very very good and helpful professor.

Can't assign problems or a decent study guide, mocks your questions, in short, he cannot try to make this any easier for you. Prepare to teach yourself. His booklets are dense and incomprehensible. I learned from reading tax books. Unfriendly and condescending.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2013<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the strongest teachers at DePaul.  Puts a ton of time into making a very hard topic as easy as possible.  If you have any work ethic you will get a good grade.

Actually took it twice,  and still barely passed. His exams are confusing and barely go off the material & he never understands why students are confused, let alone the ?</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2012<br>Class Name: TAX380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor really cares about his students. He gives you all the material and assistance you could need, He is in the office on non class days for additional assistance. The textbooks are optional he tells you about alternative options, you can use older editions. I crammed 12 hours for the Midterm and got a B. He grades it that same night.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2011<br>Class Name: ACC548<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher!!

He thinks students should know everything about TAX before they start the class. He is VERY unclear in explaining the material. His fill in the blank notes are confusing/useless. STAY AWAY!

Very knowledgable in tax, and if you're an accounting student you'll understand the material.  However, his vast knowledge is sometimes his pitfall because he doesn't understand why students can't grasp Sec. 1231 exchanges on their first try.  Also, a HUGE liberal.

He warns you from the beg. you need to know the stuff he goes over very well. He explains everything really well but there is so much he can do for you, you need to do a lot of studying. 50mid 50final.

Started the first class by giving us his professional story (composed mostly of him bragging about his designations). Continuously insulted the class, and did little by way of teaching. His handouts are well organized, but basically just reads them aloud. When someone asked for an example of a concept before the final, he refused.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2010<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly the rudest prof Ive had. Doesn't teach the material, merely reads the packets. Refuses to repeat material, instead shakes his head and makes you feel stupid. Class is difficult to keep up with as he speeds through his packets and material not tested.  He's knowledgeable, but doesn't teach in a manner to help you. Good luck if you have him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I cant believe he is given any positive feedback for 380 when over half of my class Withdrew after the mid-term. He speeds through everything and his test was a complete puzzle. The curve was insane, if you had a 50% you basically had a C. Only 40 questions and nearly half your grade. My only W from DePaul was his class....stay away.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2009<br>Class Name: ACC548<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good professor. Not your typical DePaul one, old school. Has interest in what he does and in teaching. Midterm 100p, final 150p & 2 easy projects. Make sure you attend class. Study his notes. He does not use the textbook. Curves the grades. Easy going and nice guy.

The course requires no accounting experience, no tax law knowledge... There is no textbook, just a few handouts.  He takes attendance.  All you have to do is participate in class, write a paper, and give a 20 minute presentation.  There are no exams.  He usually doesn't let out early.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2009<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor! He knows his material really good...he is not like the other accounting professors that is pushing every single accounting student to go into the Big Four.  Class is hard, but it sometimes keeps you interested.  Notes are everything!  Know the notes and you will do just fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher but talks to fast and the tests is hard but they are everything he teaches in class so nothing is a suprise.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you miss a single class simply don't bother yourself anymore... it's like acc380 just harder and even more knowledge at one time!!! He's a very smart guy and a great teacher but this class is just the toughest ACC class out there PERIOD! I feel sorry for all of the students who need to take it in order to graduate!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG! Final was impossible! He's really good at explaining the material. The midterm is very much like the notes, the final also is, but he mixes concepts together so you need to know everything to be able to interrelate it in the test. I guess it's it's a painfully necessary class...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tax is an extremely difficult subject and Roberts does his best to help you understand. He's extremely passionate about the subject and his subtle humor is interesting. If you do the handouts ahead of class, it makes it 10 times easier to understand while he's teaching it. One of the few A's I got in my accounting classes but it was a lot of work</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2009<br>Class Name: ACC360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His handouts are golden!

He's a little intimidating but he explains things well and you know exactly what's expected of you.  Definitely recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: ACC548<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talks too fast.  Wastes time venting his Bush hatred.  Does not explain things well. Jumps around and does not follow the syllabus so it is difficult to study before hand.  His handouts are ok but poorly formatted.  The one thing I thought he taught well was depreciation recapture.  The book is so-so and the Code is useless.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: ACC360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You'll be intimidated by him at first, but he's awesome. Tax is ridiculously boring, but he actually makes an effort to liven it up a bit. The packets are the key to success. Memorize them inside and out and you'll get an A on both the midterm and final... final is harder, though! Overall, great class, great professor... take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2008<br>Class Name: ACC548<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough, but overall, fair. You have to consistently do the work in this class and use all of the materials available to you. Too much detail material to cram for final. He is an entertaining, and VERY knowledgeable instructor, makes himself available, etc. About as lively as a tax class is going to get. Final harder than midterm. DON'T miss classes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2008<br>Class Name: ACC360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>David Roberts was a great professor.  All the material you need is contained in packets he gives you.  All you need to study for the midterm and final are these packets and some practice quizzes he gives.  Aside from that, he is very knowledgeable, and his lecutres are actually interesting.  Definitely the professor to take for 360.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: ACC548<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He talks really fast and doent give student a chance to ask questions.  Goes over alot of information not on the test.  I believe instead for rushing threw every topic, he should focus on the valuable information(whats on the test) and slow down so his student can ask questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: ACC360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good professor.  as long as you study the notes you should be fine.  also study the practice quizzes that he gives out at the beginning of every class.  1 ethics paper and 1 tax research assignment which are pretty easy.  very nice and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2007<br>Class Name: CPA000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2007<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a taxation class, and I was very skeptical at first but to my surprise I actually learned a lot and enjoyed the class. You have to give a 15min presentation, write a paper about your presentation, and then write another paper for the take home final. No tests, no midterm, but you do need to attend class, not bad though...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: ACC360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's a tax class, obviously hard. He knows his stuff and makes it as easy as possible. Tells you what might be on the exam. Final, midterm, mini-essays only. Book is only needed for advanced prep. Very knowledgable about the subject, funny yet specific sense of humor. Definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2007<br>Class Name: ACC360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved him! Yes, very hard - its tax, the subject is hard regardless of the professor, he made it interesting, if you are a tax person or plan for CPA - Take him, great teacher.

He hands out numerous 20 page packets for notes for the m/t and final.  It is pretty annoying that he spends a LOT of time on things that he will later tell you are not on the tests.  You really need to go to his class to find out what is or is not on the test.  Memorize his notes and a B is really not that hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: ACC360<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>MIDTERM, FINAL. HARD AND deceiving. Weekly quizzes are nothing like his midterm and final... 10X harder... must know every single tax rule... its just not suitable for 10 weeks and unfortunaterly thats just how depaul is... study your ass off week after week... i put in 15hrs a week 30hrs for midterm and final  and ended up with a c+... sucks</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: ACCTTAX1<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a peace of work.   The first thing he told us besides the fact that he worked for the IRS is that hes got a LAW Degree which he got at the same time as his MBA and CPA.

Hardest tests ever! I have never gotten a C before in my life (and neither had the majority of my class). He is not helpful when you ask questions.
