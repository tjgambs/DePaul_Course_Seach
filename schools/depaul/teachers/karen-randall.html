She teaches you something, most often made up, then tells you to not worry about it, because what you will be tested on is the book def.  She should be fired.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WOW is all i can say, randall is a sorry excuse for a professor. everything that people say are true, she recites the book, tests on obscure word for word dry details from the book, big attitude, hates life, etc etc. i have never been close to being so disappointed in a class.  an absolute shame that this teacher is allowed to teach. flat out sucks</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2006<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST TEACHER EVER! SHE'LL KEEP YOU UNTILL 9:15 IF YOU HAVE A NIGHT CLASS WITH HER. SHE DESERVES TO BE FIRED! REGURGETATES THE BOOK! THERE ARE SO MANY BETTER PROFESSORS AT DEPAUL. STAY AWAY.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The current comments are a little biased. If you pay attention to her lectures, she'll point out what will be on the mid-term/final. Sure, her study guides are a little pointless, but make sure to study each model she draws on the board and everything that she says &quot;WILL BE ON THE TEST.&quot; Ignore the study guide, review your lecture notes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Randall is the worst teacher I've ever had in my life.  Her lectures are word-for-word reading out of the text.  Test are on obscure and irrelevant factoids.  Gives students a study guide and then doesn't ask any questions from it.  She is late every class and appears to be quite miserable - the class is negative, depressing and a fraud.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2006<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Run and hide people!  I've never rated a professor in 4 years at DePaul but I owe you this.  She is not a bad person but it is seriously one of the worst classes I've ever had.  Boring is an understatement and she is completely unprepared reading right off the slides.  Midterm and Final are hard and not from the class lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2006<br>Class Name: MARKETING310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of two unacceptable teachers I've had at DePaul.  She doesn't lecture she reads off of chapter summaries from teachers ed.  The class seems easy until you take the tests- which ask the most obscure questions, nothing ever discussed.  Do yourself a favor and wait for a more qualified teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>2 exams, a group paper, a presentation AND 2 quizzes on top of everything else. also, she takes attendance very seriously so try not to miss too many classes. i wouldn't say that she's horrible, but at the same time she's not that good either. i personally have mixed feelings about her. good luck to everyone who's taking this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: MKT315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an OK teacher - not that bad. Takes FOREVER to get your grade though</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2005<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitly doesn't make Marketing enjoyable. Uses slides from the teachers ed. My advice: print out the slides from blackboard and you don't need to come to class, except on days where she tells you what's on the exams. Extremely boring. Says &quot;alright&quot; after every sentence. Gets anoying real quick.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2005<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THIS TEACHER WAS AMONG THE BEST I HAVE HAD A DEPAUL. SHE ACTUALLY MADE MARKETING FUN. NOT HARD AT ALL, TERM PAPER, IF YOU FOLLOW DIRECTIONS YOU WILL GET AN A. SHE GIVES EXTRA CREDIT ON ALL EXAMS IF, YOU STUDY YOU WILL BE FINE.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everyone that had trouble with this professor didnt come to class and didnt study. She tells you exactly what to study for on the exams and is very specific about what she wanted in the big term paper. The only reason she seemed unprepared was because depaul hired her 2 weeks before the wtr qtr.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2005<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very insecure about herself so she takes it out on her students.  Tries to feel powerful by giving out difficult tests and downgrading people. I would never take her again, if I could I would drop her but its too late. Wants you to fail so she feels better about her miserable life.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2005<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>beyond horrible, you would make the biggest mistake taking her, she is horrible--im honest, i've never had a C in my life and seems she will give me one, you could tell she's not married--if you know what i mean !! you might think its funny but on her it shows.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2005<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not very prepared or enthusiastic.  It just seems like she releats what is on the slide show, which isnt even her slides, they came with the teachers edition.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2005<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She totally does not seem like she cares about the class. She did not pre-order the book for the class, can not get her blackboard set up, uses the book's powerpoints, and does not respond to e-mails Randal is extremely unclear of her expectations for tests and offers no study guide. Don't take her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2005<br>Class Name: MARKETING310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's into the material so that makes what could be a boring class intresting.  She requires that you participate but that's not hard to do considering the questions are basically everyday things you deal with. I'd defintely take her again if I needed to.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
