She works hard to make sure that you get it. If you don't like hard work don't waste her time. If you put forth the effort you will do very well. She is a fair grader and grades on improvement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a bad teacher, but really strict over the board. Expects you to come up with something right away when she calls on you. Homework is really easy you just need to do the homework, but it's due like every other day. I thought it was too much work for me to handle.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Impossible...RUN!!! I'm not a girl, and I haven't cried since I had to have a root canal done when I was 10, however remembering the pain this professor caused me almost brings tears into my eyes. I am an above avergage student who would have a 3.0 if it wasn't for Howsam. I now have a 2.6 and am fighting to keep my scholorship.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>in my opinion she should be out of work and whoever hired her should be too...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Howsam is an excellent teacher! Though she's demanding in class and has little patience for students not willing to put forth effort and improve. However, she WANTS you to learn and will take an interest in your writing if you genuinely want help. she is helpful with her e-mails and quick to identify places in essays that can be improved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow I sure am surprised at the number of negative comments about Prof. Howsam! Honestly, she was a hard and demanding professor, I agree there, but she also was very rewarding; I had a very positive experience with her and with the class, it's really made me a better writer (and I'm a computer networking major!)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor definitley expects a lot from a first year student. She's a friendly person when you are with her one on one, but be prepared to be crewed out on paper/emails. The class consisted of 3 papers & about 25 journals. The journals r easy if you keep up with them and actually do them on time. Papers are hard, but she grades on imrovement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never had such a bad experience in english before. This teacher ruined my grade and left 70% of the grade to be determined for the final. If your writing is not what she expects, then be ready to fail. She gave me a D in her class and left our whole class to fail. DO NOT TAKE HER SHE WILL RUIN YOUR ENGLISH CAREE, BIG MISTAKE!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Demands a lot for final portfolio and grades very hard on essays.  Average grades for papers are C's, D's and F's but Grades on progress.  3 papers and about 25 journals are assigned throughout class.  She's nice but is not as helpful as one would want.  If you are looking for an easier writing class, don't take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was a very good teacher. The assignments are not vague if you pay a bit of attention in class... she repeats the assignment OVER and OVER again. So if you still don't get it you're just not listening. There are a lot of journals to write but they are easy and take barely any time at all. I HATE writing but I didn't mind this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She comes off so nice in class, but outside of class she is a different person! She is very negative and has the broadest assignments! I never was approved because I didn't answer the assignments correctly, like I was supposed to read her mind&#63;! Lots and lots of busy work! I worked so hard in this class and failed miserably! AVOID IF POSSIBLE!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not reccommend taking this teacher.  She is extremely vague about what she wants you to do and expects you to be able to read her mind.  Also, she may seem nice in class, but when she sends e-mails, she turns into this condescending demon.  Very negative and gives more work than other teachers.  Avoid if possible!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had a horrible time trying to find out what she wanted me to write about. She is not clear about what she wants in your papers but you do drafts so you can't be afraid to ask questions until you get the assignment. In the end I'm probably a better writer but I would get very angry about the assignments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very helpful and nice, the class was fun and everyone participated.  I would recomend her to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tons of pointless work that just consumes too and is very broad on subjects yet expects you to be narrow in your paper. Avoid if possible</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>O she is awesome. The journals, if you've ever had to write them in previous classes, are quite simple and never take more than a half hour of your time. She only excpects that you take the time to show you understood what you read, which is easy reading. These actually are a big help in your final grade. She  makes class as interesting as possible</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great passion for subject!! interesting take on homework and readings. great presentation of self. Loves to get everyone involved. TOTALLY CARES WHAT STUDENT THINKS INDIVIDUALLY!! always wants the best from each student!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher. You do have a lot of writing assignments, but they all help with the whole learning process. The journals are annoying, but they are easy points. She is very helpful and always available when you need her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher but you get a lot of what seems like busy work.  Her explanations of projects are very vague and confusing at times but you revise them sooo much that you have to get it eventually.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher; yes, she does get difficult, and there is a Lot of work (I'm coming from the IB program - and I still find it to be a lot). Lots of reflection BS and other stuff, but all in all a graet, fun class that'll leave you better prepared for college writing than any of the others. Definitely worth taking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good teacher bad subject</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly she seems nice at first until the first few weeks kick in then all the sudden she gets harder and meaner.  One of the first things I noticed is that she seems to either come in hung-over half the time or baked like no other.  Compared to some of the other english teachers at DePaul she seems to give the most work.  Would avoid if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
