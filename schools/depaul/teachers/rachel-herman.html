She sometimes lectures for too long & can go off on tangents, but means well. Seemed to rub some students wrong way with her quirkiness or perhaps her disapproval of rudeness/distractions. Admirable, but firm.  Most photo skills/inspiration came from artist studio visits, not lessons.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2015<br>Class Name: LSP210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Rachel taught my freshman year Discover Chicago: Photographig Chicago class. She has a lot of quirky traits and tries to be overly deep about everything. You won't learn anything about how to photograph, but you will visit many photographers studios and make a photobook of all of your photos as your final. Overall, easy A, but Rachel is strange...</div></div></div></body></html>
