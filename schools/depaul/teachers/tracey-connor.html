All coursework is really easy and you must remember deadlines. I took this class for granted and kind of blew it off because it was easy. Exams are pretty easy as long as you put info on your notecard. However, I didn't put a lot of work into the paper and ended up with an A- There is no textbook.  Take LSP 120 online not in person</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tracey was great. She replied  to emails quickly and was very helpful. Although I took an online class and mostly taught myself, when I had questions she helped, she made everything with grading and due dates clear, and was very timely on feedback. I would take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class online and it was a lot better than I expected. Take this if you have a busy schedule and like to work on your own time. Tracey is very helpful and she always answered emails quickly. The work was not too bad either. She outlines the assignments very clearly. I would definitely take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tracey is a great teacher. She wants student to do well and is totally understanding.  DePaul should be proud to have her. Her class is easy, simple, and organized. She uses the simplest way to explain things and everything will make sense to you. Love her.  Tracey, thank you for waiting for me to finish my final exam.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her online course was awesome!  She gives you so much help with lsp, gives times for student tutoring (do it!) and you have as many chances to complete the quizzes as you want until you get a 100.  TAKE HER IF YOU HATE MATH AND WANT TO GRADUATE</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Less work than the classroom version of this course.  If you hate a group work take this online class.  I failed LSP once with a horrible teacher (would not mention her name now), but Tracey is awesome. She is so organized and cares about her students. Take this class. Thank you Tracey.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2011<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her online class. Awesome professor, she's always willing to help you. I despise math, but this class was not that bad. Take her class if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate math, but Tracey made it bearable. She is very helpful, supportive and kind. If you can, take her online class-you won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate math. This class is all following instructions. Yes, there was a lot of yelling at the computer screen, but Professor Connor's instructions helped immensly. If you ever have questions, she emails back right away. I got a B+, and again, I am terrible at math. Just a lot of work, that's all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/04/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So I waited to my summer before Senior Year to take this class because I dreaded it so much! It is such a ridiculous class - especially for a math major - however she made it really painless. She is helpful,  lenient on the work, and tries to incorporate everyday situations. Bad in math--take her! Good in math - she won't insult your intelligence!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SOOO helpful. Will go out of her way to help you. Really nice and understanding. Definitely suggest you take her. I took her for an online class and I learned the stuff all on my own when I am terrible at math because she has really detailed notes and explains things really well. Recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Connor is super nice. I took her online class for ISP 120 and it was so easy. She is very lenient on late work. I turned in most of my work the day before the final. Very nice teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a really good teacher, adn she'll understand if you don't get everything right away. She's very lenient and is always willing to help you get a good grade. Love her, very low stress class, and i suck at math. lol</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2007<br>Class Name: HON180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>was a great teacher who got someone interested in math that hated math.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: HON180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very straight-forward, sweet lady. Doesn't care when you turn in your homework as long as you let her know ahead of time. Lectures were unclear some of the time, but she's very approachable & willing to answer questions. I wasn't too familiar with Excel before this class, but she made using it super easy. Turned a boring subject into a fun class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/15/2006<br>Class Name: HON180<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very sweet person, ALWAYS willing to give extra help outside of class and answer questions. Only problem was that her lectures usually required a lot of question-asking afterwords, as they were fast-paced and not very informative. Free-reign on the statistics projects make them somewhat interesting if you're willing to go the extra mile.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2006<br>Class Name: HON180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tracey is by far the most helpful, informative, and engaging professor I have had so far in my college career! She actually made statistics interesting! I also loved her class because she talked about her other passions, a major one being marine biology and the like. She was SO helpful and was SUPER flexible on due dates! You can't go wrong w/ her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2006<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHe is awesome.

Tracey somehow makes you not want to kill yourself while you are in it though.  She explains things and then lets you go whenever you are done with your work.  Very cool lady</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is a nightmare for anyone mathematically inept.To make matters worse, if one doesn't pass the final they don't pass the class.I've never stressed so much for a class in my life! However, towards the end in particular, she was so accomodating & helpful.She was really dedicated to helping me pass(a rarity).Very nice,very sweet,very helpful</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: ISP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She deals with a lot of****, people don't respect her in class, and you can tell she is very nice. She is a little disorganized and dosen't understand the questions you ask all of the time, and talks about fish a lot but is very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2005<br>Class Name: ISP110AND120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tracey is incredibly nice, and is usually really relaxed with deadlines and accepts almost any excuse.  Classes are boring, but hey it's math.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is horrible and boring.  Tracey is nice and wants to help, however with the large class size this is hard and her teaching assistant does not know ANYTHING, don't ask him for help! Overall, class was horrible and a bit challenging, teacher was okay but not the best explaining the material...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate hate hate hated this class, but Professor Conner is fabulous.  She is extremely understanding when it comes to helping you and she does her best to explain things.  She tries not to make the class boring.  Still think I did bad because I wasn't interested in material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class sucked.  Tracy is a cool teacher and tries to explain everything, but sometimes does not do it to the greater extent.  Its not her fault, but the class sux all in all.  i would take her again but thats if i had too...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great teacher. Definately Take Her! Class was alright. She really cares about her students and is always willing to help you out if you have any problems. Very nice and sweet.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2005<br>Class Name: ISP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tracy is a very sweet lady. The problem is, in ISP 110 she had to deal with a bunch of math idiots (including me). No matter how good she taught, most of what she said was over our heads. She tried her best and gave lots of extra credit to make up for poor tests. If you have to take it, take Tracy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In this class she doesn't really teach at all.  She will go over something on the board once, but you pretty much do all of your work on the computer.  If you need extra help she's willing to help out, but during class you have so much busy work that she doesn't have enought time to lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2005<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seems like a nice person, but she also seems very bored while teaching the class. Breezes through things assuming you know them and is generally unclear. Class is still pretty easy, but I'd take a diff. professor if I could do it again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2005<br>Class Name: QUAN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The easiest class ever and I hate computers.

Tracy Connor was nice and willing to help and work with me, but it didn't help. She didn't explain things clearly, and the class was very boring. I liked her as a person, but not as a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
