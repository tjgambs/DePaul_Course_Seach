While she is very dedicated, and fair in grading, her class has taught me a lot. While I could complain and badmouth, I have to say in the end Pat pushed every student to do their best. In the end I can say I got what I put into it. I liked her, if you are looking for easy, do not take this.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2012<br>Class Name: HUM101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is among the worst. After silly snide comments on returned papers and corrections which are conflicting themselves, I ended up telling her to just fail me. She seems to like to pass some and make examples of others. Best of luck if you take her class... Don't say you were not warned.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2012<br>Class Name: HC182<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is psycho. She allows one to choose their final, then sends it back for 12 revisions. The worst part, she will bring your grade down and not accept your work until she feels it is complete. She is insulting and her directions completely contradict each other. Avoid like the plague unless you have nothing better to do but write papers.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
