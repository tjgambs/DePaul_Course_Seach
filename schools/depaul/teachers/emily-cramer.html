She is nice and offers any help when you need it. Also, there are a lot of presentations that you must do in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/12/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE HER!!! Great class! Great professor! I wish all professors at DePaul were like Emily. Definitely recommend!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm a philosophy major and at first thought this was going to be a frou-frou class but Prof Cramer really has a way of making the subject engaging and significant.  She's unbelievably nice and energetic and fun and just really wants you to learn, which I think is the best quality a prof can have.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2010<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher, keeps the class open and vivid.  Sometimes working in groups is frustrating and it's hard to know where you're at because you're ultimately dependent on three or four other people but I liked the class overall.  Emily rules.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2010<br>Class Name: CMN0000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really laid back and gets the whole class engaged in group activities. I looked forward to going to class, which is unusual for me. A few group projects here and there that aren't too hard, and one large one at the end (and throughout the course). I'd take another one of her classes for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING PROFESSOR! She really makes the class a LOT of fun & keeps it interesting. I actually looked forward to going to class. There are a lot of assignments and a TON of group work, but they are easy. No tests, no midterm, no final. Just a bunch of small things & 1 BIG project at the end. And its not hard... I got an easy A. HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2009<br>Class Name: CMMS212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher. The project at the end is pretty hard and takes a lot of time. This class has a lot of assignments so be prepared to work. If you are looking for a cool teacher for communications she is awesome but if you're looking for a laid back workload this is not it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was super nervous about taking a communications course but Emily makes the classroom atmosphere so warm and welcoming! One large group project which does take a lot of time and gets a little overwhelming with the amount of work towards the end, but other than that the class was really fun and interesting! Take her if you can!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
