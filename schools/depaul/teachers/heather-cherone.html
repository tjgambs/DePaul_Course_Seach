Her grading is fair and makes sense. She brings real-life experience of being a journalist into the classroom and I PROMISE IT IS SO REWARDING! Plus, she is willing to help you find internships.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2013<br>Class Name: JOUR278<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty difficult News Writing class. That said, Heather is fair, this isn't supposed to be easy. Learn AP style and how to interview. Go to her for help if you're struggling. I ended up with a B+, I learned a lot and I keep my final feature assignment in my portfolio.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2012<br>Class Name: JOUR275<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ridiculous. Cherone's expectations for an intro-level class are way too high. Be prepared to be constantly swamped with work, randomly quizzed, harshly graded, and treated like her class is the only one that you're taking.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2012<br>Class Name: JOUR275<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her expectations were pretty unreasonable considering this is an intro class. She's really knowledgeable though. A lot of the students didn't like her but my biggest issue were the current event quizzes each class, it was a long shot to get every question right because she sometimes picked random questions. Take her if you want a challenge.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2012<br>Class Name: JOUR275<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Count on being frustrated. As an A student, I was constantly getting Bs Cs and even Ds.. even on the first assignment which was to explain why we are taking the class (simple right?). She also gave all these grammar assignments that if you didn't correct each sentence correctly, you get points off. So basically she set you up to fail.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: JOURN275<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cherone is def. one of a kind. Extremely difficult prof. considering she teaches an intro class. Don't take unless you want to consume all your study time with her class! You'll have HW & quizzes everyday & she honestly grades depending on the mood she is in. A lot of people disliked her and the way she taught. Impossible to get an A..seriously!!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
