The material is not EASY, however she makes the course EASY by making learning fun & interesting, and by being CLEAR about exactly what she expects from you as a student. She is inspiring and is extremely organized.

She is super friendly and approachable. The class material is really interesting and all of the work is straightforward and very manageable. She even helped me get a great internship which was an added bonus! She's awesome and so is the class so I encourage everyone to take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: ORG251<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kristin is an amazing teacher.  I would recommend if you have to take ORG 251 you take it with Kristin.  Her lectures are very simple, she posts the outlines on D2L and there's only 1 major writing assignment.  Do the readings and participate in class and you'll be fine.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
