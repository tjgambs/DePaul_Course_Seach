He wears a full suit, slicks back his salt-n-pepper hair, and speaks as if he is dictating an article for the New Yorker. That being said, I learned a lot and enjoyed the class.

I was not. There are certainly worse professors, but I didn't find this course particularly helpful or formative. Unless you very much value tossing snippy jibes back and forth. Then by all means go for it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mar****is a class act. He's direct and honest with you about your work and only looks to help you. Also, don't let his impeccable style fool you - he's such a goofball. Best class I've taken at DePaul - fun, interesting, and SO helpful if writing's your schtick. Just take him and prepare to work hard and be dazzled - trust me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: ENG292<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He will tell you on the first day of class if you want someone to like your poetry give it to your mom.

A must take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: ENG272<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>is planning on leaving depaul thank freakin jesus christ on a bicycle. if you are devoted to the word, aovid this man. he will suck the love right out of it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2009<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He just wasn't that interesting, and it kind of seemed like he was going through the motions when teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2009<br>Class Name: ENG254<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an absolutely wonderful and motivating professor.  He helps you see so many different angles of the literature you read.  He sets you up for greatness, because he himself is very versed in his subject.  All you have to do is show up for class and be attentive and engaged in his discussion.  He makes class fun and easy to come to!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2008<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>first things first: he's hot.  i seriously get distracted during class. he's also very well spoken. i'm an english major but have no background in poetry and found his class VERY difficult. you think you kind of get it, but then he gives you your quiz grades. you cannot pass this class unless you actually read and study.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2008<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>oops. i meant section 220. not 272.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2008<br>Class Name: ENG272<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was amazed as he lectured on the books. I fell in love with his thinking. Very great lectures. If you love talking literature...this is your class.  Just attend class, take notes, read and THINK. He gives very fair quizzes-nothing much of a surprise. His mid-term was quite a load to tackle though.But if you read carefully-no worries. No regrets.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2008<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>People in these comments seem to find Mar****arrogant or conceited. I just don't see it. He's nice! His midterm kicked my ass, though. The difficulty level seemed a bit inappropriate and the other students in my class were shocked as well. So-- be warned. But arrogant, rude, demeaning&#63; Nah- I think he's super-cool. You'd be lucky to get him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2008<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an amazing professor!  Prof. Mar****probably is one of the most intelligent and witty professors I have had thus far.  You have to be serious about the subject and attend classes to understand the material.  Quizzes every week or so but still most amazing class I have taken.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2008<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>can a girl get a mug of this prof&#63; love the dude. im only in my second class and im in love. he is amazing. and writes books. omg. love the dude more than any other professor.

I personally had a hard time sitting through the class though.  I found his lectures pompous and self-indulging, and while the context was helpful, it's hard to muck through the rest of his rhetoric.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Getting an A = go to class, pay attention, go to office hours.  Mar****rewards students who show up and engage the material by creating the most fair quiz/tests ever.  Papers are graded extremely reasonably.  If you show an interest and are a good writer, it is no problem to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2007<br>Class Name: ENG272<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very intelligent guy.  He really knows his stuff and if you pay attention in his class it's not ridiculously difficult.  He's also really helpful and understanding but he doesn't take any ****.  Straight forward, good professor, I'd take him again</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a  really good professor. He tries his best to keep the class interesting and the discussions are on recent events that anyone can relate to. He may come off as strict in the beginning but stick around and you'll find out that its not just another boring class after all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2007<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You get what you put into his class. If you want to get an A then you have to work hard. Not a class for slackers. Very arrogant, but at times could be amusing. Make sure to go to office hours!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2007<br>Class Name: ENG308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marcum challenges you. He is a great teacher for advanced writers and he will honestly tell you when you suck but at the same time he will encourage to pursue writing and give you great advice. I think he could be clearer in his class expectations. I do think his arrogance gets in the way of helping students and stops them from asking questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2007<br>Class Name: ENG272<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While intimidating at first, Marcum is actually hilarious once you get to know him. He can come off as an ethnocentric ****, but what he lacks in humbleness he makes up for in literacy. Sometimes he seemed like he was only teaching at DePaul because he didn't get the job anywhere else...but he did graduate from Stanford.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: MULT200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Besides from being absolutely gorgeous he is absolutely arrogant, but he is a poet and that is how poets go... The class I was in wasn't very active but his passion kept it semi-interesting... he likes to over pronounce spanish words so you get the hint that hes &quot;latino&quot;... just giggle to yourself and you'll get through it</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG292<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marcum's a great guy and a great professor if you are serious about writing.  He's not a professor to take if you are a mediocre writer or dont care about writing.  He's super helpful and available out of class and cares about each student's ability to progress in their writing.  If he's rude it's only because you're wasting the classes time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2006<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While Marcum is arrogant he's still an awesome teacher. Just because you take a creative writing class doesnt mean you have the talent to actually write. Marcum won't bullsh*t you about that. He cares about writing and pushes you to be a better writer. He wont coddle you and his bluntness is tough love!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2006<br>Class Name: WR101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely arrogant and rude. very unhelpful</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Initially, this man is very intimidating due to his arrogant aura.

I, as did most in my class found him to be extremely arrogant. While this is a creative writing class he has failed to teach us the proper skills necessary to write in such a way. He still has a good personality and his classes are never boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are an Eng major, and enjoy writing, definitely take this class.

He truly is a great professor and there wasn't a single class that went by where the students seemed bored. Marcum makes you want to think and expand your mind, he knows how to teach and is 100% worth your time and money!! Professors like him are rare, don't miss your chance!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teaches only his own ideals.

Carl Marcum is a big fan of Carl Marcum.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher with a great personality. You wont have to listen closely because he is one of very few professors that can project his voice clear and far. Class was great recommend to all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very funny, very overdramatic.  Interesting prof, picks good reading material.  Genuinely concerned with his students' progress.  If you considering creative writing very important, take this guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you actually TRY and have a desire to write, then take the class. If you want an easy A or are reluctantly taking it as a required class, then change your attitude. He's a nice guy and very helpful if you show the effort. If you don't, he won't either.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2004<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away.  The guy's a jerk.  Picks favorite students and ignore everyone else.  Doesn't really read papers, just skims them.  He should go teach at SIU.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you're prepared to teach yourself-have at it. he is definitely conceited and chooses favorites or at least singles people out to pick on. also noticed he has a terrible habit of making fun of and putting down of his students. he has a sense of humor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2003<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher!

He has a way of explaining things that makes you really understand it.  The only thing is that he is really full of himself and it gets annoying at times.  It is funny to imitate him though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2003<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Strange man...yet pretty funny.

Helped me on my paper a lot and was always in his office to help. Was very cool and had a strange, yet funny sense of humor.
