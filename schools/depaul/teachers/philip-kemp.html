Only thing is do well on those weekly quizzes!  Great to talk to outside of class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough but fair teacher.  If you really want to learn something take him.  He makes class fun and the topic interesting.  Show up to class on time.  He gives quizes every week but gives you one min. after to discusses answers with your classmates.  TAKE HIM AND LEARN SOMETHING!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: ICS200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unfair as hell.....too much work....you'll bust ass for a C-, or B</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor knows his subject very well.  Has a good sense of humor and will explain any questions until you understand them.  Would definitely take another class with him.  His quizzes and exams are easy if you've read the material and paid attention in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor, very tough. Grades very hard, no curve, and weekly quizzes are very hard even if you read them. You will do soooo much work for a B- or C. Only 2 people got A's out of 40 in the class. He makes class hard with alot of work compared to other professors like O'Keefe. Not recommended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All you have to due is do the readings since all the tests are based from that.

A lot of his quizzes are take-home...easy 100%  Just follow the his sample scans (papers) as guidelines and you should be fine.  And don't be late to class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would agree with most of the people he is a hard grader, the quizzes are not that hard if you read CAREFULLY 2 paper assignments which are fairly easy if you follow his guidelines, overall he makes the class interesting because he knows his stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor.  He actually knows what he is talking about and you might think he rambles on but it never gets boring.  He will keep you for the whole entire time you are there, but he makes it interesting.  He is pretty hard when it comes to grading, because he gives quizes every week and the quizes you must pass.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the worst professor ever! For some reason he tries to make his class as hard as it can possibly be. Thinks that he is 10 times smarter than everybody else. Don't take him. =(</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He sucks, to much work and all the stuff he teaches in class is absolutely worthless for the midterm or the final.  Don't take him, he tries to show off how smart he is but if you read the wall street journal in the morning you can upstage that faker in a second.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HARD WEEKLY QUIZES ON MATERIAL BEFORE YOU GO OVER IT IN CLASS. A COUPLE OF PROJECTS. HARD MIDTERM AND FINAL. PROFESSOR IS ANAL, SARCASTIC AND ISNT VERY SYMPATHETIC TO ANYTHING. YOU PROBABLY WON'T PASS WITH AN A OR B, BUT YOU'LL WORK UR ASS OFF TO GET A C. LOTS OF WORK AND READING.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: ICS200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is awesome! He is an older gentleman that is set in his ways. I found him extreemely amusing. He is very anal, and not very flexible, but you always know exactly what his expectations are. He tells funny stories, and his sarcasm rocks! Definately take this professor!!! Good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is only one thing I disliked about Kemp and this course: Midterm and final are 100-question multiple-choice exams. Long, boring, and do not test your knowledge. Each quiz (there is one every week), the midterm, and final are just questions that test whether or not you've memorized the words/phrases in the book. Memorize, and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at DePaul. Acutally makes you work, but is extremely fair. Highly recommend Kemp for the intro to Marketing course, he covers the materials really well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor, super interesting, funny, fair, and interesting. Have to read the book and take a quiz based on the reading every week. Two easy papers, midterm and final. Not Hard just have to review a bit. Also participate once in a while and you will be fine, he takeds attendence so come to class easy way to keep points. Highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: MRKT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely exhausting tests and decent amount of work, you have to go to class, but they aren't boring, i personally didn't care for his attitude/mood swings. overall i wouldn't recommend but you could do alot worse</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice and very fair teacher.

Not boring whatsoever, quizzes once/week. ask for extra credit. does not curve. 2 papers, final midterm, quizzes and participation are how he gets your grade. Kinda psycho and cocky but enjoyable class. Got an A-. but I worked for it. Not easy but fair.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome instructor, good people skills, very personable, down-to-earth, and knows his stuff, not called &quot;Dr.&quot; Kemp for nothing. MORE than fair with tests and grading. Look, if you can't get an A from this teacher, then leave school, cause there's no hope for you. Dr. Kemp is a very sharp guy, and cool too...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good professor, you will learn a lot about marketing and he really opens up you interest in the subject.

Definitely knowledgeable in his field, but don't challenge his thoughts if you want a good participation grade.  He grades fairly easy (class avg. was an &quot;A-&quot;).

Right answers on the quizzes differ from those in the book.  Only He know's how much he gives for particpation!  He screamed @ students!  Don't question your grade; he see's this as a challenge!
