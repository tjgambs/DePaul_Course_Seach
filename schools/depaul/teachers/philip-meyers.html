Loves Sports and is more than willing to help anyone on their papers. Will always have two group sessions on assigned papers. Goes over rubric and has discussions on what is best to answer. You Will So Much Fun in Summer Sports. So Cool. Great Field Trips.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2012<br>Class Name: PSC369<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely interesting class with a prof who really cares about his students learning.  Is willing to meet out of class to help students understand the material & presents it in a very understanding & interesting way.  Final project is handed out the first day & while it should take you some time to finish it, it's way better than writing some essay</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Meyers is very knowledgeable in the field of sports in general and he will clarify the topic if you do not understand it. I look forward to taking another class of his.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Really captures the classroom, if you are interested. If you're not then no point in taking the class. Everything was really hands on. Discussions flowed and seemed like everyone participated. Spent a week in this class from 8am-6pm and loved every second of it. If you like sports you will like this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2011<br>Class Name: PSC369<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and goes out of his way for his students to succeed. Don't BS with him 'cause he sees right through it-as some girls realized in class early. The project is tough so start early but he will help out if any problems arise. I would recommend him but take the class seriously, participate, and don't be afraid to ask questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2011<br>Class Name: PSC369<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tremendous professor who is dedicated and there to help every student! Challenging, interesting, and funny! Knows his sports!! Also, did research before taking this class to see ones taught--which are 110 and 369. Negative reviews weren't even his classes! Defiately take this teacher--expects a lot, but hard work pays off!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2011<br>Class Name: PSC369<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a wonderful Professor. I enjoyed his class tremendously. He is extremely helpful, energetic and funny.  I absolutely recommend taking a class from Prof Phil.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2011<br>Class Name: PSC369<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Phil is passionate about his classes, which makes them much more entertaining.  He breaks from class structure norms</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: PSC369<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Everyone says he is tough but isn't every 300 level poli sci professor&#63; He actually cares about his students deeply. He is there for you whenever you need him and is willing to help. If you actually try, professor Meyers gives you every opportunity to do well. I strongly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2011<br>Class Name: PSC369<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Meyers is misunderstood. Solid professor. Not only are his topics interesting; so is he. They say that you can't tell a lot about a first impression but with Prof Phillip, you can! He is charasmatic and awesome. One of DePaul's finest.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do you like writing 8 page papers in 11 point font&#63; Then this is the professor for you. I understand challenging students, but this is an intro to DePaul, Chicago Quarter class. You also  barely go on any outings and you spend most of immersion week watching movies in the classroom. Not recommended- especially for Discover Chicago.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2011<br>Class Name: PSC369<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>People complain because they want to be GIVEN an A. It is a 300 level course, so it requires effort! All of the work was relevant and Meyers is more than willing to help. He should be taken if you want an enjoyable class to engage in, not one which you expect an A. That said, effort will pay off and it is not difficult to do well. RECOMMENDED!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: PSC369<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Project is a lot of work but it is also extremely informative.  Prof. Meyers makes himself available to all students after every class/for outside appointments/via e-mail.  The people who did poorly generally did not take advantage of this opportunity.  The topic was interesting and the class was very good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He requires that you participate in class - simple as that.  Others have mentioned &quot;picking favorites,&quot; but obviously he will reward those who do not sleep through discussions and who seem interested in topics.</div></div></div></body></html>
