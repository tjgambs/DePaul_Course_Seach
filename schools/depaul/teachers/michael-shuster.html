Super nice guy, understanding, and willing to work with you so you understand a dry and difficult subject. I dreaded taking research methods and he made it totally bearable. He is funny and endearing, not to mention very cute which sure doesn't hurt. Take him for everything you can!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2014<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Coolest professor on the face of the planet. I would take him for every class if I could.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>As someone who sucks at Research Methods this class was always a struggle, however Shuster offered enough curves and extra credit to where I pulled off an A-. There was a lot of work involved (something was due practically each class) however Shuster could then make the last test well before finals which was great. He's also really helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great teacher with a great sense of humor, TAKE HIM. especially for RM, which is difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2012<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was overall relatively easy if you put in the effort and do the extra credit. He doesn't ask for very much and is always willing to meet outside of class to clarify things. He is a very good looking man and at times it was a bit distracting. But aside from that, its a good class. I recommend taking it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2012<br>Class Name: PSY303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes class more than easy to get an A. People who complain about him are obviously lazy and unwilling to put in any effort. I've had him for research methods as well, yes this is an important class, meaning you should have to do some out of class reading in order to fully understand concepts. Professors only facilitate learning, this is college...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2012<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's nice, yes. But he is very unclear and you have to take his quizzes before you even learn about the subject, which makes no sense! Yes research is boring but you need to be able to understand it and he did not make sense because he doesn't know what he's talking about. Nice guy, but needs A LOT of work in his teaching skills. A LOT.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2011<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Research methods is not the most interesting material, but he did his best. He is extremely helpful/clear, and leaves lots of helpful comments on HW.  Grading is fair yet not too hard. He uploaded all of the grades online in a timely manner; he was the ONLY teacher I had this quarter that did, and I really appreciated that! What's not to like&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall enjoyable class, Mr. Shuster is entertaining. Its research methods so it is going to be a little dry by nature. Not an overwhelming amount of work, just what can be expected from research methods: tests, papers, labs.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
