He is an expert and knows his stuff inside and out. Prior to teaching @ DePaul he was a principle & super intendant. His lectures are extremely clear and heartfelt. Sweetest professor I've ever had. He makes it easy to succeed and learn. Take his class if you're an ed major- you'll learn so much and won't regret it</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2014<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I graduated already but figured I would rate Tavano since his class and his insight has proved to be the most useful. He definitely seems to favor students, but it's pretty easy to get on his good side. Talk to him, ask questions, clarify and he will love you. He knows his stuff and I have definitely used his methods more than any other DP prof. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: EE326<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Tavano is a teacher who I found to be very condescending. He was not very forgiving of mistakes and chose favorites. If you want to be a suck up, take his class. I will be avoiding his classes from now on.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best professors at DePaul.

My favorite so far. He is so passionate about teaching, and it really shows in the class. He is a very sweet man, and if you take good notes, then you will do awesome. Attendance is mandatory.

He really cares about how you're doing and will do anything he can to help you.  However, don't miss class and make sure to hand everything in.  He is a stickler for being on time.  If you show effort and participate you'll have no problem in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2011<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>stay AWAY!

He will find anyway to lower your grade significantly. If you receive one low score you should expect him to lower your overall grade by at least one letter grade!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2010<br>Class Name: EE326<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dr frank Tavano was my elementary school principal he was always a great guy and if i didnt go to school he would pick me up and bring me there he was a great principal so im sure he is a great teacher!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: EE326<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very nice if you are his favorites, but if you are not, he will make the class unbearable for you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2010<br>Class Name: EE326<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes ok as a professor. The thing that really bothered me is his apperance of being this wonderful and nice guy but he really is strict and makes his opinion known. I liked Tavano but the class was sometimes tedious and had us doing things we arent actually gonna use. And on the final note he will tell the same story 15 times.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2010<br>Class Name: EDU315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>People entering the field of education today will face a variety of children in their classroom, he does not take in account the variety of students you will encounter. I gave a speech on inclusion about my autistic brother  and he told me in front of a class to my face he does not agree with this. That is against Il state laws. And unethical.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2010<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him! You will love him! He is so enthusiastic about what he teaches. He is always willing to help and check over assignments before turning them in. Attendance is important in his class. Quizzes are not hard. You will not regret taking his class!I sure didn't.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2010<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Tavano was one of the most knowledgeable teachers at DePaul. He is so nice and goes out of his way to help. Although, sometimes he misplaces papers, assignments etc. and will fight to the death that he handed it back even though he didn't. But I wish every teacher at DePaul was that enthused and so passionate about what he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2010<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so awesome! He is the sweetest person ever. If you need any help at all he is more than willing to assist you. The class is easy so shouldn't be a prob getting an A. Just make sure you are on time, dont be absent, and do all the work. If you are sick and you talk to him about it he'll excuse you. I LOVE HIM! CANT WAIT TO TAKE HIS OTHER CLASS</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2009<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tavano is definitely a professor that cares about your success.

Assignments are crystal clear. He teaches for mastery and grades accordingly, so as long as you put in your best effort it's hard not to do really well. He truly wants every one of his students to succeed both in his class and in life.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2007<br>Class Name: EE326<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE TAVANO!

Although I agree with the test/government comments that were left about him (in other words, I don't agree with his opinions!), he, along with the way the class is run, is so care-free that I just ignored those points. Def. try to take him if you can :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2007<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best of the best.

He says nothing about it in attendance policy, but will drop your grade multiple letters for it. Grade is based much more on attendance and tardies than effort towards work or class participation.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2005<br>Class Name: EE326<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Correction, Frank thinks that something like standardized tests can help to gage a school's improvement and if teachers get detailed scores back they can use them to see each child's weak points.  He answers any questions you may have and his only requirement is that you attend class. THAT would be the only reason one could ever receive a poor grad</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2005<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy is a pompous and thinks he knows it all. Yeah , he is freindly and all but he is very condencending and if you disagree with his OPINOINs then your wrong. He is very bias, and believes this goverment is helping the educational system with standard tests, instead of allowing teachers to critically teach and educate children.VERY OVERRATED</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2005<br>Class Name: EDU<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't say enough amazing things about this man!
