She challenges students to critically think and use statistical data to back up their arguments. Dr. Johnson will "tell you how it is" and some students do not appreciate the beauty in that privilege. Love her! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2015<br>Class Name: PSC218<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>The frustrating thing about Valerie Johnson is that she proudly wears her passion on her sleeve, yet breaks down when you dare challenge some of her beliefs. The place of a professor isn't to use class as a forum to prove that their opinions are 'right', but rather to open up constructive dialogue. She will shoot you down rudely if you disagree. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is not worth taking. For a sophomore seminar class you can choose so many more easier classes. You literally got to read every single text to pass. To top it all of, shes the chairman of the department so there's no one that can say anything to her.  Expects way too much from you and is very picky about everything. Do not take her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2014<br>Class Name: PSC282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's amazing.  Keep up with the readings cause they are essential.  Super interesting to listen to her opinions.  She always has great discussions going and encourages participation.  Just follow her guidelines for assignments and there is no reason you should't get an A.  She's intelligent and makes it very clear what she expects from you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2013<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>I know most of my peers didn't like her, and I can understand why.

She is ALWAYS willing to help her students.  Reading is essential in this class.  Some are long, others are short, but for the most part the readings are bearable and easy to understand.  The subject material is interesting.  I loved her class, and highly recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2011<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this lady and was very helpful. the 120 class was very interesting and if you talk in class she will love you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: PSC223<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Hard grader, blabs on about the same thing the whole time.

Take home final but ridiculous amount of work and citing from the readings. AVOID AVOID AVOID. You could take easier classes to fulfill this credit.

Syllabus said class would be discussion based but she lectured the whole time. Super liberal Huge advocate for affirmative action and talks about Jesse Jackson all the time. WAY TOO MUCH work for a requried class (12 page research paper, 4 other papers, and final essay exam) Very strict and not a reasonable person. waste of time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: PSC223<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please do not take this class or you will regret it.  Unfortunately I cannot swear on here otherwise she would be called every name in the book. It may sound like I am just disgruntled but do not say I did not warn you. Went to her numerous times for help, she was not helpful or even willing to help much.  Even if a professor is bad most will help.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Johnson displays genuine interest in her subject and hearingthe opinions of her students. 3 Video reviews, some quizzes on the readings, 7-9 pg research paper, and a take home final.

Great resource if you're interested in these topics. As was said before, 1 research paper, one test (take home final), and you can get away with little reading. And you can turn in paper drafts early, she edits and lets you rewrite.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall an easy class. 3 movie reviews, 1 research paper and 1 test. The final was hard, mainly because we barely discussed the textbook in class up until the last sessions. Talks a lot about current politics and class tended to revolve around those debates. Very strict with grading and attendance but you can get away with minimal reading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: PSC223<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting prof.

Yes, she's liberal and will debate you on issues but she can at least hold her own. I only wished more people would say something in the class. Witty, hilarious, I'll try and take another class just because she can actually engage you in the topic.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2006<br>Class Name: PSC218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really focused, intense, and devoted teacher. Really knowledgable of the subject matter, and able to respond to the most **** and closed-minded dribble students' without losing her cool; quite amazing given the amount of outright **** opinions forwarded by students in the class. This is an eye-opening course and professor. Take Her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2006<br>Class Name: PSC228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for my junior learning course psc and enjoyed the course.

She talked about her PHd at least 2 times during each class, which is a mystery as to how she got it. she didn't really teach much about what we were supposed to learn, just the rainbow/Push coalition because she worked there for a little... oh and how great jesse jackson is</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2006<br>Class Name: PSC328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the greatest teachers ever!  Seriously if you don't like this woman you are probably just in disagreement with her beliefs.  Her classes are awesome and she welcomes anyone's opinions.  Urban education was one of the best classes I have taken at this school.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: PSC328<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a self-proclaimed &quot;affirmative action baby and proud of it.&quot; Her class could have been great, but she just rants about whatever she wants, barely citing our reading or outside facts. She also misuses words constantly, like to throw around lots of political cliches, and is heavilty biased to the left. Only take if you can roll w/ the BS punch</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very passionate, but she gets too caught up in the issues that are close to her area of expertise and doesn't give a very broad perspective on government until late in the course. It's not too hard, but you do have to keep up with the reading because there are constant quizzes on the reading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very passionately liberal, a little bit pessimistic about politics. Too much student presentation. Easy grader. She opened &quot;Some say: America- love it or leave it. I say: America- love it or fix it.&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher. Go to class and do the assigned readings and you will do great in class.  Make sure you participate!  The class was very interesting and gave you a new way of looking at the government.  Def. take this teacher.  She is helpful and intelligent.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst teacher I have had in my life. She relied completely on student presentations to discuss the readings, which were assigned in an unorganized manner. For the things she actually did say, they were corrupted with her worthless opinion. Complete waste of tuition money. I dont understand why she is rated so well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: PSC218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very thought provoking class, most of it was discussion and peer presentations of readings. Try to take notes of the reading presentations and def. take notes when she speaks. Not a hard grader if you put some effort into the assgn. Be prepared to have an opinion!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: PSC282<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Valerie Johnson is clear and concise and details exactly what is expected in her class. The mandatory community service associated with this class is time consuming but can be rewarding. She is fair and not too difficult. I strongly recommend taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: URBANPOLITICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Prof. Johnson course. She was interesting and her corny jokes keep that class going. I have graduated from DePaul since I had her and she is still one of the BEST professors I had. Her assignments are fair, and her grading is fair. If you think you can get away with not doing the reading and the assignments this class is not for you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2005<br>Class Name: PSC282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher who really knows about what she teaches like the back of her hand. Overall I had no trouble getting a A with not that much work involved. No complaints about everything. I suggest you take her if you are interested in political science and/or black political action. You will learn a lot without even knowing it. Great.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2005<br>Class Name: PSC218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent lecturer with a phenominal grasp of the subject matter.

Her class was fascinating and she directed very interesting discussions.  There is no merit to the previous comment that you must be black to succeed in or enjoy her classes.  She is also very open during office hours, you can go to her with any questions academic or personal.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2005<br>Class Name: AFRICANPOLITIC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite professor.
