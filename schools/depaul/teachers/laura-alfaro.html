She always expects you to do homework and attend class. If she teaches any other classes I'll be the first student to enroll.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2015<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend this professor for an intro class. She's very clear in explaining everything and has office hours every week. This definitely isn't an easy A but you'll learn a lot. Homework assignment is due once a week and there is an extra credit opportunity. Textbook are only really necessary to study for midterm and final. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2015<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>She makes the fundamentals of web design entertaining and exciting. Quickly responds to inquiries and gives great feedback. She really cares about her students and knows how to make class fun. Gives you extra credit for completing all the assignments, like damn who else is that cool? Would highly recommend her as your introduction to IT. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2014<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Laurie is a really great person. You work in a computer lab for this course and she shows you step -by-step how to do everything that you will be assigned. Very accessible via email for quick questions. Has office hour sign up sheets during class, but haven't used it. Graded on 7 assignments (w 1 free pass), a midterm, a final project, and a final</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2014<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Laurie is thebomb.com. Very nice, loves what she does and willing to help in/out of class and mildly arousing as well for some reason. Tests are very easy and straight forward if you do the reading. Her assignments are graded on the harder side but it's very fair. If you have 90% of the code correct you won't get a 90 because the site will look bad</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2014<br>Class Name: ISM210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a great professor. Not difficult at all but requires you to work. Readings are a must because of discussions. Midterm and a final, both were allowed an index card. Learned a lot and would recommend to anyone that is required to take this class. I received an A.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
