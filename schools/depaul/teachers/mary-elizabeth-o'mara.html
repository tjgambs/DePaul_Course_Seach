Her class is always fair, and she's hilarious.  She grades really well, her midterm and final are really easy is you just pay attention in class.  She even lets you use index cards to help on the final.  Take this class! Really interesting, and I didn't want to take it at first. glad i did!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2008<br>Class Name: HST262<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ok</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2008<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She barely ever taught class then had a hard final and midterm.

Also, she is more than willing to take the time and help you understand the material. I highly reccomend this class. It gives you a broad understanding of religions in the U.S..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2007<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class feels like a 300 level one. There's so much reading, only ONE (comprehensive) exam, worship visit paper, event paper, bio profile, individual presentation, in class group work, 2 debats, AND, let's not foreget, participation. Interesting class, but too much work. I don't recommend it.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
