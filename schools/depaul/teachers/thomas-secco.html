Best teacher in the world! He actually cares. Yes, he is kind of easy grading-wise but thats because he doesn't want anyone to fail. You learn as much as you put into the class. Class consist of maybe 3-4 papers. Hes really crazy about the &quot;outline, rough draft, final draft&quot; thing and recommends that you hand write stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/18/2007<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Secco is a great teacher. I had him a couple of years ago, and he helped improve my writing 100%.  It is obvious that the people who wrote the comments below were too caught up with their grades to take his advice, you can tell by their grammatical errors. Learn to write well before you criticize a professor, especially an Eng.

Brilliant man.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>IF you really want to improve on your writing, don't take his class. If your the kind of student that wants an easy A, then he's definately for you. a minimal amount of work, and almost no focus on english, he runs his class more like a current events class than anything else. If you really want to learn something, take someone else!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a smart person. he is generous and tries to make his students think critically. he cares abuot students learning. take him and be prepared to work.he is not easy for someone who is vain and egotistical. i learned.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite teacher that I have had at DePaul!!
