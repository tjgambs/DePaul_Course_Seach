Even if you don't do the readings, everything on the tests are materials covered in class. Group assignments can get a little long and frustrating but other than that, this class is not difficult if you actually put in time and effort.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: HLTH202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a sweet lady but a horrible professor. This has been the most boring class of my entire life! Do not take her especially if it's a 6-9:15pm class. Her exams are really difficult. Mainly because she doesn't give you a study guide and there's a lot of material. Her "review" is a joke. Long, tedious assignments due at the end of every class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: HLTH202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>As far as hotness goes, i'm not a picky guy. She's cute. I wouldn't say she's easy, but she's fair. Do the readings, and know some basic algebra. She isn't confusing, but the material is! Read the book, it's short. I started off the quarter thinking she was gonna be difficult, but I got the hang of the class by not being lazy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2014<br>Class Name: HLTH202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolute worst teacher I have ever had. EVER. Does not care about students. Long and brutally boring lectures. Is not helpful. No study guides, no help from teacher. Only way I passed her test was literally reading the whole text book on my own. Would give ridiculously long, difficult and tedious work in a short period of time. AVOID AT ALL COST!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2014<br>Class Name: HLTH202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes the absolute worst! Every single student is bored and confused. The look of shame in every student's eyes after a test lets you know that a professor is not doing their job. I can't believe this is the education we pay for at Depaul University. Mandtory attendance, no study guides, just worthless death by power points.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
