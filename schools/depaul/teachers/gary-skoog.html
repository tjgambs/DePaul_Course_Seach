Didn't grasp the concept that most people in business school students aren't interested in solving proofs.  Nice guys, exams are HARD but curves are massive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2009<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While Professor Skoog was a smart man he had a very hard time being able to make the material understandable to his students.  He read directly from the textbook slides that has many typos.  Also, his test did not coordinate with the class notes or the textbook.  However, he did give a pretty substantial curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attending class is painful and a waste of time. Professor read directly from the textbook provided slides. Half of the class would leave at the first break. Prof. Keeps students the entire period. Is not available for outside class help. Must talk to him through blackboard. Half the class failed his exams... but he does curve</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2009<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While he may be a nice person his teaching style of lecturing from the ppt provided by the text book is boring and awful.   The questions for the exam are not clear and moreover are always completely foreign to what he discusses in lecture.  He in no way teaches how to practice the knowledge he lectures about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2009<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While he may be a nice person his teaching style of lecturing from the ppt provided by the text book is boring and awful.

Take another econ professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best prof. I've ever taken. Take him if you want knowledge and good grade.

Material in class is nothing like the exam.  Curve is very minimal, only 4 A's given in my class.  Frequently forgets what he is talking about while lecturing and has to pause for minutes.</div></div></div></body></html>
