This class is easy. Midterm, final, and quizes are easy. I got an &quot;A&quot; with just my notes (didn't even bother buying the book). Take the class and enjoy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I missed 6 classes and still got an A. If your not a slacker and ask questions he's an amazing teacher and very helpful. Granted its Philosophy and the concepts are hard to understand but if you make an effort it pays off. But you actually need to make an effort.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you come to this class up until he stops taking attendance and take COPIUS notes then there's no reason why you won't get an A.  I got an A so it's possible people.  He's also cute in a &quot;different&quot; way. :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His attitude was unforgivable.  Assumed we did not want to be there and acted like he did not want to be there. If he wanted class to be interesting he could have attempted to be positive and caring.  Too concerned with his students on a social level.  This is all too bad because he had great teaching skills.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's alright. He doesn't want to be there, but neither did I (so it worked). Easy class, easy grader. I didn't read the material for the midterm and got a 98. just pay attention (somewhat) and laugh at his jokes (which aren't to bad).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Remember folks: he's a grad student! And he acts like he doesn't really want to be here.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't understand why people like him. He's basically an **** who thinks he is better than anyone who would take PHL100... If you know philosophy already, don't take him. If you want to learn interesting parts of philosophy, don't take him. PS- Despite what he acknowledges, he's a GRAD student!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Impossible grader.  Never clear on what he wants.  And ladies, if you are expecting a &quot;tamale&quot; worthy professor, you will be utterly disappointed.  He tries to act cool more than getting the points across.  Biggest waste of my time ever, and bye the end, I could not stand to hear him speak anymore</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: PHLONEHUNDRED<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool, fun, smart, sarcastic, hard, easy, confusing, nice, boring, ****..... he's hard to figure out but he is a very good professor. I can honestly say I both learned and enjoyed the readings. Holds the chalk like a cigarette and drinks out of a to-go mug - feels like a coffee shop.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's cool but a hard grader. i can only say i got a b- in that class, which i personally thought was impossible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>yea he totally grades hard...his final is hella hard so pay attention in the last week..bc i didnt and i'm totally struggling with the final paper..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this class at first but then we got back the first paper... he's a very interesting guy and completely hilarious at times but he is a very hard grader.  If you have an intrest in philosophy definitly take him.  If not i'd avoid the class because a A isnt really possible</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2004<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard grader.  Course load is not too bad.  If you are not 100% clear about the theories and the reading then the discussions will be very uninteresting and difficult.  He tend to talk in circles, but overall it was an alright class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved his class. The lazy, uninterested, and unengaged students in this first year philosophy class are what make the discussions drag, no fault of his own. Of the 4 college philosophy classes I've taken, I found his to be the most interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really looked forward to this class. The readings are hard, but he explains them really well. Plus he's fun to look at!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a very good and fun teacher to have, although at times it was tough to get through his class due to slow discussions. New teacher that has to deal with hard to clarify so i give him some credit.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2004<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He dresses really cute</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2003<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He taught the subject well and made difficult concepts very clear! I enjoyed him as a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2003<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a cool teacher and people would get more out of the class if they did the readings and participated.  He's also super cute.  How old is he&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2003<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Garrett is a nice guy. It seems as though many people in the class just don't give him a chance. The say he's boring, but that's because nobody participates. Students think he is not clear enough but then again, he is teaching first year philosophy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2003<br>Class Name: PHY100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although Professor Ryan continually says the same things over and over again, he never makes his explanations very clear. He grades reflections pretty easily but on quizes he looks for things he doesn't ask for and grades you down if they aren't there.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2003<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Besides saying the same garbage over and over again, Ryan can't seem to motivate the class to participate or even grasp understanding- leaving the people who do want sucess with the same bad grades as everyone else.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
