I wanted to take this class to prepare for CFA.  He did nothing to help me achieve this.  Rather, he spoke about the economy for the first half of class then read slides that came with the book.  He provided no teaching value at all whatsoever about analyzing financial stmts.  I learned absolutely NOTHIN</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2009<br>Class Name: FIN315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor really helped me understand the subject material in a way that was applicable to the real world.  His grading is fair, but tough.  In response to the previous rating, I too had a bad group for my project.  I just informed the prof. and he took that into consideration for my grade; which actually was a good one.  Take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor relies entirely on PowerPoint slides, which he reads to the class.  We used a convoluted Excel spreadsheet to value stocks, but the prof. never showed us how to use it.  I had an A in this class until a final group project where other members dropped the ball.  Ended up with a B+ and no room for negotiation with the prof.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
