If you want to skate through school like most of the other people at this school, he will fail you and wont apologize for it, nor should he.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST PROF EVER!!!

He doesn't talk about anything remotely related to the subject we should be covering in class, there is no structure to his expectations, he doesn't engage the class while lecturing.Im only in my 3 rd week of class with this guy...IM SCARED!! BEWARE!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2004<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very smart guy. And he's pretty hard. However, if you are willing to take good notes...i mean good, and study, you will be okay. He lectures the whole time and students are writting the whole time. So, be prepared,it won't be an easy/blow off class</div></div></div></body></html>
