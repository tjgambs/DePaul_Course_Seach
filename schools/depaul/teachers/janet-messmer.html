That doesn't mean she isn't condescending and terrifying but she really does care about all of her students, both academically and personally. I always got good grades when I thought I did poorly and bad grades when I thought I did well but whatever, she really knows her stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2005<br>Class Name: SURVEY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I fought to stay awake during this class.  It's in the dark watching slides everyday.

She was very generous and cared about the progress of her students- she even retaught a class with only me in it to make sure I understood the info.  Some of these responses have been immature.  She's an excellent teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: COSTUMING<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All I'll say is that the biggest part of her body is the chip on her shoulder.
