To the point where it is a bit overwhelming since he gives individual homework on top of the group work he gives you. He can sometimes come off as a bit impatient when he doesn't understand a student's question but overall he is not a mean guy at all and does try to answer questions as best he can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>He was a good teacher for this class and was easy because this class is before WRD 103104. He was very helpful and got to know his students.   It was a good class and a lot of stuff to do.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2014<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: P</div><div id="right"><div>This is my first time ever rating a professor on here so believe me when I say this: Do not take WRD 204 with Howard Clauser. The amount of work he assigns is RIDICULOUS compared to the other Technical Writing classes. He's also a very hard grader. Technical writing is an important class, ur better off taking it w/someone you'll actually learn from</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2014<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: P</div><div id="right"><div>This is my first time ever rating a professor on here so believe me when I say that Professor Clauser is, without a doubt, THE ABSOLUTE WORST teacher I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. The amount of work he assigns is RIDICULOUS compared to the other Technical Writing classes. He is also a very hard grader. REFRAIN from WRD 204 w/Clauser</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2014<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>He may be good on campus, but save yourself and avoid his online course. Too much emphasis on group work for online and he is a hard grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2014<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Professor Clauser's class during the 2011-2012 Spring Quarter at DePaul. I was so intimidated by the amount of work we needed to do which was ultimately the manual. Not only was the class great but many of the skills I learned, I still use because of what he taught. I hope he's still teaching because he's a great guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2012<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor. Class demands a certain amount of attention but the assignments aren't complicated. Pretty easy to get a good grade in the class as long as you stay on top of the assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2012<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was dreading having to take another WRD class, but I did not mind this class. Prof. Clauser is very clear in what he wants. Class consists of 5 documents which you get an initial grade, a final portfolio with your revised documents, and a final exam. The class is mandatory attendance, but overall an easy class! Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2012<br>Class Name: AA104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great teacher.  Explains thoroughly, and is a engaging speaker.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher, he gets pretty gung-ho about stuff and the class can be pretty interesting at times. Mostly pretty straight forward-just do your work. He's easy to talk to but don't skip class. He doesn't keep tabs on you, you've got to be on your a-game. Cheers.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
