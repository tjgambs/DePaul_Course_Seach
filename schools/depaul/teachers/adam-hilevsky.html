Buy a flash drive, you'll need it. He's a good professor and very intelligent, but the class and material provided to him was just a drag.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2013<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, very easy class but lazy: he doesn't grade anything or gives the same quizzes. I wish I could have learned more though!If you're looking for an easy A, this is the class for you. If you really want learn the language, don't take his class then.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2012<br>Class Name: FCH203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of speaking in class and written assignments. No quizzes. He doesn't grade things so it's hard to say where you stand grade-wise but if you do everything and kind of participate, you should get an A. Pretty sassy and fun. PS. Don't be fooled by the chili pepper, he is not hot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2011<br>Class Name: FCH202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, and you do learn, i just feel like he needs to crack down a bit more on homework and grammar, etc.  I feel like I could have learned a lot more.  But he is a nice guy, and really funny too.  Fun class :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2010<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sassy. 2 thumbs up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2010<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome! great sense of humor and makes learning French easy and fun (as long as you pay attention and aren't an idiot) He's fluent in like 6,000 languages, so try not to be intimidated by how much smarter he is than you. Also, he's big on teaching language as it's actually spoken, which is helpful. If you don't feel like doing the homework, he collects it at tests -- but he knows who studies and who doesn't. don't take him for an easy A, but if you come to class and follow along, pretty easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2010<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Adam. He was cute and had an adorable accent (Polish I think). He really knows the language and wants you to do well in his class. He grades fairly easily and his tests weren't bad at all. The class structure got kind of boring and repetitive, but it was good for a 101 class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2009<br>Class Name: FCH202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice and an easy grader...class was easy overall but i did not learn anything new.

There are 4 tests every few weeks, but they are pretty easy. There is 1 small partner project, but can easily be done. The final is a discussion with him. There are no papers. Take this class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2007<br>Class Name: POL105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED HIM!!!!

Honestly one of the best professors i've had.  i had him for 103 and 104, and you don't know what you're missing until he's gone!!  i can't wait to take him for 106 again!  highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2006<br>Class Name: FCH104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for 103 as well, and he is an excellent teacher!!  someone intimidating at first, he is a great blend of wanting you to know the language with having fun and joking around.  What an amazing guy, I think his teaching style is very straight forward and easy to follow.  Definitely recommend him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: FCH106202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He expects a lot out of you, but great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2006<br>Class Name: POL112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers i have had a depaul. He wants his students to be successful and trys his best to help anyone you is in need of help. I have taken his twice already and going to take him again. I recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2006<br>Class Name: FCH1023<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, at times it was difficult to follow the class &quot;discussions&quot; but thats because I suck at French.  He is pretty easy as far as grading because he will almost spell out each test for you before the exam.  I put in very little effort and did very well, and walked out knowing some pretty basic conversational French.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: FCH102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As far as intro french goes, he's pretty good.  lots of tests / quizzes but thats the program, not him.  he basically tells you EXACTLY what is on each exam, so with minimal studying you can do well.  I put very little effort in and got an A... he is also very willing to help if you have any questions.  recomended but take madame brault if you can</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2006<br>Class Name: FCH102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: FRENCH201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His a nice teacher but he gives too many tests/ exams.

Study and be serious. If you respect him he'll respect you. Great sense of humor and very helpful and sympathetic.

I think this may be due to the terrible textbook we have. ($200 down the drain if you ask me.) As a prof. he's great but assigns a lot of extra stuff. You'll work HARD for an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2004<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2004<br>Class Name: FRENCH1<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2004<br>Class Name: FCH203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hilvesky rocks my world.
