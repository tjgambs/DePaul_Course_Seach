I knew absolutely nothing about art, but she was willing to take time to explain things properly and is willing to help all students, no matter what their level is.  She also is concerned about progress and accomplishing the assignment rather than conventional quality. She's the Best!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: ART292<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Annie is the bomb...she is a balanced personality.

She lets students dictate a lot of class. Easy projects and Annie makes it enjoyable. This was a non-major class, so if you enjoy art but aren't too serious about it, take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Heckman is awesome! You won't regret taking a course with her.  She is extremely helpful and kind and the work is manageable.  She even offers to get the class food on critique days.  Two thumbs up!
