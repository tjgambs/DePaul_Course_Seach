It's really a tough class. But she's making the class so helpful. She's very nice and fun. This class convinced me that I might want to do thesis rather than comps. Very helpful</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2009<br>Class Name: PR255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most creative professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2009<br>Class Name: PRA530<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an academic focused professor.  You'll be doing a Ton of reading covering a lot of theoretical materials.  Avoid if possible for graduate programs or if you want real world knowledge.  She made students lead group discussions where if you didn't get others to talk, you lost points.  Raising hand offering comments is a must to pass this class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2009<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am having her for my intro PR class. She's really funny and teaches well. She always gave us examples that are really fun and helpful to grasp concepts.

She seriously grades you on how often you raise your hand and if you don't, no matter how good all your REAL work was, that will greatly impact your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: PRAD376<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take her unless you have too. I was really excited for the class in the beginning, after I wish I'd waited for another professor to teach it. She's goes off the powerpoints and you have to participate ridiciously to get the maximum points. On the bright side, if youre doing the night class u get out about 45 mins to an hour early</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2009<br>Class Name: PR255<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is Awful and barely speaks English. Her use of the English Language is Brutal. She thinks students are below her and treats them that way. Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a terrible teacher. She sprayed herself in the face with  pepperspray, and then told us about it.  Everybody failed her final and when we explained to her that the questions were not clear she didn't care. Don't take her.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
