Unreasonably difficult grader. Refuses to help students individually, must post questions on discussion board or you will get an angry email reply telling you to post your question. 23 quizzes, 3 2-page papers, 10 weekly discussions posts needing 2 comments on others' posts, midterm AND final. Won't go over mc on exams, WHAT??</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2015<br>Class Name: RE350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Literally the worst online teacher ever. She is extremely strict, grades harshly, and the tests are extremely tough. Seeing as this class is offered to non-majors, she really isn't helpful to those whose main priority is not real estate. DO NOT TAKE HER! You will regret it. Also, the tests are online, but are monitored by your camera.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2015<br>Class Name: RE350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid. Weekly discussion posts, 4 long memo papers, 2 weekly quizzes from 10-20 q each, midterm and a whole quarter final! She doesn't teach at all. No way to get an A from this class! Opinionated, unclear, prejudice, lazy and rude teacher, never responded on any emails! Requires work when gives nothing from herself. Avoid her! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2015<br>Class Name: RE350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>What a horrible class structure. It was an online class that ended up being hard and more time consuming than any other class I have taken. Tests are ridiculously long and unreasonable. There is no communication due to a very lazy professor. How do you have group projects in an online class? And a cumulative final including 22 chapters? Come on DPU</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2015<br>Class Name: RE350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor should be fired from DePaul. She is lazy, not clear on her assignments, and makes the tests extremely hard. For her midterms and finals, she pretty much copy and pastes her powerpoints onto a document and says for you to study that. Worst professor ever.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
