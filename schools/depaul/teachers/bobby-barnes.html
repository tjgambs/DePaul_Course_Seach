I thought he was absolutely hilarious, but I don't know if my classmates felt the same. Gives you easy assignments about once a week. The Wall Street Journal is required for the class, which I actually found to be a plus.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2012<br>Class Name: ECON306<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher knows the material pretty well, but seems to have a hard time communicating it to all the students. Average tests scores were low for most exams. He gives three exams, the third counts as the final. Each exam was 50 m/c and 3-4 long response. The book is a must if you want to pass this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2012<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Average class. He went off topic several times but tries to make the class laugh. 7 homework assignments that took maybe 15 minutes. You have to subscribe to the Wall Street Journal in order to do the homework. 3 tests which were all multiple choice. Study the powerpoints. I never read the book and received a B+ with minimal effort.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2012<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Barnes was an ok professor. He is passionate about economics and can sometimes ramble on. If you read the chapters before going to class, you should do fine on the tests. The tests can be tricky but if you study you should do fine. 94 and above is an A but depending on the class average, he will curve the grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him in summer. Very easy class. 60 points for quizzes. 100 points for each tests and 40 points for attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor I had a pleasure to meet. Really funny guy; makes really boring and dry material crystal clear and really fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a delightful guy, very knowledgeable. His class is basically broken down into 3 major exams and extra credit for attending his class. He basically just rambles about the material. His material is dry, but he tries his best to make it interesting by connecting the material to real live situations. In the end, he is a great prof. to have.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very, very good teacher!! He turned econ class from boring lecture to interesting and fun class. Three tests, not hard if you read the book. He also assigns weekly reports that make you understand econ theory and apply it with what is currently happening. If you really wanna learn a lot, take his class. I definitely take him for other ECO classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice guy, very funny.  He has a tendency to go on wild tangents in just about every class.  He's a smart guy, but sometimes he has no clue what he's doing.  It's pretty easy to get an A, there's 3 tests, 300 points total and he gives you study guides that are similar to the test. Take this guy,CONAN O'BRIEN look-alike.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Barnes is an excellent teacher. There are 3 exams and they are very straightforward and he gives you practice exams. He doesn't expect too much participation.  He is really funny and passionate about what he teaches. I would definitely recommend him because you will learn a lot about econ.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Would recommend his class. Pay attention to his lectures and study the text to score an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Teacher.  Provides real world examples to the concepts.  Often acknowledges difficulty of material and encourages questions.  Keeps things light with humor and stories.  Mid term and Final are difficult but manageable.  Slams you with 2 hours of notes then let's you out early.  By the weekend you get what he was saying.  Highly recomend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barnes is a good guy.  Read the book, and pay attention to the lectures carefully.  He offers to assist students, but many, including myself, are afraid to ask him questions.  Every now and then he may go off on a wild tangent that will last about 25 minutes.  Cool guy tho.  I'd recommend him.  He knows Econ and made an 830am class enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2010<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is not that hard if you put the time into the class. Only 3 tests but otherwise no hw or anything. Funny and made class entertaining.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR ECON 106 he might be a good teacher for 300 level classes but had no idea how to teach a 100 level class of my 3 years here i never had such a HORRIBLE TEACHER his class consists of 3 tests all worth 1000 pts which are really really tricky the first test avg was a 70 second 55 and third idk b/c it was the final AVIOD</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2009<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a passion for teaching ECON.  Very entertaining lectures and some good interaction.  Teaches off a chalkboard, old school style for a young prof.  Deviates a lot from book, only tests what he covers in class so  attend.  I really enjoyed listening to him and would take him again.  Covers relatively few concepts but tests are hard (curves em)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2008<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class is uber hard. the first test was straight from the book but the rest is strictly from notes..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2008<br>Class Name: ECON506<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes econ entertaining!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2008<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's funny. Always make class interesting. I have no complaints.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2008<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Professor, one of the best at DePaul. Took the time to work problems on the board and actually teaches material rather than reading power point slides. Great experience.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2008<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is great!  He is so entertaining and really wants to make sure that you understand what he is teaching. He also wears somewhat of a uniform:  khakis, yellow button down, and navy blazer with a jansport backpack.  LOVE IT!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>looks exactly like conon o'brein i cant stop laughing during his classes</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>After the first 20 minutes of the class I just wanted to leave. His notes and lecture are just incomprehensible. He can't even spell! If you want to learn economics at DePaul University take Krautmann or McCarthy. Otherwise don't take this professor who's teaching methods should be reevaluated by DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2008<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Didn't learn a thing from him. Worst professor I ever had. Waste of time and money. Take someone else. Want Easy A, or to just have fun go for him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I definately recommend this professor.

He will have you laughing half the class.  He also makes the subject matter understandable.  I would highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
