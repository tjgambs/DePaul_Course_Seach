She gives relevant feedback and is a quick grader. I took it online, so maybe my experience was different, but if you're a decent writer (or can at least follow directions and deadlines), you'll have no problem getting an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is great when it comes to giving feedback but she does give out a lot of work during the summer. This was taken online so it should be somewhat easier. The final was not easy. I felt the directions was unclear or not specified. I would recommend her if you really want to improve your writing but if you can, take someone else please!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Friedman is a really great prof. She definately gives you a good feel for what the business is like. There's a lot of assignments but any PR writing class is going to have that. If you do your work on time and attend class reguarly you'll get an A. I'm not even an all A student but if you show her your interested in the subject, you'll do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD291<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, I don't understand why she got such bad reviews.  She's an excellent teacher.  It seems like a lot of work but she is so understanding and tries to break it down to be as easy as possible.  She introduces herself right away and shakes your hand, you can tell she cares about her students. Definitely take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was a lot of writing assignments, but they were short papers. However I loved her, If you just talk to her she is more than willing to help and give an extension on homework. She does grade a little difficult but I would recommend this course and teacher. She even brought us cookies on the last day! Definitely do not buy the book though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take her if you want to experience the taste of hell. She makes writing the most difficult task in the world. I will never write again after taking her class. Yes, it is true that she is very experience with this field but she is too hard to please! Also, please don't buy the book! It's a total waste of money.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not buy the book, I feel it is pretty much a waste. Her class wasn't bad. Her lectures were dry but she does go through the assignments and provide lots of samples. Very experienced in her field. Always willing to help her students outside of class. Tough grader but she isn't a bad teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pros: She's experienced in her field, always willing to answer your questions, and pretty lenient if you're behind on homework. Cons: She does a poor job of explaining her assignments, there are a lot of them, and by the end of the class no one took it seriously. When planning your schedule, know that Judy is a time commitment.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
