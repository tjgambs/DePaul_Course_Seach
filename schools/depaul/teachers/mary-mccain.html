Be a good college student, that's what she expects. However, she is sensitive and aware that things happen. If you have a problem SEE HER she is super approachable. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2014<br>Class Name: DISCIRISHCATH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>Took her Discover Irish Catholics class in fall 2013. I thought Prof McCain did a really good job at making sure everyone was learning and giving imput, she was honest with her feedback and was very motherly. She was harsh sometime, but it was only with her rules, so it was justified. She emmits a total "mom" personality.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2014<br>Class Name: LST201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>I took her for Discover Irish Catholics. I had no interest in the topic even by the end. She's a very traditional professor, knows a lot about Irish history and really will take time to ask how you are and learn your name. However, if you are disrespectful or don't do your work, she will not be too kind.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very pleasant and knowledgeable. Tons of reading to do, some interesting, some not. Classes were lectures with discussions based on readings, and she does point out the important details. Incredibly hard grader for papers and tests, focuses on conventions and making sure you didn't miss a single point. Very little feedback given for graded papers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2013<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's INSANE about attendance. classes are all lecture, no pp or anything & participation required (she asks questions about the readings). course is pretty much all history/current events with minimal discussion of religion. hard-ish midterm, final paper, take home exam. learned a lot about irish history but not sure how much i liked her as a prof</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2012<br>Class Name: HST266<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Way too much reading. Attendance and participation are really important. Gives back papers with no feedback. Not recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2012<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intro to Catholicism. Hard/long tests and papers. 2 short papers, mid term & final exam, and 8 paged final paper. Boring lectures, hard grader, lots of reading, offers lots of extra credit. Not an easy A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2011<br>Class Name: HST268<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an extremely nice woman who really knows her stuff. She doesn't use powerpoints, but personally I think that her lectures are just as good for taking notes. Her papers and tests are difficult, but she is a very good professor and it is possible to get an A. Don't take her if you want an easy A. Take her if you really want to learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her intro to Catholicism class last quarter and I liked her so much that I am taking her History of Ireland class next quarter. I went into the class expecting to have a mean old lady shoving Catholicism down our throats and it ended up being my favorite class of the quarter because she was such a nice woman and I learned so much. Take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2011<br>Class Name: REL270<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't think she's a terrible professor, but she's definitely one of the worst I've had at DePaul. I've had many professors I've disagreed with before but was still okay to get along with. I found her to be rather rigid in opinion and it reflected in her grading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2010<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I particularly like her teaching style, its basically her lecturing the entire class and us asking questions. Even if you haven't done the reading you can just clarify your doubts about everything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2010<br>Class Name: REL270<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Some are turned off by her traditionalist methods but she has the skill of not letting the students go off subject too much, which is helpful in the long run.  She just has a 'pragmatic historian' approach.  Only take it if youre willing to read a lot and put in a lot of effort. She's a good professor, just not for everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2010<br>Class Name: HIST268<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a fan of her teaching methods! She teaches by asking questions and having the students answer the ENTIRE time. If she does lecture, it's boring and very choppy which makes it a little hard to take notes but if you do the readings, you'll be fine. Hate to say it, but the class actually made me LESS interested in Ireland.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2010<br>Class Name: HST286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring professor. Work almost unbearable. Assigned a large research paper and an exam for both the Midterm and the Final. Very willing to help, but class is not interesting. If you want to fulfill your religion requirement with a fun/decent class, then avoid her at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2009<br>Class Name: HST268<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i had her for irish history and i found the material relatively easy once she explained it but it is a lot of reading and effort. Midterm was essay which was really easy, 2 versions of a final paper due, each 20% of your grade. Basically participate and do readings and you'll be fine. She does believe highly in footnotes..so learn how to do them!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really not a bad professor at all. I think the people complaining are upset because they have to put some effort into it. Yes it's all lecture, but this is college. And maybe if the person 2 below this had any grammar competence, s/he would possibly appreciate her a little more.  I recommend her. Not an easy A, but you do learn.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2008<br>Class Name: HIST240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had her for history of ireland.  I'm a history major, i have never been so bored in a class.  She will correct you if you are not 100% right on, and that leads to no participation in the class.  Extremely hard grader 3 misspelled words and you are likely to get a c.  She is just boring as a rock Avoid.  Fuddy Duddy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2008<br>Class Name: HST268<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HISTORY OF IRELAND,FUN MATERIAL, VERY BORING LADY. NEVER ANSWERS QUESTIONS DIRECTLY. SAYS UM 50 TIMES IN CLASS. KEEP ATTENDANCE E/PERIOD. READ 2 BOOKS AT SAME TIME. LOVES THE FOSTER BOOK. TAKES MATERIAL FROM THERE CUT AND PASTE MATERIAL FROM BOOK, JUST USE FOOT NOTES. WILL NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS ON TIME MUST PARTICIPATE READ EVERYTHING.

Was not thrilled about taking this class, but found her to be incredibly interesting (and I took it as a night class!). Would highly recommend her- lectures and tests aren't bad, interview paper is really interesting. If you're willing to put forth some effort, it's a great class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2008<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY nice woman. I had night class, & she keeps you until the very last second every week. Lectures get boring. Take notes & you'll do fine. 3 papers(easy), 2  tests, 1 final paper(hard). Lots ex.credit opp. Study & go to class you'll do fine. I was in a remedial class & everyone as SO STUPID, but i still rec. her. Easily can get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2007<br>Class Name: REL180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This lady really knows what she's talking about.  Take detailed notes and with a little light studying, you'll get an A.  Very understanding if you cant come to class for a real reason.  Extreamly helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2007<br>Class Name: REL180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor McCain is very knowledgable.  She is able to defend and teach the faith, and can respond intelligently and politely to almost every question asked.  I didn't find the grading hard, although I did grow up through Catholic schools.  If you are not a Catholic this course is still worthwhile; she welcomes everybody and teaches incredible well</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. McCain is one of m favorite teachers that I've ever had. She's extremely knowledgable and can communicate well. I found that many students who were not catholic, came out of the class with all of their misconceptions put to rest and a better understanding and love for catholicism.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2005<br>Class Name: CTH200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful woman.  She has a great understanding of Catholicism and makes the topic interesting.  She is a tough grader.  Also she has some very ignorant views on common day issues.  But other than that she is amazing</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: CTH200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice lady, tries to explain things clearly, grading is a little tough, not a blow off class but you learn a lot about the catholic religion.  Exams are essay/ short answer blue book, and you have to write one 6-8 page paper and three one page papers</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2004<br>Class Name: CTH200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Went to Catholic grade school & attended CCD for many years.
