Professor Nowotarski has real world experience which translates well in his classes. There is a lot of work in the course, but the assignments do an excellent job of reinforcing what we learn in lecture.  Buckle down, do the work and ask questions--He is very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is awesome!

His quizzes, final, assignments are easy, but you will need the book for the quizzes only, and you need a bit long time to do the homework. I highly recommend taking classes with him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: IS372<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgable and has real world experience. Very clear, and good teacher. Subject matter got kind of dry, and the teaching style can get a little dry, but no big complaints.
