She is much better at explaining  the material than past profs (not having an accent helps). She makes you do partner work ALL THE TIME, but all the activities in class are super guided.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2015<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Spanish 103 with her, an accelerated course. Super easy if you just participate in class and do the online hw. The online stuff is 30-60 minutes  a night but not difficult, and you do need to know the stuff for class. If you pay attention, you do well on the tests. Easy tests for that reason. EASY grader. Super nice, and very attractive (;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2012<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What an amazing teacher. She is the type of person who wants to help you no matter what your level. Not so great in HS Spanish, I though I would be behind in SPN 104, but she helped everyone. She is a mom and it totally shows. She is the kindest professor and will stop and help students during before and after class. TOTALLY TAKE HER, worth it 100%</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2012<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The modern lang. department is quite difficult at depaul, but professor whitelaw makes it really interesting. super helpful and likes to do a lot of group activities. always does reviews before tests, too. HIGHLY RECOMMEND</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2012<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very very nice professor and if you put in some effort, just like any other Spanish class, you will get an A. She is very helpful and truly cares about each and every one. Only downside is that she thinks she's teaching high school kids...but still highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the best teacher everrr! loved this class, its very easy and understandable if you are willing to put in a decent amount of work.it is a language class. she really counts attendence and participation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2012<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was fine at the beginning of the class but at the end I had a family emergency and was awful. I had to miss class twice due to family commitments and she was not understanding at all. She would not allow me to make up an exam or turn in my homework. I almost went to the department head to report her. DONT TAKE HER CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2012<br>Class Name: SPAN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just want to say that she is a great teacher.  Very helpful,organized,enthusiastic and super nice!  You will do very well in her class as long as you bring a 100%.  Her Spanish is perfect and you can easily understand her.  Homework is online along with the half the quiz, other half is written.  Drops lowest quiz and homework. Def recommend.</div></div></div></body></html>
