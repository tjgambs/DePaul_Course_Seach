She really, really cares that you do well in her class if you put forth effort. She knows what she's talking about and never deflects questions -- she'll answer everything honestly. Her lectures can get dull if you don't like the subject matter but otherwise everything is framed neatly and in an interesting manner. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2014<br>Class Name: REL161<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Poirier is very passionate about what she teaches so get ready to go the extra mile on exams and essays. I honestly though this class was pretty though for a GEN ED, and if you're looking for an easy A, this is not the class. She is a fair grader but will take your work very seriously. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2014<br>Class Name: 161<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You have to read before just about every class but the readings are short. While she is a pretty tough grader she is super reasonable, respectful and flexible with her students if you need outside help, an extension, etc. You take three exams (lowest score drop, highest doubled) and write three essays. Super manageable, I highly recommend. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2014<br>Class Name: REL161<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very passionate about the topic, so she takes it very seriously. Use her as a resource for papers because she will make sure your citations are correct, otherwise you lose a lot of points on papers. One of my favorite classes here at DePaul because it teaches you the vile side of colonization. Info everyone should know.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2014<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Loved how enthusiastic she was about the subject, however, just note she's a HARD grader. You need to take really good notes about everything on the terms list. Also, she's not too clear what she expects from her essays.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2013<br>Class Name: REL161<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a great class, not even close to boring and I would recommend Professor P to anyone.  She made the subject interesting. If you cant figure out Chicago style then email her.  If you need a religious dimensions class this is it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2013<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Getting an A is a suck-up contest. Basically going in and meeting with her (even if your essay sucks) will give you a good grade. She's very unclear on her essays or what to write on her tests, and doesn't give constructive feedback either. Her teaching style is BORING. It basically a history class, not understanding the actual religions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2013<br>Class Name: REL215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Poirier was extremely helpful and very passionate about Native American religions. Her class was one of my favorites thus far at DePaul University. There are a lot of readings, but by the end of the class you learn a lot. I would definitely take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a wonderful teacher! Very knowledgeable in the subject. She is very clear when teaching and responds to emails quickly. Will help in anything a student needs. Will definitely take her again! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great instructor, enthusiastic and extremely knowledgable. Material can be a little dull, but she has great energy, explains things well and thoroughly. She's a little corny, but I happen to like that. Doesn't waste time; she will got the full hour and 30 minutes. Responds quickly to emails and is immensely helpful as long as you reach out to her</div></div></div></body></html>
