The final was online. Overall, it was an easy A. However, the lectures could get a bit boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Benson gave a ton of extra credit and was always available to help if asked. We were given tons of lectures online but I honestly only watched about 3 of the 10 and I still received an A in the class. Easy class to take online because you can google the answershave open book tests. Even without my cheating, the class was very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2014<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Professor Benson. She is funny and very smart! She does take attendance though, so many classes are mandatory. Or'Shaundra is definitely dedicated in helping many students grow, and she fosters a great open environment for discussions and debates, without ever shooting down the speaker. Love her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2013<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She replaced our teacher mid quarter. She did a better job than the other one and was completely knowledgeable with everything she taught. Highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2013<br>Class Name: PSY303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Benson was excellent! She was extremely helpful and really wanted all of her students to be successful! She is a very fair grader and she integrates interesting video clips into her lectures to make them even more engaging. I also appreciated how we had fascinating in-class discussions and on D2L. It really helped me learn the material!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
