I really enjoyed taking his class. He is clear, helpful and appreciative of hard work. His multiple choice tests can be tough, but if you read the required chapters you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very straightforward.  He is very clear on the topics and what can be expected on the exams.  He is very slow in responding to emails though.

Really cool guy, always talking about wanting to leave class for a cocktail.  Has handouts for every chapter and basically asks you want you want on your quizes/exams.  He treats us like people who dont understant accounting, which is awesome for a 101 class.  Take him!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
