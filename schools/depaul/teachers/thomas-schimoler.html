He gave us a midterm where the "highest theoretical grade" was a 92 out of 100. He is extremely knowledgeable, but his lectures are boring and he made the class unbelievably difficult. Do not take CSC 383 online unless you want to fail.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2012<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know if it was just the class or if it was the professor, but LSP 121 was really easy for me with Schimoler. He took the time to explain things clearly and gave plenty of time to get the homework done. He also helped people out that needed to miss class for different events. He's really laid back and easy to learn from.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An overall nice guy. His classes could be kind of dull when lectures were about ancient games, but he was definitely knowledgeable. The one bad thing about the class was how long it took him to grade things. At the end of the quarter only one of the four papers were graded. If you do the readings then quizzes will be easy, but you HAVE to do them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2011<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Schimoler is low key but very helpful.  His class was well organized and fun to attend.  Grading was fair.  Study games for a history credit!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: IT124<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is extremely knowledgeable.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
