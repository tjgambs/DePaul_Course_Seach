Everything we did for class was very interesting and current! We got to write a paper about ourselves, analyze memes, and analyze commercials. This class was not boring at all! He also gives really good feedback on  papers. I thought that I was a decent writer but he helps you understand how it could be better!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2014<br>Class Name: FORGOTLOL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Very kind professor. Lets students take charge of the class by allowing multiple class discussions on very interesting novels. Hamlet was by far the best discussion. Easy grader if you know how to write, you can get the older edition of the book at the library or ishare</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Trongeau is such a great teacher! Probably one of the best teachers I've ever had. The class wasn't hard, and it was super fun and I actually learned a lot! The literature we read was interesting too. I totally recommend this class, it was the best class I've taken so far at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was thoroughly enjoyable. Professor Trongeau made class very interesting and everything that we read led to great class discussions. There were a lot of journals that we had to write but they were all a very reasonable length. Also many extra credit opportunities. WARNING: don't buy bookstore books. All the readings are available online</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2014<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this class with him! He does NOT try to be cool to whoever said that. His passion for the subject definitely shows through and he welcomes all opinions. Kind can be a tough grader, but gives you the option to edit and re-submit some papers after you turned them in. Don't buy the book though, you can just look up the poems and stories online.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2012<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny and easy to get along with. Respects others' opinions about texts and gives great feedback. Definitely not a boring class. 3 quizzes, no midterm, 1 creative project (your choice), and a final. No big deal at all. Anyone who needs an English class should definitely take his.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2011<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. I would recommend Darren to other students he is clear in what he expects from students and makes class entertaining. You will enjoy this class and it is an easy A if you just come to class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!! I HATED english classes before, but this class was so good. I learned ALOT & my writing drastically improved. He makes class entertaining and keeps your attention. You learn a lot in a fun way. He's very helpful with office hours also. His way of teaching was awesome, highly recommend him!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2010<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows his stuff and makes class interesting.  There is a lot of reading writing, but he allows for some revisions, too.  To whoever said he tries to be cool: he has passion and he's funny and enthusiastic.  those MAKE him cool!  Do the work, participate, ask for help and you'll be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't respond to e-mails usually.  If he does, it takes around a week.  Unreliable.  Class wasn't that interesting.  Tried too hard to be &quot;cool&quot;, but ultimately was annoying.  Would not recommend class unless you're uber-passionate about literature.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes class really entertaining.  Helps students get through the writing process easily by requiring drafts throughout the quarter so you don't procrastinate and have a huge paper to write one night.  Cancels class often.  Recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such a passionate, fun teacher. His explanations of assignments are in-depth and clear. The lectures are informative and helpful to the writing process. I would recommend him to anyone who is looking to learn about writing and needs the WRD104 course. The work is time-consuming, but will pay off in the end if you are committed. Great class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was alright. He's very wishy-washy, not sure what he's looking for. He is really nice though and really helpful. If you just try at the assigments he's a fair grader. He's kind of picky about things though. not an easy A WRD but with some effort you can get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Darren is an awesome teacher!  He wants his students to succeed, and everything that he asks for during the course is manageable.  I was also quite entertained by his enthusiasm, an easy A if you do the work.  He is flexible and if you pay the slightest bit of attention, his passion will spark your interest.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Trongeau was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I learned so much from this class and it was my favorite of the entire quarter! Don't expect to be able to slack off; he's a fair grader. You have to put in some effort. DEFINITELY take his classes, you won't regret!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2009<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's kinda cute in a freaky way. He's hilarious too, but often we get way too off topic. He assigns a lot of papers but seems to not have enough time to grade them. Needs to respond to emails better. Overall, funny, entertaining, knowledgeable and fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Meh, he's alright. He is nice and entertaining but at times he is too much. He also thinks hes a really good teacher, and he is not a bad teacher but I would not say I learned anything in the class that I didn't know before hand. I would say to take his class because its not bad and fairly easy, but I wouldn't say you HAVE to take it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>FAVORITE! SO much fun! hilarious! and really knows his stuff. tries hard to make things interesting and relatable. really helps you become better at writing and analyzing texts. everything sounds overwhelming at first but he walks you through it. attendance was mandatory but i enjoyed going anyway! so cool, so funny, such a great prof!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wholeheartedly agree with the last two posts.  The class is worth taking in many ways.  Take it and you won't regret it.  Darren is genuinely sincere and honest and extremely passionate about English whcih makes the class that much more enjoyable. A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a good class. Darren makes literature fun and gives you every chance to have a good grade. He is helpful and there is a good amount of work but not too much. Take the class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2009<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE IS AMAZING!! This class has a good amount of work but it is worth it. It will not be a walk in the park but it will not take up all your time. I learned a lot & actually enjoyed doing the work for the class. He is just so fun to be around! TAKE THIS CLASS!!! It is so great! I would take any class from him again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2008<br>Class Name: ENG101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is amazing and cute. I had a wonderful time in his class and enjoyed every minute of it. He keeps interest in his students and has no troubleing helping them out. Its an easy class as long as your participate and do the readings. If you ever get the chance to take him I highly suggest it! I am hoping I can soon.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I seriously loved this class because of Darren.  He made learning tedious subjects (grammar) interesting, and I actually miss WRD 104.  I highly recommend taking a class with Darren if you ever get the chance!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2008<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great teacher that is always willing to help his students. very fair and very helpful when it comes to the research paper. would definitely recommend any class he teaches</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher!

Makes English at 8:30AM fun and interesting. He also cancels class often cuz of bike trouble. Highly recommended...you just write like 6 papers all quarter and he gives you lots of feedback for what he wants you to correct in your papers, before he gives you a grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he definitely knows what he's talking about and likes what he teaches, but he's very often times disorganized and unclear. this class was also not challenging at all and i found myself bored most of the time. his essay topics are all about writing. and it gets very old to write 4-6 pages on the topic of writing. but he is a very nice guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great guy! knows what hes talking about. will help you with any paper. cancels classes sometimes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>interesting</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy is awesome. I hate english and he made the class really fun.
