The projects he assigned helped me grow so much as an artist and he gives really great feedback. This class is super laid back, but certain projects can be a bit challenging.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher, but there are lots of assignments which are very rushed. Therefore, the students have to spend several hours outside of class. He is a very cool singer/artist/person. His suggestions on our projects were helpful and he was always willing to help through email as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2012<br>Class Name: ART264<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class.
