She has a very confusing teaching method that left most of our class frustrated and doing poorly on the midterm and final. She gets angry if students ask questions.

I took her last quarter for Acc 101 and this quarter for Acc 102. Accounting is not the easiest class for many students, I can see that. However, she does her best in helping students to pass. If you pay attention, she will get you ready for the midterm and the final. I got an A in my 101 class, by the way.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Wendorf is wonderful.

She does not explain her materials well and she takes attendance. I've e-mailed her a few times but did not reply back to any of them. When we ask questions, she seems to get annoyed sometimes. I would not recommend her if you want to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good person, but horrible at teaching.

She does want her students to do well and is always willing to help.  To be successful in this course, which I learned, is that YOU MUST ASK QUESTIONS ON STUFF YOU ARE CONFUSED WITH.  She will go more in detail if you ask questions, and will do so during office hours.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice, helpful, and pleasant.  There seems to be a disconnect in the class however.  I don't find her lectures to be very clear and struggle because of it.  She does ask if everyone understands, but doesn't modify her teaching style when we don't.  It's hard to dislike her because she seems to genuinely want her students to do well and is likeable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>How this teacher has negative comments is beyond me. Really sweet lady, cares about her students, and is lenient on grading. She's disorganized at all, powerpoints each class and explains everything thoroughly. But, just like any other class, it does require effort on the student's part. Take her, if the opportunity presents itself.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She can't teach in my opinion. She is very unorganized and doesn't explain the power points very well.

She used to teach elementry so she really makes things easy! :) take her, but study!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2010<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A bit too wishy washy for acc prof.

Her powerpoints and notes do not help with the homework at all! She does not prepare you well enough for the midterm or final. Everyone did pretty bad and she does not curve. One time we had a substitute and she made everything Wendorf taught a lot easier to understand. Take a different professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: ACC100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At the beginning she was helpful but after Chapter 3 she was always rushed to finish the lecture; we were always behind in class. She gives you notes, you might think thats a plus, but they werent helpful. Her online quizzes suck!Everybody in class had to read the whole book numerous times in order to understand the material.Not helpful at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT TEACHER!!! If you dont get something ask her she will explain it to you until you get it. Good amount of homework which is useful. If you want to do good sit in the front and really pay attention. She is a really good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is hard not necessarily due to the teacher. Its just a hard topic. In the beginning she was helpful and timely but in the end she got quick and never returned things on time. You need the book. Honestly taking any teacher would be just as hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wendorf was nice enough. It's definitely possible to get an A but be prepared to work hard. The classes and powerpoints are NOT helpful!  I ended up teaching myself through the book and from eduspace. Lot's of guess and check with eduspace. Midterm and final were really hard. The lab does boost your grade though! I do not recommend this professor!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am assuming all the negitive grades are from one person only who might have suck at accounting him/her self.. not the professor fault!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an amazing professor. I don't agree with the comments below. I think she is great , her class is not boring like other accounting class , makes jokes and like to have fun. She puts her full effort in teaching and try to get us through.the quizes and home work is all online and can be checked b4 submitting , that a straight 50% of ur grade!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT again DO NOT take Professor Wendorf!!!! Her class consists of Power Points for each Chapter.. and these power points are such BS.. they don't even highlight the main points of the chapter!  You basically end up teaching your self how to do all the problems.  If you take her then expect to learn on your own through eduspace!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For an intro to Accounting class I would take a different teacher. She is condescending and at times rude. She gives you quizzes and homework due the day of the midterm and the final. Doesn't really curve is very unorganized. If you go to her office she makes you feel stupid. Some of the other professors have much higher reviews, take them</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tries to be funny but that doesnt work for her! Dont bother going to her office or asking her for help, she'll either tell you that you should know the answer by now or she'll just leave you more confused. Waits till like a week before the final to put up the slides on  blackboard & assigns hw and a quiz right before the final. Avoid her if u can!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take mickey; she is very unorganized and doesn't take a great effort in seeing her students succede.

Hard to follow material. Tons of homework. She makes you feel dumb when you don't understand something. One of the worst at DePaul.

Incredibly unorganized! I cannot believe that anyone in the real world will respect her. She makes too many mistakes and gives a lame explanation to cover it up. She checks attendance, and you have the option of learning from the textbook or eduspace.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: ACC202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>first test was take home and online. over 6 quizes online. curves the grade. not clear on subject. final test avg grade was 79 of 133. if you wanna learn take someone else</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall a good teacher. She tends to keep things pretty plain and simple so its easy to understand. Homework is modest and not to hard. Test aren't to hard either. As long as you pay attention in class and do the HW you will be fine. She also posts all of the notes on Blackboard so you don't really have to take any notes yourself which is nice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2008<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The subject is not exciting.  Really cares about what you learn.  If you do what you're supposed to, the class isn't too hard.  She gives you alot of stuff on Blackboard to help study.  SUA was intense, but helpful.  Don't know what class some of these reviewers were going to -- she covers the SUA in class and I got help online and in her office.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2008<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mickey is a kook! Very pleasant teacher and knows her stuff well. The material is basic common sense but the tests are way harder. Few take home quizzes, take home midterm, 50% take home final, and kind of hard but fun SUA project. Little curve for the final grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2008<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not helpful, not clear, awkward, not sure how to learn from her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take AIS with Mrs. Wendorf. She has no real world experience and is VERY unorganized! Her lectures consist of her reading the slides, as college students we know how to read. Wasted our money and time. Picks favorites in class to give extra. Txt book is useless.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2008<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Have you heard of boring&#63; Well, she is the definition. She is not funny, eventhough she tries to be. If you can take another teacher. The Mid-term and final were easy (assuming that you read the material), but this does not compensate for the time spent in her BORING class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2008<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grade SUA so harshly and doesnt tell you how to do it in class or after. Her exams have essay questions and audit case which I heard they do it at home. No sense of humor and definitely avoid. Study slides only if that helps any.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2008<br>Class Name: ACC202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her for 101 and 102, class was fairly easy.

Lied about never having used the homework software before. Get a 100% on every homework assignment and you'll get under 100% for the section of your grade. Lazy, doesn't teach, useless.

Midterm was multiple choice straight from the slides. Final had short answer/essay &#63;'s (much more difficult).

Her lectures are a bit on the boring side and her jokes are cheesy, but overall I'd take her again. She takes attendence.

Not so bad!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2006<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice lady and tries to be helpful.

She does try to be helpful, but she rushes through everything, and is unclear as to what is on the test.  I can never get those hours of my life back, and aside from an A, I have nothing else to show for it... I feel dumber having taken this class.  Good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2005<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest ACC class ever, though boring.  I haven't studied once, did the SUA the night before due and doodled during lectures, still got an A.  Her jokes aren't funny but you can rip on her and she laughs with you.

I had Murphy for acc 101 and she was harder. Wendorf at least goes through the homework and she puts notes up on blackboard. Accounting is a hard subject and it is difficult to grasp, if you are failing or doing bad maybe it accounting is not your thing and most of the teachers are not easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE. She is very obnoxious.  Makes things that are quite simple ideas (once I learned them on my own from the book) very unclear and hard to understand.  Her quizes are like riddles.

She is the worst teacher EVER. Don't let her niceness fool you. She is extremely disorganized, unprepared for class, and tells the corniest jokes.
