Be sure to read all the assigned articles & participate in class. Discussions are very open, so you always have something to talk about. She's a very nice person, though, and gave yummy brownies on the last day of class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This class changed my life. Get ready to have your preconceived notions of feminism and women's studies thrown out the window. Intersectionality is stressed in her classes. She's kind of small and very intimidating but also very friendly? She's a great professor, just be ready to read a lot of articles and be part of discussion in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mukherjee grades way too hard. The course is repetitive which makes it difficult to come up with enough content for any of the papers. She will refute anything you say for no reason. She has old teaching styles and feels the need to be overly strict. Even when I asked for help she just said "it's too late in the quarter". No guidance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2014<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>She was really sweet and she kept me interested. I had never taken a course on this topic before and I'm sure glad I did! I would take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2013<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class and this professor! She is absolutely incredible and from the moment she began class, I was completely interested! She is very experienced and engaging! Prof. Mukherjee made me so fascinated with WGS that I made the choice to double major in it! Be prepared to participate, but the discussions were so enjoyable! :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: WGS200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Mukherjee is a really nice woman, but I am not a fan of her teaching. She often struggled with how to convey complex issues in a way that students who are new to transnational feminism could understand. She also lectured WAY TOO MUCH! There needed to be more engagement and discussion to keep me remotely engaged.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: WGS200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!!! She is such a sweet and sincere woman. Readings were very interesting, along with other material she presented such as clips and movies. She is very helpful and promotes class discussions. I highly suggest taking her!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2011<br>Class Name: WGS200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Mukherjee is a very nice woman and sharp as a tack but this class is just brutal. Seriously. Even the most committed students will struggle to get As in this class. It is ridiculous. Very reading intensive and the readings are often boring. Give her a couple of years (she is a new teacher) and give her space to grow. Until then, stay away.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
