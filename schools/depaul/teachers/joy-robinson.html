Assignments hard to understand some requirements. But i work part parttime and just got asked to write a status report on the project. We covered these in class. Its been a great help!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2013<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I never felt the need to leave a review for a teacher until now. The class is a mess. She is unforgiving and relentless with the work, and completely unhelpful. She lives in her own little bubble, apparently oblivious the detriment the course is having on the students. She has no business being in the front of the classroom, and must be stopped.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2013<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fully agree with the other comments. She is absolutely terrible. She gives unclear instructions on homework and doesn't explain anything in class. Avoid her or get ready to throw your money away.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2013<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've been to 2 classes and completed one assignment so far. The study material for that was 3 videos (of PowerPoint) totaling over 90 minutes. Our next assignment involves outlining a 474 pg manual and we have 2 other assignments due the same day.  She barely teaches any material in class and her instructions are completely vague on everything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THIS IS THE WORST TEACHER FOR THIS CLASS. SHE IS NICE BUT THE ASSIGNMENTS ARE LONG AND CONFUSING. THIS IS NOT AN EASY A AT ALL. THE RESUME YOU MAKE IS NOT EVEN FOR YOURSELF. SHE IS 3 WEEKS BEHIND ON GRADING FOR A 5 WEEKS CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2011<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher is horrible. She is not clear at all about what she wants in the beginning of class. Class is completely unorganized. Returns grades late. Doesn't give clear instructions. She seems like she knows what she is talking about, but does not know how to teach the material. Her comments can be random at times. Stay away from her at all costs!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
