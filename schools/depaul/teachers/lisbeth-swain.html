She willingly admits that the activities that are assigned in the hybrid model are pointless, and we still do them.  She cannot answer questions that students have and refers people to content that we have already been confused by.  Nice but not worth the struggle. Hard grader</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2014<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Profesora Swain is one of the best professors I've had. Although her class was challenging it was completely worth it. She was also very helpful and never let a student fall behind. Profesora Swain was also kind and considerate and treated us like adults. She never had a paper out of place and she always returned assignments promptly.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2014<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professora Swain is very energetic but not the most organized. She wants her students to be successful, but it seems like she is overwhelmed by the curriculum. Be prepared to review a lot for yourself and for online tests that aren't created by her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2012<br>Class Name: SPAN106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Profesora Swain is by far my favorite professor at DePaul. She cares so much for her students and goes above and beyond to help. Her classes are wonderful to sit in, I truly learned a lot. The work load is nothing you can't handle. Take her, she is the best Spanish professor, I guarantee it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2012<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Professor Swain for SPN 104 & 106. She is so nice. She will go out of her way to help you. The tests are hard but they're made by the department, not her. She basically gives you the homework answers and she grades super easy for compositions and projects. I love this woman!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2012<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best teacher at DePaul.  She is very helpful, well organized and knowledgeable in what she teaches you. For the most part she explained things clearly. I will definitely recommend her.-</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2012<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Swain was a wonderful teacher who was well organized and thorough in her work.However don't expect her to give you answers right away, she expects hard work and dedication. In the future i would gladly take one of her classes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2012<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Swain was a great teacher.

She wants you to succeed! Be sure to not rely on her telling you what to do, follow the syllabus on her own! I would definitely take her again though!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
