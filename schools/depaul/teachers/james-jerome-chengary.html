Class was 50% lecture and cases & 50%simulation. What made this one of my best classes was that he went outside of the box and spoke with us about project management, communication and presentation skills and even had a recruiter come in from Deloitte to prep us on interviewing. Not your typical prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2009<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the more interesting classes that I had at DePaul.  He developed this class a few years ago so he clearly has dedication to it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jimm was very disorganized and changed the requirements of the class 3/4 of the way through. Attending class was pointless and was just exercise in staying awake. I didnt learn anything from this man. If you value your education and want to get your moneys worth - STAY AWAY!</div></div></div></body></html>
