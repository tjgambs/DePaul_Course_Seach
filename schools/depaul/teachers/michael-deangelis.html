His lectures are interesting and his assignments are enjoyable. He's a fair grader and he gives great feedback on assignments. This class was super interesting and the workload was absolutely perfect. Take him! He's a great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2014<br>Class Name: MCS273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Online classes are always a toss up, but Prof. DeAngelis had a well-organized, well-run class. We got to pick out of 3 movies we wanted to watch for papers and specific feedback was given for every grade. He really wants you to do well, and as long as you watch the lectures and read over the terminology, it's hard not to do well</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: MCS348<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Michael is great! Not enough space to praise him. He is clear and always makes his classes fun! Would take again. I looked forward to going to this class every week. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2011<br>Class Name: MCS273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took his Film/Video Analysis class, and I have to say that it is the one class that I look most forward to for the entire week. The three hour lecture can be a bit much, but he always makes sure that everyone knows what he's talking about and loves when people give their own examples. Possibly my favorite teacher here at DePaul so far!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
