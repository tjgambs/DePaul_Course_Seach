Ed is a fantastic person and professor. His class is essential for those who are unsure of where there career path is going. This class taught me so much about myself, my values, and helped me decide what I wanted to do after college. I networked with many people through his course as well!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2014<br>Class Name: UIP240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Ed was great. I took this 2 credit class because the university called me about it and I decided why not. Thanks to Ed for completely redoing my resume I landed an office job and I am sure there is more to come. You have to show up to pass, and it's extra work but a GPA booster. Highly recommend.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2012<br>Class Name: UIP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher,made class very interesting, Very helpful, gives great advise on careers,cares about his students. Hard grader,but class is very useful. If you are undecided on what you want to do next, GO TALK to him .</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2012<br>Class Name: UIP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST professor at DePaul, hands down. No other teacher cares more about your future and career options than this guy--he is ALWAYS offering to help and guide you. He LOVES what he does and it's very obvious. Class consists of a portfolio, papers, and discussion boards. Don't miss class, its 2% of your grade each time you miss!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2011<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Made class on a Saturday interesting, so that in itself is impressive. Otherwise a decent professor who actually cares about what he is teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2011<br>Class Name: ISP220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I want to do him.

Made class at 9am on a Saturday interesting, and I'm considering a new career after taking the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2008<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the online internship course and for the most part it was easy.  Keeping up with discussions is a pain, but the papers aren't complicated.  The biggest complaint I have is about grading.  This prof. doesn't use the grading board on blackboard and I constantly had to email him to figure out my progress.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is easy going. He enjoys what he does for a living and it shows. Do the blackboard assignments and all is good.  Keeps class at a comfortable place (didn't like the circle seating, why&#63;) Take him, u won't regret it. Teaches real-life materials. Only meet 4xs during the qtr.! He's a good guy. He's cute and funny, why is he single&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2005<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teach - didnt get the grade i expected and i dont know why since i got near perfect on all my assignments but after the qaurter i was too tired to argue - just keep up with the blackboard stuff which is very tedious and do the papers and youll be fine - he got us food a few times and made the class very worthwhile - def recommended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was O.K. but he was kind of mean sometimes. He would ignore people and stuff. He did get us food a couple times and I got a good grade so overall he's straight.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2005<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice and funny guy. Knows his stuff! Makes you feel comfortable in class and he's easy to talk too. I left his class feeling like a actually learned something that will help me out later on in life. Make sure you do your blackboard work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! As long as you participate in the blackboard readings and do the work, you'll be fine.  I enjoyed this class very much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/15/2005<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's cool and makes this class very interesting, but he is really into MBTI, so becareful because he judges your character before he even gets to know you.  Otherwise take his class because he makes it very enjoyable and has some very wise advice to give.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2005<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2005<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Approach to the course was excellent!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2005<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He nice...but I can see why he is still single.
