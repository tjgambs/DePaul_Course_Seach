He's been unprepared for a few exams and isn't familiar with his material.  He reads right from the slides.  Overall he is fair and has good insight to marketing however.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2010<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worthless   Will not respond to  email. I have never postd on this site, but felt I had to with this botch job professor. Prepare for 16 of the most useless homework assignments ever.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor. A lot of material but not his fault-thats how marketing is. Heavy use of PP-don't need to go to the book. A lot of real life experience on the PP and answering questions or explaining concepts. Two easy quizzes, midterm, final and a team presentation. Homework due every class- 2 pg. on two topics. Liked it-interesting class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2010<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>avoid if possible. hard course, and doesn't help students. no communication in emails at all, he will ignore all emails.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
