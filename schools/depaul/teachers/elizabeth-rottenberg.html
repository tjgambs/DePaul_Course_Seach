Yes she is a stickler for proper grammar, but language is her specialty. The class was incredibly interesting, she encouraged discussion, and was very knowledgable about the subject. She grades fairly and was more than willing to help students as needed. I highly recommend any of her courses!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: CPL210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fabulous class!!!  Readings were great (lots of Greek tragedy).  I loved reading Medea.  Prof. is very funny.  I highly recommend this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: CPL210<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting concept and ideas behind madness and all philosophy readings. Teacher is sort of bashed all ideas students had that were not what she thought. very closed minded. When we wrote our protocol paper we had to read aloud and she tore apart all our grammar errors and of the text in front of the whole class. Very rude.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2012<br>Class Name: PHL206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The topic of evil in a philosophical and situational perspectives was amazing. Kant is fantastic. And none of it would be understood without Elizabeth leading the class. She's a fantastic teacher. Pay attention and you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2011<br>Class Name: PHL357<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent class!

We read a ton of stuff, all of it good.  Prof. has a fabulous sense of humor.  And knows her****.  I definitely recommend this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2010<br>Class Name: PHL314<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic!!!  I had a great time and learned a lot and read a lot of great stuff.  Prof. is excellent on Kant (for you, philosophy majors).   I would recommend this class to anyone.  Prof. is hot--and funny!  A great combination.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2009<br>Class Name: PHL341<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, smart, relaxed. I liked her. Kinda hated the class (idk why I took it) b/c philosophy's not my forte, especially of aesthetics (uh), but she made it less insufferable than it otherwise might've been. Participation is important I guess, but I'm quiet by nature and I did OK. Just pay attention, show up to class, do your work, you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: PHL206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class. No tests, papers are graded hard, but fair.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: PHL357<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best class I've taken.  Prof. is a genius and very funny.  Guy who listed PHL377 (below) is an idiot.  Prof. didn't teach that class or I would have taken it.  I take everything she teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2007<br>Class Name: ISP210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked her, her discussions were REALLY interesting and she was really lenient with assignments and papers.  Kept classes interesting and created a really lax environment.  I would recommend her to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2007<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was a great intro philosophy class.  Professor lectured a bit too long sometimes; lectures were often dry.  Papers are graded fairly but not easily; she expects college level work.  Would recommend, but make sure to be involved in class.  She will call you out if you say something stupid and can be a bit harsh.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2007<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the class itself was interesting - she was a bit harsh sometimes (especially for a predominately freshman class).  grading was pretty easy - lectures were often way too much of her talking with big words that made me sleepy.  overall the class is okay, not too much work, the books are very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2005<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is pretty easy on papers. She is a little boring, but class is not that painful.   SHe is pretty tough on grammar and spelling, though.  Be sure to proofread.  I recom. her to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2005<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>sort of a strange teacher. seems to be very intelligent, but difficult to listen to when she lectures. the readings weren't bad, but she grades HARD on the papers. no drafts, but lets you re-write first one. total of 3 writing assignments - VERY picky about grammar. I got a B</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: PHL377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard class, but very nice teacher. She knows the material very well and does everthing possible for students to understand the class. Very helpful when I went to her office! I would take her again. Partcipation is very important! Make sure you talk to her if there is something you don't undertand!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this lady is so awesome.  she knows her stuff.  tests are not bad at all if you keep up with readings and class discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's passionate about the subject but is not very clear on what she wants from you. If you don't understand philosophy, don't take the class. I had a hard time participating in the class because she made it hard for students to understand what was going on. Don't take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her! All u have to do is read and know what ur talking about enough to make a few comments the next day in class.. Funny..cool teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy! You only need to write like half of ONE paper! And all you have to write what was said about the day before. Just make sure to read the text and attend class. Whether you understand it or not, she goes over it. Only two tests, and all you have to do is look over your notes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her.  The reading made my eyes bleed, but she actually helped me understand it much more.  She's a bit uptight, but come on, she teaches philosophy... the subject itself is based on ideals.  Her ideal is that we sit through the whole class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: EPISTEMOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is very intelligent and passionate about her work, but the course is demanding.  Attend class, participate, and write concisely. She is a difficult grader on papers and is highly speculative of grammar and language with the papers. Other than that, you will learn alot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought this teacher was great.  Class was easy as hell as long as you paid attention to what you were reading and actually interacted in the classroom.  My suggestion, if you don't mind reading, or making one or two comments during class, go ahead and take her because that's all it takes...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have any idea what you're doing in college don't take this course.  Although the professor is passionate about her work, you will have no clue as to what your work actually is.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO YOUR READING! Participation is key also</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't like her as a professor. Though she really does care about the material, she's totally unclear about what she wants and VERY concerned about grammar mistakes. The only real work was reading, which you definitely have to do.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible, horrible teacher. Do not take her class! She made us buy a book that we didn't even use! She was consistently late for class, but if one of the students left early she would spaz about it. Not professional at all. The class was a waste of time!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2003<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this lady doesnt really know how to teach, pretty hard to get an A, borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2003<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teach really boring... but yea never clearly states wat she wants for her papers...
