Prof. Darrow was such a sweetheart, and her huge passion for film was definitely evident. Her feedback on our work was always incredibly helpful, and class itself was so much fun. I almost wish that I hadn't passed so I could take the course again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this class and loved Professor Darrow. She has a thick french accent but is easily understandable. She gives great lectures and you seriously learn A LOT from her. She made me love screenwriting. This is a fun class and you always watch movie clips of relevant films. She will help you in person or through email! Definitely recommend her!  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is AMAZING!

She has a thick French accent, however she manages to effectively lecture. We watched several interesting shorts and scenes that I really enjoyed. Her expectations are straightforward and her criticisms are very useful. Follow her guidelines and put forth the effort and you will do well in this class.</div></div></div></body></html>
