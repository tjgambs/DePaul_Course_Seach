There are weekly assignments and in class group. The work can sometimes be difficult,but just ask for her help and she will walk you through it. As long as you show up to class you should be fine. Your grade is heavily padded by the homework and group work,so if you don't do too hot on exams you're ok.  TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice lady. She's funny and down to earth. ALWAYS willing to help with group work and homework. Work is not too difficult but like I said, she will walk you through it if you don't understand. Pleasant professor, highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazingly clear and very nice.
