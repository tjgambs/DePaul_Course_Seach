Just need to know how to write an essay, because there's 3. Otherwise, you're gonna watch a lot of movies and listen to him get off topic.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: DC202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Basically just watch movies and write about them. There is some assigned reading but it's light and not really required to understand what is going on. Only assignments are 3 essays. Sometimes he says weird things like, &quot;GIVE THAT MAN A CHERU!&quot; if they answer a question correctly. I would recommend him to anyone mildly interested in film.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: DC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lou is one of the best.  We learned Final Cut, and while he isn't the most technical prof, he really knows editing theory.  His lectures can be a bit long/unrelated to class, but he's such a friendly, entertaining guy that I didn't mind.  The only assignments were 3 editing projects that he will help you with.  Don't need the books to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: DC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THis class was really great, I learned how to use Avid Express really well.  He is a great teacher as well (he has Emmys!!)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: DC202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great professor! In his class all we did was watch movies and write papers (2-3 pages) on the editing. He is a great man with good connections so if you want in the movie industry he's the perfect guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2006<br>Class Name: EDITINGII<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lou knows his stuff.  Everyone should take his class and learn from his experience in the movie biz as a sound and film editor.
