Don't expect a blow off class, since he expects you to work for your grade, but he clearly wants his students to succeed and is always there to help you develop ideas. Plus, he's got a good sense of humor during critiques, which makes them less stressful if you're shy like me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2015<br>Class Name: MULTIPLEGD<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Shiro is probably one of the best teachers at DePaul and is definitely the best teacher I've ever had. I've never seen a teacher who is so universally liked and respected that still taught his class well. One thing to watch for is that he dose expect you to put effort into the class, so it's not a blow off class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2014<br>Class Name: GD<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Shiro is an awesome guy, really inspiring and cool. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: NMS503<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely helpful, encouraging and very talented.

However, it's not really clear what he's looking for, and with 1 week left in the class, I have no idea what grade to expect. Also, the class moves way too slowly for my liking.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2007<br>Class Name: ART358<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes you feel stupid... and i mean that in the best/nicest way possible. He'll teach you everything Jason and Ray skipped over and take all your designs to the next level. I can see such a HUGE improvement in my designs after taking his class. He's big on one-on-one feedback and brainstorming w/ classmates. Fave design prof in the dept.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2005<br>Class Name: GRAPHICDESIGN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2005<br>Class Name: DESIGNCAPSTONE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2005<br>Class Name: ART241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shiro is the best damn teacher in the Art Department.
