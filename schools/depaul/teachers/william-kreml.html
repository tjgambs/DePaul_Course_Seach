I approached him twice with questions, but he was absolutely useless. He spent no more then 5 mins reviewing the midterm and final, which had nothing to do with the essay question.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: PSC263<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>&quot;If you do the readings and study for the tests you will be fine&quot;&#63;&#63; again kids rating on here are ridiculous. What happens if you dont do the readings and study for the tests&#63;&#63;huh&#63; common sense! your comments are disgusting with no real critique!

He was interesting and we studied supreme court cases. If you do the readings and review notes you will do fine.

A lot of supreme court cases but if you do the reading you will get an A. Great huy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have only been a student of his for two class lectures, but that was enough time to convince me to drop his class and create this rating. He's a 67 y/o man that lectures from his head, often rumbling indistinctly.  He writes chicken scratch on the board and his lectures have no organization.  It's supposed to be a 100 level but i was lost already</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
