She reads people well, so she can tell when people are started to zone out and creatively gets people interested again. She has a good sense of humor, and loves when people share real world experiences. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2013<br>Class Name: MGT325<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class. Not very difficult or time consuming. Take home midterm & final.

She really looks out for students, and willing to do whatever is necessary to pass students. Class is challenging. Hw is 20% Attendance/Partic 10% Midterm 35% Final 35%. She curves if the class does bad. Also if you fail the midterm she will give you the option to weigh it less. Highly recommended!!! Wish more teach like her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: MNG301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her tests are hard but she gives a decent curve. You can also use a formula sheet on the tests. Hw takes hours to complete and its done online. She is nice but not very passionate about the subject. She always says that once she goes home she never thinks about any of the material etc. Goes thru examples really fast . . . Overall alright teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: MGT398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing as always! Very knowledgeable and soo passionate about the topic - Sustainability. Highly recommended and I'll be missing her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2009<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class during the summer so it moved pretty quickly.  For me, the class turned out to be an easy 'A'.  Her exams consisted mainly of problem solving and we were allowed to bring a formula sheet with us.  Her multiple choice questions were not that difficult.  As long as you pay attention and read the chapters you should do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2009<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was scared that Professor Dhanda might be a tough grader by reading some of the comments but I found that it was the exact oppisite.  She was an extremely easy grader and presented the class material well.  She can be helpful but you must ask questions or she will continue teaching. Midterm and Final were both easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2009<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very friendly and helpful, but remember that you must ask questions if you need help! Quite harsh when it comes to grading...the class actually isn't that easy as I originally thought. Pay attention to those problems and make sure you know how to compute all of them!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2009<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Should have been an easy A, but she takes pride in &quot;grading like a hawk&quot; -- she didn't really teach any of the material and relied solely on the slides from the publisher.  Felt like I was taking a class in high school.  A real disappointment.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: MNGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady and a decent professor. She has trouble breaking down material to a more simplistic approach and expects too much of her students often leading to frustration. She uses a stupid homework system online that hardly works and gives tons of material. She does allow for you to re-weight the final if you do poorly on the midterm which is great.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very pleasant and friendly person, but her lessons and approach are hard to understand. Not a language barrier but she is at such a high level it is hard for her to break things down. She was not clear in her guidelines. A true disappointment :(</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2008<br>Class Name: MGT230<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a hard grader, super nice. If you do homework and go over the problems you should do well on the final. The final is HARD, she doesn't curve.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2007<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher. Tests are really hard, especially the midterm. You need to practice the problems over and over again to be able to complete them in the alotted time on the test.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2007<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Dhanda is one of the best I ever had at depaul! class consist of mid-term and final (total 60%), the rest is group homework, in class work, and participation. She is very nice just study the material is not very hard to understand!!! I love her =)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2007<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very good professor.  Hands out all materials.  Lets you know what's on tests.  H/W is done in groups which helps out a lot.  Exams are pretty straightforward because you know what will be on them. Also, her long hair when it comes undone from her ponytail is sexy.  Very good management prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2007<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kathy is very fun and an easy prof</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2006<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seems like she cares for her students but i dind't feel so.  she is kinda easy sometimes hard to understand and i think she grades hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2006<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dhanda is great... she's so nice, and really cares about what's going on with her students.  The material for this class is dull, but she makes it easy to get through.  She tells you exactly what will be on her tests, and the assignments are easy to get through.  Highly reccommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2006<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a very good teacher talks kind of fast and only give one example for the problems in class.The tests were hard.If you are not a good studier I would not recommend this class.  Also, do not miss any classes because you will miss a lot of information. The good thing is she lets out early majority of the time. Also she has a great personality.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: MGT315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the BEST teacher I've ever had a DePaul (and I'm not easily impressed).  She worries about her students and makes sure they understand the material.  Final was take home, and, while the material is hard, she makes is SUPER easy to understand.  I would definitely taker her again - super nice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2005<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TEST ARE SUPER HARD&gt; Mainly because they differ from what you learn. She is helpful and nice talks kind of fast though. I wouldn't reccommend unless you're a great studier since the tests are on tons of information all at once.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She may seem like the typical, &quot;Im here to help&quot; kind of teacher but dispite what you hear...she's aweful! She gives tones of work and teaches straight from Blackboard.  She rarely goes over the intense workload she gives and her tests are harder than you think. DON'T TAKE HER!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2005<br>Class Name: MGMT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is very nice, but very boring! she gives a lot of work..she needs to be a little more organized, but is always helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2004<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and pretty easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was a little unsure about her at first but she turned out to be a great professor.  The tests are a little difficult but she tells you what exactly is going to be on the test so if you know how to do those problems you should do very well.  She is a fairly easy grader as well. I say take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor is awesome. She makes class fun and easy. There is not a lot of homework compared to most classes. Gives class time. Everything in groups, cheat sheets, lets out early, and is very understanding. One of the best management profs! Take her you'll have fun, learn, and get a good grade!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so nice and helpful (young and pretty too!)You do homework in groups.

I recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2004<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice lady..a lot of homework but done in 4-5 people group..very flexible teacher..I had some personal problems--she was really understanding</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2004<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very sweet teacher.  She explains all consepts clearly.  Homework is done in groups, but I would recoment doing it yourself everytime.  Most of the test is based on math problems rather than vocab or concepts.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2004<br>Class Name: MNGMT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, but gives lots of homework, midterm long as hell but allows formula sheet.  study concepts, quizes r easy (from cd rom - book) and homework must be with group.  make sure you have reliable group members or your screwed.a little fast just keep with readings.  boring class, just takes from book</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
