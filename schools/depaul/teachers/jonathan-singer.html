You need to take extremely detailed notes. The class is easy, he gets off track often which makes it hard to know what you should be writing down. You only have 3 tests and a final for the entire course. He's very nice but repeats the same thing 10 different ways. He takes attendance also.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: 280<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>With 3 take-home tests and 1 take-home final, your grade is ultimately up to you and how hard you work on them. Tests are exactly like his lectures, which are detailed in class and also on D2L. I spent a few hours on each exam and got an A. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: PHL280<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He will grade his own tests against his own words. I recorded lectures and pulled exact quotes from what he mentioned in class yet I fail the tests. He's pretty outrageous. He will bring up ridiculous topics in class and go on and on about a topic that won't even appear on the test. He will engage students in useless debates making the class behind</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2014<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is extremely rude. I took very careful notes the entire term, yet on the exams says that his own words are wrong. said at the beginning of class we didn't need to take careful notes, yet grades you on every single word you type for exams. DO NOT TAKE HIM! He is extremely rude, and spends the entire class reading his own papers</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was probably the easiest class I have taken at DePaul. There were very few readings. I got well over 100% on each of the three take-home exams. EASY A. All you need to do is take notes during class. JD spends a lot of time trying to clarify information. He gets very into lectures and tries to keep students interested. Take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take notes and you will pass this class. He sometimes puts a ton of information into one sentence so it helps to record the lectures (he's totally cool with that). If you don't like raunchy humor, I suggest not taking this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Three take home tests. I got over 100% on each of them. Lectures are mandatory for a good grade because the tests are based solely on lectures. I wasn't looking forward to learning philosophy but J.D. made it very easy to understand and he answers questions pretty well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/24/2012<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the best instructor i had in DePaul so far. He is teching hard stuff in such a simple way that you just enjoy being in his classroom. I took him for two quarters so far, and planning to take some more of his classes. Take home exams are the only things that make your grade!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate Philosophy and Ethics, but I really enjoyed this class. 3 exams, all of which are take home make up the final grade, and that's it. He literally gives you the information about 10 different times in 10 different ways. No PowerPoints, so go to class. He's a really nice guy who wants you to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really interesting class, definitely taking him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He beat you over the head with the information basically.  He said everything multiple times.  I don't see how he has gotten so many bad reviews, he was more than clear; if anything, he was redundant.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He plays favorites.  If you want a class where you have to work so hard to just get a C or B then take him. But if you want a class where you actually understand whats going on.. dont take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2011<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class but if you take good notes you will do good.  Exams are take home.  He always reminds us of where he will be after class in case we need to meet with him and always returns e-mails in a timely manner.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He wouldn't meet with me after class.  He is not helpful at all.  He plays favorites.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a future teacher you learn that each student has a different way of learning.  Some orally, some by visualizations, some both, and some by doing hands on activities.  This professor has no understanding for this method.  He teaches orally. No visualizations to help clear confusing topics up.  Do not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>all exams and papers are take home, simple if you took notes during class. He is very repetitive which sometimes makes things confusing. he says it is but attendance not mandatory-- but come and take good notes to do well on tests</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>cross listed as phil 248.  Very passionate about philosophy.  repeats points several times because the concepts are hard for people to understand.  He is willing to meet with students to discuss after class.  great instructor who doesn't get the credit he deserves because people want an easy A.  You will work but you will learn good material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so passionate about Phil which makes him very enthusiastic and the class tolerable. I cannot imagine a dry teacher teaching dry material. Available for office hours. Only bad thing is like previously mentioned he repeats the same thing a lot of times. But I guess it gets the message across.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2011<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this professor is great! the two below me clearly have never taken or can handle a philosophy class. YES THE MATERIAL is dense and boring sometimes, but I feel JD does a decent job of at least trying to make his lectures engaging. id say he is a fair grader and is very willing to help students who are in need of assistance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very passionate about Philosophy and a nice guy but one of the most boring classes I've ever taken. Makes 2 points within the class and repeats them for the entire period. Uses words that are impossible to understand unless you have an extensive vocabulary. Also, he just stands in front of the class and reads from a packet he typed up.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2011<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>J.D. is very passionate about philosophy, which is appreciated but surprisingly unhelpful. He frequently makes points in class only to refute them moments later. 10 minutes are devoted to repeating rewording the same definition. Barely touched on the management aspect of this class. Lectures are very dull and the syllabus has been changed daily.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He tends to say that a definition means one thing and 5 minutes later will say it means another.  He is a very hard grader and will take points off for the smallest things.  If you do not write what he believes (and you may not know what he believes) it WILL be wrong.  Hes not boring though and he is a good speaker.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazingggg teacher! Cares so much about his students and will do anything to help you succeed. As long as you pay attention to each lecture its definitely easy to get a great grade! Take him!!!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
