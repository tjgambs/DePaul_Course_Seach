Was lucky to take anything with me from this class. She had us focus too much on a project for 4 weeks which had NOTHING to do with course material covered on exams!!! Be careful and if you must take her, study lecture closely! :</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2010<br>Class Name: CHE109<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>still teaching&#63; Really&#63;</div></div></div></body></html>
