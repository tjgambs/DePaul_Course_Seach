However, the course is not easy. She will, however, go out of her way to help you if you have any problems. She is VERY understanding, more so than many other professors. Take her course to LEARN!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2013<br>Class Name: RELC211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take a class with her, your grade would not reflect your performance but instead will only reflect her lack of ability to teach. She takes points off for things she didn't clearly explain and is very rarely on time to class. The content is not why the tests are hard, they are hard because ironically, she can't communicate. You've been warned</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE. horrible teacher. extremely boring and just likes to listen to her own voice. i did not learn anything, the tests are hard. not good at responding to e-mails. just dont put yourself through this class with her...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: CMN211<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests are hard if you don't study or use the study guides.
