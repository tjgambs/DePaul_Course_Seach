Basically all you need to show up to class, listen to her funny and relevant lectures, and do the minimal work required such as discussion board post. She made class interesting and really wanted students to succeed. 100% take her for any communication class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2014<br>Class Name: CMNS542<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor in DePaul's college of communication. She is a rarity as the rest of the department, save two or three professors, is the complete opposite of Dr. Murphy...take every class you can with her, it's not easy, but it's helpful and career-based</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2013<br>Class Name: CMNS541<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Communication Professor at DePaul.  Brilliant and sweet.  I recommend her to everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: CMNS541<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lexa was an excellent professor.  She was truly engaging and respectful of her learners.  She created a great environment for dialogue and furthered learning with interesting anecdotes and activities.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher. Participation and reading the book a must.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2011<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun teacher. Got students to become engaged.  The text readings were useful for the exam.  Make sure to take good notes.  There is an 8 page paper (for summer course) that you have to write on a movie.  It wasn't difficult to write just hard to reach the 8 page minimum without starting to sound boring or repetitive.  Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS541<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lexa is extremely well versed in her subject matter and enthusiastic about teaching.  She encourages learning and dialogue so the class ends up serving as the excellent foundation it is intended to be.  Grades on written assignments are tough and there is a log of work in CMNS 541.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2010<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice and sweet professor. Not always the most exciting topics but she still instills a sense of respect with her students. I wouldn't necessarily strive to take her class but there's no need to shy away from her class either.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS541<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lexa is great. Organizational communication was not my concentration area but she  opened my eyes to how corporate communication is structured. Assignments are relevant: four 3-4pg papers and a 15-20 pg. Lit review.  The only bad thing is that she can be a little late posting readings- that's tough for full time workers with limited free time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: CSS201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very sweet professor and extremely helpful. The course was very dry and too many readings. Hopefully you'll have her grade ur papers rather rather than locke. midterm was 2 papers and final 3 papers. the work in this class was too much for a scholarship i think</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's so nice and I thoroughly enjoyed her class.  Do take notes on key points that she makes, and read the book as the test is based on both her notes and the material in the book.  Participation will help with your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's one of the nicest professors I've ever had.  She's so sweet and her class is all about discussion and hands-on stuff.  Take her if you get the chance for your sophomore seminar</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had her for a couple of classes - always good and she is cute but someone you can respect. I don't think she looks like sarah jessica parker, though - much prettier and doubtless smarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2005<br>Class Name: MANY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is really down to earth and fun to talk to.  very smart and cute in my opinion.  i'd hang out with her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2005<br>Class Name: COMMUNICATION<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wouldn't kick her out of bed for eating crackers.   she is a great prof. as well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2005<br>Class Name: COMM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: CSS201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Lexa for Perspectives in Community Service.  Class was okay, she encourages class discussions entirely too much and let a few select people dominate the class.  Easy grader and not a lot of work, biggest drawback is the immense reading that was sometimes over my head.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2004<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, very easygoing and friendly; looks like Sarah Jessica Parker.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: ORGCOMM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I have had at DePaul..won't spoon feed you information and forces you to think..uses games to teach important concepts..very intelligent and sweet woman</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2004<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really sweet lady who knows her area very well, and knows how to make us think.
