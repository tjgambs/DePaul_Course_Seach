The reading she gives two times a week are lengthy and can take over an hour to read and sometimes can be difficult to understand, she goes over the basic information of each reading in class. Only a few papers and the midterm and final are easy if you attend class and read the assigned work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2015<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ryan is really passionate about what she teaches. The class was kind of difficult but if you put in the time you are meant to work outside of class, which isn't all that much, you won't have a hard time passing. Some of the readings were pretty dense and unclear but discussing them was always really helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2015<br>Class Name: MCS342<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>She is a good professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2013<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible class, she doesn't make sense. Makes you read lengthy dense essays. She also can't take the time to relate the stuff she teaches to real world examples. Took this class for a requirement and really kicking myself now. find a better professor.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
