She isn't helpful, and grades very subjectively. Her class feels like a complete waste of time, and she doesn't explain her grading scale.

ABORT ABORT.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do Not Take this lady.

I then spent 8 hours on the next paper in order to get a better grade, and received a B-. She doesn't tell you what she wants you to do at all. She's not helpful. She gives students that talk a lot in class A's and students that are more introverted low grades.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2008<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>okay, she is soooo easy...but she honestly has no will to be a teacher. she gives you a syllabus but never uses it, she doesnt really tell you what she wants in homework and essays, but if you dont do it then you can always give it to her the next day for full credit. if you want a class where you can sleep and pretend to do stuff...take her class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very laid back professor.
