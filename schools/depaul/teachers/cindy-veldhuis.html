She has poor teaching skills and is always defensive. I did well in the class, but only because I kissed up to her (because I saw from the beginning that was the only way to get a good grade). She has clear favorites and berates other people. Not a favorite of mine AT ALL.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: PSY317<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First of all, those five papers are NOT LONG.  They are not hard at all.  PSY 317 was one of the best classes I've taken, since I actually got some real life info out of it.  The teacher is really nice and as long as you participate she won't give you a bad grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2007<br>Class Name: PSY317<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>no test, no homework, but you have to write a total of five long essays and a really long final paper and presentation. she wants you to entertain her in your essays otherwise u will get a bad grade. paper five and the final paper is due within THREE days of each other. highly unorganized, biased and unprofessional</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
