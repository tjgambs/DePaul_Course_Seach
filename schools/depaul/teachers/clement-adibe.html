Doesn't teach or lecture at all just tells us to read. Super unorganized to the point where he had to extend the deadlines for everything that was due the first 2 weeks</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2014<br>Class Name: PSC254<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy has to be the worst teacher I've ever had. For an online class we bought 6 books and we read 100s of pages a week from the books and from random articles. So couple hundred pages a week from 4-5 diff books/articles. He has no lectures, is unclear, and expects students to keep up with a subject we have no experience without teaching us.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2012<br>Class Name: ABD254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE TAKEN! Very helpful if you show that you are interested in the topic. Expects you to read and participate in class. Requires each student to give a seminar so the second half of the quarter is mostly student taught. Have never learned so much in one class! Very passionate and always willing to help or just chat.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2011<br>Class Name: PSC254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXCEPTIONAL. Never have I had a professor so passionate about teaching and making sure his students succeed. Do the readings and COME TO CLASS (don't see why you'd skip anyway, the discussions are so engaging) and work hard, and you'll be okay.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2011<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never have I had a professor so passionate about the material that he brought himself to tears while laughing during his lecture. This man LOVES to teach. He expects you to work, but if you do, you'll get a good great and leave with a boat-load of knowledge.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2010<br>Class Name: STATE201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Getting an A in this class is really hard, I got a B- and I worked my tail off. Main grades are in class mid term and final, and the research paper. He at least tried to make things interesting and he was friendly in giving help. He does have an accent so sometimes it's hard to hear him. Not exactly avoidable but if you have him be prepared to work</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: PSC346<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult to understand sometimes and read handwriting.

He failed me on the midterm paper which was 20% of grade, gave me a 100 on reflection essay 25% of grade!&#63;! Ended up with a B somehow overall. Loved the class, hated him (or at least his inconsistent grading system).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2008<br>Class Name: PSC248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought the class was thought provoking. His opinions about America are very pessimistic but it does give you a different perspective towards the role America plays in this world. His accent isn't that hard to understand. He is very opinionated and somewhat cocky, but I did learn a great deal from him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2008<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man's sole objective is to ensure that each student knows that he's smarter than them.

This was easily the worst class that Ive taken at DePaul. He thinks the class is about his opinions. Utterly useless, and anything but inspiring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: PSC254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most useful, life changing experience.  The professor is amazing, the course was phenomenal. Adibe is one of the most intelligent individuals I have been taught by.  I wish he was teaching more.  Everything you learn is utilized to reflect on the world through your own eyes.  most unbiased, informative lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2008<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Give yourself a week or 2 to get used to his accent--but it's worth it; funny and smart.  The class seems a lot harder than it is--pretty easy grader.  A lot of reading, but you don't necessarily have to do all of it. A couple of papers and presentations, just try and don't act like an idiot and he'll like you.  VERY inspiring teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2007<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow. This man is incredibly smart and teaches very well. He gets you motivated and excited about the subject because of his style in lecture. Would have been better if the whole course were lectured by him rather than a large portion being covered by student run classes. very impressive professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart professor, makes you think about topics from various angles. Grades like an English Professor when it comes to papers. If you keep up with the material and follow along in class, you'll be fine</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Adibe is a great guy...his class was both thought-provoking and rigorous.  His exams weren't easy but if you read and critically evaulate what you've read you will be fine.  He has a reputation for being a tough grader.  The student presentations are the only complaint I have...I would've rather learned the material from him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2006<br>Class Name: PSC254<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Adibe is a very, very smart man.  However, I felt that the class was poorly structured and I did not feel that the second half of the class, which was all student presentations, really taught me anything.  I found the subject matter to be great, but I would have rather had Adibe teach it to me than some kid sitting next to me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof!  Very knowledgeable, but expects a lot from his students (lots of reading).  But he doesn't want anyone to fail so he is willing to help anyone as much as he can.  Take him if you can, but only if you're up for a challenge!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Adibe is great! His class is interesting and you learn a lot. But only take his class if you're up for a challenge because there are a lot of readings and he's a tough grader. Don't worry too much though, because he let us makeup our midterm if we disliked our grade and offered us the chance to resubmit our paper for a better grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, he is a very smart man and a great speaker.  However his prompts for writing papers and guidelines for tests are a complete mess.  He never gives you a clear objective, he just tells you to &quot;write about everything&quot; or &quot;reread all chapters.&quot;  He makes you waste so much time on things that really should not be complicated.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2005<br>Class Name: AFRICANPOLISCI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he definitely knows the subject matter, and he's a real stickler for turning in assignments when they're due, but you'll get a lot out of the class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2005<br>Class Name: PSC254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Adibe knows his****!  If you want a professor who knows about more than stupid, provincial, and inconsequential American politics, take this beautiful man's class.  You will learn about the world.  C'mon.

He is very laid back and tries to relate class to everyday life as much as possible. However, he is willing to work with his students. His exams are hard but do the reading (at least some) and go to class you can easily get a B. Read the class summaries online! Very Helpful!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: PSC254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared to work HARD! A's are not impossible but they are not to be expected. If you aren't afraid of spoiling your gpa, Prof. Adibe is an excellent professor. He will challenge even the best student. You will learn a lot from his class. WARNING:do not take him if you are shy or easily offended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSC254<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like to be insulted and don't mind a mean teacher you will be fine.  If you don't, you will have problems.  He is extremely unprofessional and just rude in general.

I've had him twice so far and i'd reccomend him to anyone. Yes he has an accent but it really isn't that unclear, also if something he says requires clarification he has NO problem obliging. He does ask a lot, but its worth it! He is funny and AMAZINGLY intelligent and knowledgeable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: PSC346<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hE IS VERY FUNNY AND DOWN TO EARTH.
