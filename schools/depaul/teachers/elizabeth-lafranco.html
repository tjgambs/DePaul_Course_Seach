Ital 101 was more simple talking...less reading/writing</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2007<br>Class Name: ITA111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is GREAT! She is really enthusiastic and makes the class interesting. She does speak only Italian throughout almost the entire class, but she makes it easy to understand. The only problems I had with this class were departmental issues, like the ridiculous attendance policy and the choice of textbooks-- none of which reflect on Elizabeth.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2007<br>Class Name: ITA111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is gorgeous as well as being really fun! She teaches the class with a lot of enthusiasm.  Even though the class is mostly spoken in Italian, she helps you whenever you need it to make sure you understand. TAKE THIS CLASS, it is great and I guarantee you will not be disappointed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2006<br>Class Name: ITA112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best ITA teacher ever.  It's a hard language to learn, but she makes it as easy as possible.  She speaks mostly in italian, but if your not getting it she'll explain it in english.  She is peppy and makes you comfy, she really gets into it and makes you get into it too.  She's approchable and friendly.  TAKE HER CLASS!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: ITAL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Liz is the best person in the world!  She almost feels like a cousin to me ;-)  If only, I, Ms. Bedia with the big fat coulie could have her.  Don't even try to bring her &quot;pizzeles&quot; b/c she's already has had the best kind and nobody's can top those.  By the way, I'm sure she's the hottest TA at DePaul hands down.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: ITA111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is awesome. She's younger (all the dudes thought she was hot) so she was able to catch the class' attention. If you need help, she's there. She's really peppy and just an all around groovy professor. She's the kind of prof you could go have a coffee with for kicks. Highly recommended!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
