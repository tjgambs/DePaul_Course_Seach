Confusing, doesn't teach you anything and doesn't even supplement the material well.  Lectures don't prepare you for any exam, and both are REALLY hard.  I wish I took a different professor because other PSY 242 students actually learned RM.  I re-read the book over break & took my own notes to learn it all. AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2006<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think that personally, John is a great guy, but professionally, he's not the best prof. Attendance wasn't required, he gave lots of extra credit for showing up, and the homework was simple. HOWEVER, the midterm and final had no relevance to what we talked about in class-which was pretty much everything but RM. He did curve the exams though...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2006<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Going to class and listening to him will not help you with the midterm or the final.  He talks about random stuff and even though reading is required (you BETTER read every chapter) he doesn't follow the same structure as the book so you're confused.  Then, the final is &quot;applied&quot; but he doesn't prepare you for it. Please do not take!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2006<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate this man with a passion.  If you want to be frustrated and confused for 10 weeks, take his class.  He was unclear and unfair, and I REALLY wish I had taken another professor. BOOOO!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
