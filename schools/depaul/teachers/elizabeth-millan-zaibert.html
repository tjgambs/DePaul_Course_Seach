She's a sweetheart. She really cares about students, and is pretty lax with deadlines. But she expects you to engage and write essays with actual substance. She's willing to help in and out of the classroom, but her lectures can be boring. She rambles and goes off topic a lot. But she's wonderful, I'd take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's honestly the best teacher ever. She is always helpful to people and really cares about people and their success. She always wants to make everything go smoother for you and very easy grader. Not a lot of readings and very understanding. I would def recommend her. She talks a lot though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2012<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a sweet woman. She genuinely wants everyone to succeed and she shows her passion for the subjects that she talks about. She tends to ramble a lot and her lectures can be boring, but it's not too bad. She's a pretty easy grader as well and values everyone's opinions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Millan is great. She's sweet and caring, and really wants to see her students succeed. Occasionally the entire class will be a lecture, but toward the middle of the semester the class picks up and is a lot of fun. She encourages discussion amongst students and will forgo lesson plans if a heated debate comes up in class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely amazing!

She is very reasonable and makes every class interesting. It is amazing to hear a person's train of thought; you don't get to see that very often. She always gets back on topic and I looked forward to class. I am so lucky to have had her as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2008<br>Class Name: PHL389<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>most flexible/laidback prof ever.

She is also very helpful. I learned a lot in her class, I wish I can take more classes with her. Her lectures are interesting and they encourage discussion.

Take her, she's awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a cool teacher, she tends to go on tangents and drags subjects longer than they need to, but she is very helpful and understanding. There is a decent amount of reading but you talk about in class and there are only two papers during the course. I recommend this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2004<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Millan is the best profesor I have ever had. She made me think of majoring in philosophy; if I could take all my courses with her I would. She is intelligent, funny, and beautiful; she will go out of her way to make sure you understand everything. Very fair and very kind... A MUST</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>friendly professor, laid back, Coolest professor your gonna find at DePaul.
