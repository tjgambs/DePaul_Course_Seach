I would have been pleased to earn a C in this class, but if you put in the work and try to your best ability you can definitely achieve a decent grade. She is also very understanding when it comes to emergencies and what not.  4 major essay assignments and a research paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2014<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class always felt entirely unnecessary; she really, really loves to talk. "The St. Martin's Handbook" and "They Say, I Say" aren't needed at all. She can be an irrationally tough grader on some essays, but essay rewrites are always an option. Overall not the worst professor I've had, but I wouldn't recommend taking her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you don't mind a professor who will talk at you for an hour and a half every other day and give you really minimal work (one 1-2 page paper per week), Susan Jacobs is fine. Her "lectures" are ineffective and sitting through her class is draining and absolutely boring but there is hardly any work attached to the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2014<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady, boring class. Reminiscent of a high school english course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2013<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although the class itself was not very interesting, I enjoyed having her as a professor.  The papers were pretty simple and understandable and criticism was helpful.  As a person she was nice and approachable.  Aside from being too talkative at times, she was a decent instructor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2012<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really passionate about what she does, however, to a point where if you are not passionate about what she likes, she simply hates you then. Grading is very subjective to the student, and she will grade your paper with comments that reflect that without remorse. "You're dumb, she's smart" type of thing. Avoid if you want to keep your sanity.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2012<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes not that great of teacher if you get on her bad side like i did. Attendance is important. Papers are graded with an iron fist, but always ask for help so you give her what she wants. No midterm or final. Class is very useful if your going into business or accounting. Great course, not such a great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2010<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you do not like writing papers. avoid. She is very techical and will critique everything. She is a wonderful teacher and is there to help, but the projects are a little difficult. If you want a class to skim, do not take hers. Buy the book, read the checklists.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman will talk her head off so bring ear plugs.  I sit there in amazement as she rambles about nothing for literally and hour and smiles while doing it.  Easy course though.  Text required.  Final paper is worth 60% of your grade!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2007<br>Class Name: WRG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really nice teacher paper assignments pretty simple she had like the last 3 the same paper topic just differenct structure like a proposal and such. she gives u a bunch of lab times and you never do any work really u get to discuss events in class and what u think about them its pretty easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a really nice teacher and she wants every one to do well.  She will help you if you need it and she is very clear on what she wants in the papers, however, I don't think she gives out any A's what so ever.  Don't show up late, go to class, and turn in your papers on time and you'll do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is very approachable, and an overall nice lady. Her grading system was a little weird, but I would still take her class again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: ENG301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you walk in class 2 minutes late just once, you will be on her**** list for the rest of the quarter.  Weird grading system.  Cold and disrespectful towards students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: ENG301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman should not be teaching because she does not know how to relate to students.  Don't ask for help becuase she doesn't want to take time out of her busy life to help.  Worst prof ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! Very hard grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jacobs is a very nice lady, she makes somewhat corny jokes that are funny. I think she is fair in her assignments, she doesnt ask too much and gives you a lot of class time to write papers or read.  However, I feel she isnt exacly clear on what you need to get an A on your papers. But she is willing to help you in anyway she can, in class or out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2005<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof.! I don't know how students think she's hard or how it is even possible to get anything lower than a B in that class. If you hand in your work, participate a bit, and show you'll do great in the class. She gives you plenty of class time to work on assignments and is always there to answer questions. On top of that, she's a very nice lady</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2005<br>Class Name: TECHWRITING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was scared to take the class when I first read the ratings. But I was surprised. She was very nice, never once said anything about tardiness, and was extremely helpful when you needed help. The projects were fairly fun and something you don't normally do. I would highly recommend her as a teacher. It was interesting to write in a technical manner</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2005<br>Class Name: TECHWRTITING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is by far one of the best teachers I have ever had.  She makes real world demands and expects you to not cheat your way through.  She is also very helpful with showing you how to look for jobs and internships. She def cares about her students who want to learn.  For all you kids who want the easy way out of life, go to a community college.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice lady! not that hard just have to do your papers well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What everyone says about her late policy is true, she is such a stickler about being on time, last time I checked I was paying her damn salary. Don't be late, add lots of detail to every assignment. Overall, I would never take her course she was teaching again, but the class isnt all that hard!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To be honest I thought this woman was a straight up **** because she did have some kind of attitude if you're late, I mean if you were one minute late it was an absence. She's not really helpful when you really need her, and she's a hard grader. That **** ended up giving me D.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a kindergarden teacher except she makes more money and isn't as fun. Don't EVER be late, she makes it seem like the end of the world. Write to please her not yourself, and if you like prof. who give you a topic to write about not a million things you need to answer she isn't the prof for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a loopy teacher. Her teaching methods are very elementary and her classes are quite boring, she talks about a BRAT of a son, a whole bunch. Whatever you do, don't be late, she acts like the time we waste comes out of her paycheck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a nice teacher but honestly this had to be the easiest class I've ever taken. It was to the point of boredom. She taught things we learned freshmen year in high school. If you want to have a class you can sleep through and get anA I recommend this class. But over all she's a really sweet lady</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2004<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i took her chicago book class. i liked her as a proffesor. she is very clear in what she wants and pretty ok grader. u can get by with doing most of the readings and she is understanding but don't be late to class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2004<br>Class Name: ENG301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was a pain in the ass, but she was a good teacher...clear on what she wanted.  not really a hard grader, if you do the assignments right.</div></div></div></body></html>
