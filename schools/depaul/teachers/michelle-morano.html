She was a bit wacky and definitely opinionated when telling her students how to write; however, she gave me a great deal of feedback that (hopefully!) helped me. The outside work was a little much and only somewhat furthered my overall understanding. Honestly don't know if I'd recommend her or not. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2009<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I have had at DePaul. I am an English student so I have been around the department and experienced much of the staff. Morano is extremely personable, interesting/interested in you, and makes an effort to get to know her students. I recommend her, as I will continue to take any course that she teaches!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2007<br>Class Name: ENGSECT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: ENG375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had her for fiction writing and travel writing, and she was wonderful in both. She seemed a bit spacey at first, but she's truly a knowledgeable writer who takes a lot of time to help her students. Her returned papers are always very thoroughly critiqued, she has a sense of a humor, and has a wonderful workshop format. A must-take for writers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2006<br>Class Name: TRAVELWRITING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class that increased a passion for writing.

She is very accessable and available to review and discuss your drafts. I really enjoyed the class. She has a passion for writing and her enthusiasm is contagious! She is very with grades and getting papers back. I hope that I have the opportunity to take another class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2005<br>Class Name: TRAVELWRITING<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: CMN291<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite professor at DePaul. Wonderful writer, very engaging and funny, gives amazing feedback. Took time out from her busy schedule to help me with a piece I was working on independently. Grades are hard to anticipate, but she does her best to let you know how you're doing until your final portfolio is graded. TAKE HER.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: INTRMFICTION<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Morano reminds me of Anne Lamott...extremely endearing and neurotic.  A great professor, and also a great person to be around.  She has great critiques on your writing.  Take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2005<br>Class Name: ENG409NONFICT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was excellent with everyone in class, no matter your writing skill.  She could have been clearer about how to revise or about the genre.  Overall, a pleasant class and she was concerned about your own perspective and writing improvement.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very insightful and has a nice way of telling you when your creative writing kinda' sucks.  haha. She points you in the right direction. Definitely recommend.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
