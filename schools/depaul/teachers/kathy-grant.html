Take her, but you won't learn anything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2005<br>Class Name: INDSTUDY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice and not only will she give you an A, but will write you an outstanding letter of rec.

If I were the NIH I wouldn't give her a dime!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2005<br>Class Name: CHILDPSY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Outstanding lecturer.
