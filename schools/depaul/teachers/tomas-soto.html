If you want to take this class wait for another teacher. I just hope that he doesn't get paid very well because he's horrible. I'm still trying to figure out what I learned in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: PSY363DRUGS<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was hard, and it probably didn't have to be. Slides are not enough to do well on the tests. There should be a pre-drug class before you take this one b/c the professor assumes you have a somewhat strong understanding of drugs, their official medical terms, what they consist of, etc.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2005<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst teacher i've ever had at depaul. i got a bad grade because the material on the test had nothing to do with class discussions, which were boring and a waste of time.  i thought the class was going to be very interesting...just wait until another prof teahces the course to take it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man's lectures are a waste of time. People in my class were either high or absent because we learned nothing from sitting there and listening to him talk about things we already know. Do yourself a favor, if you want to take PSY 363, wait for another professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2005<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is easy, just super boring! Read the book and print off all of the powerpoints and you'll do fine on the test.
