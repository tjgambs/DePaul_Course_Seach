Just talk to her!! she is there to help if you ask her. she challenges you but at the end of the day, it benefits you. the class is a little bit tough but this is Bio, Bio is not an easy class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2015<br>Class Name: BIO1932L1<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>She's the best biology teacher I've had. She gives a lot of great resources for you to do well of the exams. There are three exams and this class saved my science gpa. Great professor. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2015<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: WD</div><div id="right"><div>Awefullll, Horrible , Rude, Mean. Recommend to no one. Stay away from her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2014<br>Class Name: BIO193<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed her class. If you take the time to write down notes and read over them you will do fine. She would always review previous material before continuing on into lecture. She had a very good understanding on the material and graded fairly.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2014<br>Class Name: BIO193<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely awful teacher.  Goes much faster than the other section, her online study guides are garbage too because she teaches about half of everything on them, the rest is up to you to find in the book.  Take ANYONE ELSE</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: BIO193<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HER. She says she puts her PowerPoints online but they're always blank. She blows through the slides and if you ask her to go back she makes a fool of you in front of the class. In lab, she's ok, but terrible for lecture</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2014<br>Class Name: BIO120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>You are better off wearing ear plugs and copying the powerpoint. Doesn't matter if you understand the concepts cus quizzes are based on useless memorized facts from the lecture slides. She's there for herself, spouting off about concepts that the class doesn't understand, while making it hard to concentrate on the slides (which move too  quickly)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely intelligent, but just as hard to relate to on a personal level.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2014<br>Class Name: BIO120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bio major taking this class to satisfy the SI requirement. For 100 level, this class was way too in depth. Explains things way too quickly and the online powerpoints are blank. This class was "the science and art of vision" but dont be fooled by the title, it is 95% science and the art included is bland, just like the lectures. NOT a blowoff class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: BIO193<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm glad I ended up in her class because the material is straight forward and it's exactly what's on the test. Just take notes and review them very well and you'll do fine. Textbook is barely touched, but overall good teacher and you'll get a lot out of her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2011<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brilliant prof. Would put the powerpoints online before class so taking notes was super easy. I didn't have to open the textbook once and I got a B+, all from just paying attention in class. verythime I asked for help was extremely nice and clear. Will really try to explain things in different ways until you get it bc she gets its an intro class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2011<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures are extremely boring and her powerpoints are almost useless. Absolutely no handouts. You need to read the book and have a study group to get a decent grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2011<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think Dr. Wrobel was a great teacher.  Even though the class was large, she would always take time for any and all questions I had.  Even when it was to expound on a point she made, she could do it with ease, which showed how much she knew her stuff. I would and have recommended her, and my friends have had similar experiences.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2011<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not fun when she teaches. Reading off of powerpoints daily doesn't  help me learn.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2011<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really sweet, but just reads off powerpoints and doesn't connect her topics. It is very clear what she is saying in class, and you would be better off just going through the textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2011<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smart person with an amazing  background education but those can only get so far in teaching.  In a big lecture hall she has a more than difficult time connecting to the students and only reads off the power points that she moves through too quickly.  You are better off with the text book and online sources.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2010<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice, but doesn't explain the material very well. She just reads off the powerpoints she creates and goes too fast. You have to read the book to understand the material and study a lot. Listening to her talk and taking notes won't be enough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i don't recommend taking her class. she went too fast with her power points. she reads off the screen, its usless!yes she is sweet but not much help.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did not like Prof Wrobel. She was not a good lecture teacher. She would put all the information on a power point then talk while everyone was writing so fast from the power point before she would change it. So no one ever knew what she was talking about. She didn't go to college and get a degree to learn how to read a power point.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2010<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had Prof. Wrobel for both 101 lab and 103 lecture. I enjoyed learning from her in both. She is knowledgable, approachable and very committed to helping her students succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2010<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gives great study guides for the tests. Read the book to supplement your knowledge BEFORE class. Ppts have lots of writing and she goes fast so try to partner up with someone to make sure you get all the notes down. Sit in front because she is very quiet. Responds to emails promptly and will email you the ppt if you are sick-but don't take advantag</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2010<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wrobel is easy on the eyes guys.  But for real she really loves what she teaches and this quality helps you get into the class more.  Not to say its easy, you do have to work and study.  But hey its college, what do you expect&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2010<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wrobel is a sweetheart. She's really understanding about legitimate conflicts with lab. It's easy to zone out in lectures because her voice is soft and very quiet, but she is helpful and guinely loves what she teaches. Exams are not easy, but none of the professors for BIO 101-103 give easy exams, so you just have to study.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2010<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wrobel is very helpful and easy to talk to when your having a problem. She is very understanding. This class is not an easy class though. Unless you have an extensive background in biology your not going to make it without studying. Use all the study guides she provides and print out all lecture notes to follow along when taking notes in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for BIO 101 lecture and BIO 102 lab.  in lecture she was barely audible and unclear in the material. really boring. also, wrobel isn't very approachable or helpful when going to her outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2010<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div></div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
