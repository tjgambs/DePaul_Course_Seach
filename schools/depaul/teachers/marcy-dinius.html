She is awesome. The lectures feel so short, she picks short and interesting readings, and she hilarious as a lecturer. She doesn't hand out As you have to earn them, but its totally doable. She is more than happy to help you succeed! I would take her again in a second!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2015<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>She's very intelligent and super sweet. Funny most of the time too. Just a very very hard grader. Way too picky! Oh and there is quite a bit of reading and pop quizzes</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2014<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Dinius is amazing. Very passionate and aware of the issues with American literature (and the world in general). Had a great reading list and opened my eyes up to a lot of things. Her papers are tough, but she basically holds your hand through the entire thing. Reading quizzes are given weekly, but they're nothing if you did the reading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2014<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dinius is an honest to god, good teacher, of which there are not many these days. She is very smart and interesting and enjoys engaging with the class during lectures. If you do the reading, prepare for her to open your eyes and help you along the way. Would highly recommend her to any student. An excellent, excellent professor. Thank you!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
