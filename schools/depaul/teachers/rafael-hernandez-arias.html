Don't ever volunteer to work for him.  He turns into more psycho than he is for his classes.  He claims to do so much work but I had heard that he has not published anything since he came to depaul.  He is just like everyone else in this department.  I want my $100,000 back!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2008<br>Class Name: SOC382<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst teacher ever</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very unorganized. he makes sure you understand and will so anything to help. very boring and pointless class. just alot of busy work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2007<br>Class Name: SOC365<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>didnt hold my interest</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2007<br>Class Name: DADSDASD<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a really good teacher for me. I never thought a teacher could push me so far to do all the readings and stay focused in his class. Hard grader but is very understanding. Also if you take his class he is very ANAL about the readings! you MUST READ TO DO WELL IN HIS CLASS!** he likes to also call on people so if you are one that is shy tell hi</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2006<br>Class Name: SOC394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so unorganized.  He cares very much about the research but almost so much that it interferes with class.  Most of us had no clue what we were doing in the research project.  It took three classes to understand when it could have been said in 1 sentence.  He does care tho and he is such a nice guy.  He's helpful just a little confusing</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is different from other classes at DePaul. Professor Hernandez-Arias really cares about his work and the issues that he is researching. He is hard on you if you do not do the work. If you do work, the man really cares and encourages you to do your best. If you want to learn, to do something about real life issues, take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2006<br>Class Name: SOC350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Hernandez-Arias is different from other professors; he shays that he careas about you and he really means it!!

He really does get into some interesting issues later on. He also is very helpful to students and wants to see them succeed and will help you if you show interest to aid him in future projects</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: SOC350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unorganized, had no cluse what class was about until about sixth week in quater. Expects critcal thinking, but doesn't really teach.

Group project was ok, hard to trust two other people with your final grade. Great guy, extremely helpful if you ask him for anything he is there, which is important with the course being so intellectually demanding. I'd take it again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: SOC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher, clearly loves teaching and helping students - but wants people to take his class seriously, which is fair enough!  I learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2005<br>Class Name: SOC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Raf pushes you to make you think in ways that might seem 'unclear', but that is why he is challenging. he encourages independent, critical thinking.  so if you're into book reports and easy As, he isn't the right guy (and maybe you shouldnt be in college) well worth taking, very nice guy too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: SOC222<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY UNHELPFUL. I ended up dropping the class because he refused to help. We had a group project which NONE of my &quot;teammates&quot; communicated and he NEVER RESPONDS TO E-MAILS. Class was SOOOO disorganized. Supposed to be about health care and he's speaking like a F'N Zen master wannabe.  DO NOT TAKE!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2004<br>Class Name: SOC379<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof didn't make stats any easier or harder.his test are impossibly worded, gave little to no direction on the group project, lectures are confusing, but show up with the chapter read, interact in class and go to office hours he's very giving when it comes to final grades.DONT SKIP CLASS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2004<br>Class Name: STATS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not hard.  However, he is a terrible professor.  He is actually the worst teacher I have ever had.  He;s disorganized & unprepared.  I honestly cannot understand how he is employed by a University of any kind.  AND he complains about it to boot.  He should take what we can get.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>isp class.. hmm 2 papers, a quiz or two.

He loves a good class discussion, but is not very good at starting them up. Also, he tends to be unorganized... but an easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2004<br>Class Name: DSSW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So nice to talk to whether it is about school or personal issues</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2004<br>Class Name: SOC379<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is hard, but teacher is great.

But you do have to do a group project. Nice guy, but stats suck as it is. Don't be late to his class or he'll call you out in front of the room. Ask for help if needed!</div></div></div></body></html>
