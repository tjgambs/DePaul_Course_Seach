'Practice makes perfect' is what she says, but after practicing for the final 3 times people actually did worse then they did on the previous midtermproject. She's a joke & not worth your time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2014<br>Class Name: 301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher - great background and knowledge.

She is an awesome professor and has so much field experience. All her experience she uses to teach the class and it helps a lot! You need to go to class because test material is also based on class discussions and guest lectures. Make sure you are in a good group for the marketing plan. Wording on tests can be confusing sometimes</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady, class a bit dull at times since it was all off powerpoints. Preferred when she would just lecture instead of read off slides since she has a lot of experiene and many interesting examples to give! Overall nice lady, class was fine. I am not intrigued by Marketing but she did a good job to keep my interest.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher.  Very helpful and engaging.  If you have the chance definitely take this prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was Professor Rosenfeld's first quarter at DePaul and I thoroughly enjoyed her class! She explains all the material in an engaging way and gives real life examples for every concept. She also provides study guides for both the midterm and final, which is cumulative.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
