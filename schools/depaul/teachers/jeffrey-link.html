He focuses his whole class around music and assigns alot of h/w. 2 journals/week, readings arent mandatory and you dont discuss. research paper 7 pages. hard grader but a nice guy. If i had to take this class i would prolly look for a different teacher but he isnt bad. i just wasnt interested.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Link was very helpful and more than willing to stay after class and talk with you if you had questions.  It is primarily a writing course so you should expect to write.  I think he was a fair grader. His syllabus had everything spelled out- due dates assignments etc so it's your fault if you didn't do things. Take him, he is great!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS..This class is a 100 level class that has the expectations of a 300 level composition course. There are major assignments due every other class period and Link has a very stringent attendance policy. Not to mention he grades overly harsh, I am an experienced writer and he made it very difficult to get even a B in the course.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
