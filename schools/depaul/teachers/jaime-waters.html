Pretty straightforward. Lots of group work in class, but it's not too bad. No phones, she's serious about that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: CTH205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.

She's the best professor I ever had.  Her assignments are very clear and unique i told her i liked studying Luke, and she gave me an exam question on luke.  She is helpful and easy.  Not sure why the other reviewer called her Ms, because she is a doctor!  She makes me want to study the Bible and i'm not even religious!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2014<br>Class Name: CTH190<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Waters is a good professor, but majority of the assignments in this class were heavily weighted essay questions and one final paper. She is very unclear about what is expected in these writings, and grades pretty tough. It seems as though she is new to teaching, and has absolutely no idea how to assign and grade homework and essays.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2014<br>Class Name: CTH190<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good, fun professor.  She doesn't let computers or tablets in class, so DON'T BUY DIGITAL BOOKS and plan to write down notes.  It wasn't too bad without the computer because she gives powerpoints and handouts.  Fair grader. Overall great class!</div></div></div></body></html>
