Did not initially give an extension on an essay for a medical emergency. Had to argue with him for 10 minutes over it. I don't mind people's hair, but him twitching his head every 10 seconds to get his hair out of his face is obnoxious/distracting. Just of  few of the many flaws of this prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2007<br>Class Name: REL232<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>boo! im sure he's nice somewhere deep down inside. but he seemed like he didnt want to be there as much us. Kind of a hard grader. information is straight forward though</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: REL232<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof.  Bernard knows what he is talking about and if you pay attention and read, you will learn some!  His grading is seriously questionable and his attitude comes off smug!  Might do the reading, or as much as you can and be interested in class, but with him- might not be enough!  He is intimidating and you sign in + out  of class!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2006<br>Class Name: REL232<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems nice but he is an ass. Dont take it, if you have to.. wait till next quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: ANCIENTISRAEL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard, not clear, not recomended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: ANCIENTISRAEL<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked this professor.  I think he is very clear with things, and will help you understand anything you don't understand.  His midterm was somewhat hard, just because you didn't really know what to study, but other than that I really enjoyed the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2005<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof was fun, although a difficult grader.  I enjoyed this class a lot.  He is a cute guy, too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: CTH213<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, does he actually read the stuff that he assigns for class. Multiple times during class he acted like he never read the book reading that he assigns. Also, HIS GRADING IS ATROCIOUS. He in the only prof I have ever taken where a B is a great grade. Whatever you can do, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2005<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2005<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I do not recommend this professor. We turned in our finals on July 20 and we still have not received our grades as of August 2. Grades were due July 29 but promised a week ago. He also made excuses for not having our MidTerms graded and we did not receive them until the last day of class (and then he forgot a few of the students' papers at home).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2005<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Though a new professor, I do not see him being any better in the future. He seems to think highly of himself.  His assignments can be confusing, only because you do not know what exactly he wants out of them. Difficult grader. I would recommend you do not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2005<br>Class Name: NEWTEST213<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the guy sucks.  i did fine in the class, but did not like him, and its safe to say the entire class did not like him.  it was his first class, but i dont see him getting better anytime soon.  Took the class because i had to, but am glad its over</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
