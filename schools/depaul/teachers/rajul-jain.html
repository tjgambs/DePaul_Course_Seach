She cares so much about her students and genuinely wants to see them succeed. She rarely lectures for more than 45 min We always had activities every class. The class goes by so fast. She spends so much time just giving you advice about your future career She's hilarious and the homework is simple and fun</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD255<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mandatory attendance but professor read from the PPT slides the majority of the time, so I often felt there was no point of me coming to class. Tests were difficult, but in the end she curved the first two because of extremely low class average. I didn't particularly enjoy this class. Extra credit was given, though, which was nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD391<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rough accent, but extremely nice.
