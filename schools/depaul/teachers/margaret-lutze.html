Her study guides are just vocab which made me study definitions. Some definitions do not have function attached to them but you better know function - so the study guides are deceptive. Some things on the test - not talked about at length in class. Lectures are so boring - some surfed the net during class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2014<br>Class Name: BIO126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful woman. Cares about her students. However she does say that you do not have to show up to class and that it will not count in your grade -- which is true. But go to class if you want to get a higher grade on the exams. Most of the questions are things she says in class and are NOT in the textbook. Study hard for the exams,focus on details.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2014<br>Class Name: BIO126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS, I went into this optimistic about the subject and professor based on what I had read on here, her lectures could not be more boring. The entire class is 50% midterm and 50% final. She gives you a "study guide" and teaches you none of the information.  Absolutely the WORST class I have taken, such a waste of time and money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2014<br>Class Name: BIO126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Professor Lutze! She really knows how to engage her class and teach in a way that keeps you thinking. I'm one year out of her class and I keep thinking about topics such as monism/dualism that she covered in class, and how relevant they are in everyday life. Take notes, show up, do the reading, and you will pass. You do have to study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2013<br>Class Name: BIO126702<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST Professor at DePaul, hands down. She teaches COLLEGE.. period! She doesnt care if you come to class or learns, she gives you the work and you do it if you want to. I hate professors that babysit you and makes you participate. She is not like that, she is fair and a great professor! 2 thumbs up!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2011<br>Class Name: BIO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT PROFESSOR.  not only an easy professor but she is also understanding and knowledgeable.  talk to her she will help you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2011<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can do jack in this class and beg for the grade you desire. I have seen it done first hand. If you do all the work that is givin to you and try as hard as you can, you will get a lower grade then desired. Trust me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2011<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible class! It is nothing but a terminology class in witch you must learn everything she teaches exactly as she said. If you take very good notes you will not fail. But the total grade for the class is between the Midterm and the Final and many of the questions are trick questions. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2010<br>Class Name: BIO239<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is  science for non-science majors class. She is quite boring in lectures, but as long as you take notes you will do fine on the exams. There is an end of the year project that you do whatever you want. You will always get out early, labs are CRAZY EASY.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2010<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an extremely nice lady and always willing to help her students. She understands that this is an intro course so she grades easily and fairly. Absolutely no HW which is nice. Just 3 tests. The class is a bit boring, but it's not her fault. It's just the class in general. Def take if you need the class for credit! Good prof!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2008<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice lady and very easy class.  If you go to class it's impossible to to get a good grade.  Just take notes and that's it.  Three tests and no HW.  Don't bother buying the text though, you don't use it and it's $$.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2008<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very sweet teacher. people said she was boring but i thought some of her stories were interesting and pertained to wat she taught. no quizes or hw just  three tests based on wat she says in class for the most part.  very very nice teacher i would def. take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, this woman is QUITE boring, but honestly, I don't really mind cause its not that difficult of a course. She tends to ramble, so bring your laptops and surf the net while you take notes. notes are VERY important, all of her tests are based off of them. I didn't even buy the book once and I got an A- on my 1st exam. also, no homework AT ALL. :-)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was pretty easy, but you must come to class and take notes, because most of her tests are note-based.  you barely have to read at all or do any homework.  but she's amazingly boring. it could be worse</div></div></div></body></html>
