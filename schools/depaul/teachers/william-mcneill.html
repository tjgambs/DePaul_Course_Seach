He's a great person, and he helps his students develop their interest in philosophy with such humility and encouragement. If you're interested in philosophy, you should give McNeill a shot, he might change the way you see life. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2015<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely fantastic at discussions. He really knows how to deflect answers and redirect them to the viewpoint of the philosopher at hand. As for any professor, you should be prepared for his class, but his essays were fairly easy. Do the readings, get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2015<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's so helpful! I highly suggest e-mailing him questions about the papers you must do. He's making me consider a philosophy major, and I will be taking his classes in the future!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is great if you want to dedicate your life to philosophy. Unless you have a prior advanced comprehension of the readings, this class is near impossible. The professor will shoot every new idea that you have down with complete arrogance and zero regard for you. Would never force my worst enemy to take this class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>This class was pretty interesting even though the lectures could get lengthy, but the grading of the weekly quizzes was absurd. There's no other way to describe the way it was graded then that it was trying to prevent you from getting a good grade on it. It's a challenging class but if you do the readings and go to class you should pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2014<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent material, great intro to Philosophy as an Honors credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2014<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor McNeill is an awful professor. He gives quizzes every Thursday that contain unanswerable questions. You have to write three six page philosophical essays throughout the quarter that are entirely dependent on whether or not he adequately taught the material. Professor McNeill dodges questions and often restates questions as answers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2013<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was very excited to take a philosophy class since I had an interest prior to this class, but I know that my classmates that had no prior exposure to philosophy now hate it. Very boring lectures, does not explain things well, and would get critical when I would speak up with questions or opposing views. Should not be teaching philosophy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2013<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Like Prof. McNeil says, this class will teach you how to die. He gets depressing at times but overall creates and answers many existensial questions through the eyes of various philosophers. Class can boring with such long lectures sometimes. Don't be alarmed at the pre reading, the class is not that hard and he gives a lot of easy extra credit</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: PHL373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor McNeil is great! The material covered is pretty difficult but his lectures really help you understand what is going on. Very open to meet with students which helped me a lot. There is a lot of comprehension required but he is very approachable. 2 papers with well written critiques with ways to improve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: PHL390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>McNeil is a brilliant professor that encourages discussion and questions in class. He does an excellent job at explaining material and is concerned with his students comprehension of it. He is exceptional at relating continental philosophy to ancient philosophy. He specializes in Aristotle and Heidegger.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2011<br>Class Name: PHL367<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>McNeill encourages discussion and free thinking. Does not impose his views upon the students, but will share them if pressed. Helpful outside of class, and a fair grader. Expert in Greek and Continental Philosophy, particularly Aristotle and Heidegger. Not the most interesting Instructor but  you will learn a considerable amount.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2010<br>Class Name: PHI242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>5 short papers - 1 presentation --- that's it folks. He makes the most challenging philosophers cake. He allows freedom of thought and opposing points of view on philosophers. I?d take his class again just to hear that accent? Not bad to look at either...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2009<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh, Dr. McNeill... He's a good teacher, and philosophy's an interesting subject. The material was pretty mind blowing, but he was very helpful, understanding, and encouraged class discussion. Plus he has that awesome and soothing British accent. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2006<br>Class Name: PHL293<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You pretty much just discuss the readings in class.  there is no real work besides one project and a final paper.  the only problem is that you almost have no clue what you are going to get in the class until you see your grade at the end of the quarter but the class is worth the dicussions regardless.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: BEINGANDTIME<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The man is brilliant. I made the mistake of taking this 300 level class when I was a Freshman, so I was lost most of the time. However, he was kind to me concerning my papers. Should have had a mid to low C, but ended up with a B, then a B+. Can't wait to take him again now that I know what the hell is going on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Is a very kind, understanding teacher. Class is boring, but if you take good notes you will be find. Grade is based on one midterm paper and the final paper so take REALLY good notes, then you can just copy them for the papers. Take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not too much reading to do and only two essays, so the course is easy. However, it's difficult to concentrate in such a big class. I've heard friends say that they had him for honors classes and really enjoyed it so go for a smaller class if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love philosophy but this guy made it dull for me.  The earth will perish because of his boredom. I enjoyed studying the subject matter but nothing exciting about the professor. The class does require  some work and his grading style isn't quite clear. Philosophy courses're fun, just remember to pick another professor because this one'll bore you</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A nice guy. Easy A. Sometimes he is boring</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2005<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Depressing in a funny way. Easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2005<br>Class Name: PHL325<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>McNeil know's Heidegger, my god does he ever.  I do think you have to go out of your way to broke down the iceberg, but once you do -- it's payout time.  You will get the information you are looking for.    I would highly recommend him if you are a philosophy major.  I imagine he finds his PHL 100 classes a bit tedious so he may be grumpy there.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy but VERY boring. Not very interesting and requires A LOT of writing, but its simple writing. Quiz every Thursday and some are pretty damn tricky.  Don't expect to have fun, but look on the bright side. no midterm, no final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2004<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not bad prof. Readings optional goes over everything in class next day.  Sit in front so you can hear him better and he rarely puts people in front on the spot.  Any troubles, chat it up after class.  Seems unapproachable, but really isn't.  Assignments easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall a pretty good teacher.  If your not interested in phil. you can get bored very easily.  The class is not too hard with weekly journal entries (2-3pgs) and a weekly quiz.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2004<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid this prof at all costs! Doesn't like to be questioned and doesn't seem to like Western society. He also gets pleasure from belittling his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher. As long as you participate in class and keep up with the readings you'll be fine. There is no midterm or final. There are 4 quizes and then a journal entry for all the readings you do. The class is very interesting!</div></div></div></body></html>
