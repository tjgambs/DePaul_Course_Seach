She has readings posted online and we discuss them in class. Follow the syllabus to the t and you shall succeed. She is very helpful if you seek help. I enjoyed her class very much. Those who do poorly are at fault because the resources and guidelines are there for you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2010<br>Class Name: PHL380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took McAuliffe for feminist philosophies. She's a good teacher. The readings are long and can be boring but make sure you do them. The writing assignments aren't that difficult and she helps those who seek to help themselves.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2010<br>Class Name: PHL211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am a straight A student and have no problems with any of my professors thus far at DePaul except McAuliffe. She's unclear, boring, and plays favorites majorly. Theres a group presentation for the entirety of each class, journals, and 2 5-7 page papers.  Whatever you do don't take her.  She sucks.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2010<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor.  She's fake nice. She is extremely biased, close-minded, lazy, and unhelpful.  Every class is taught by students.She does no work.The readings she assigns are erraneous, boring, long, and often are published by obscure companies because they lack credibility.  DO NOT TAKE HER!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is definitely super nice and easy going. There are no tests but very heavily dependent upon papers. I prefer that though because you get to control the grade you get, rather than being screwed over by having a test, and I am not good at philosophy anyways and I'll probably get a B. Overall if you need to take this class, take it with her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2007<br>Class Name: PHLPHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor, explains with clarity, just uses e-reserve texts. Very interesting, uses dialogue every class.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
