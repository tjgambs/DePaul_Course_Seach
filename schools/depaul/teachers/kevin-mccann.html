The class was easier than I would have preferred, given the importance of the field, but still good student behavior expectations</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor McCann is very clear and follows the syllabus to a T. Attendance is mandatory and make sure to dress professionally while completing observation hours. He will go over the midterm and final beforehand so take notes! Also, he is very helpful outside class so be sure to ask him for help if you need any :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: TL404<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really is a wealth of information.  He was very understanding when I missed class, as long as I told him in advance.  He also always accepts late assignments.  He is such a jolly man, always willing to help, and has GREAT info and connections.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2009<br>Class Name: TL404<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. McCann is an egomaniac that is most interested in talking about himself during class. Yes, he has a lot of &quot;connections&quot; which is helpful when trying to complete observation hours but he is also a perfect example of how not to teach. Lots of stupid videos outlining exactly what you have already been forced to read and summarize. Total waste.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the best prof ever!!! this class is set up to open all e.ed major's eyes to reality. either you want to teach or not by the end of this course. the prof is funny and he really loves all things to do with education..plus he has connections :)~</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
