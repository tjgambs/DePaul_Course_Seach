Way too much work for a Focal Point class. Lots of boring readings and assignments. Lectures are only interesting if people actually participate. He is very opinionated and does not like when people disagree. He comes across as being very condescending. Class was sort of interesting, but I wouldn't take it again and don't recommend it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2013<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice and brilliant man, with a great deal of passion about his subjects. He expects college quality work, as he should. He doesn't lecture all day and expects students to discuss readings and employ critical thinking and creativity. Very nice outside of class, easy to contact with questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very condescending and very vague when it comes to assignments.

I did not feel like I got a lot out of his class and he was not very clear as to what he wanted in assignments.

He relies a lot on the book and makes you teach yourself. also the final was ridiculous, poor guidelines. dont pick him unless youre really interested and you dont mind a ton of homework</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take Comics & Culture. He does not know how to lecture & initiate discussion. The class can be very boring & he gives you a 5 minute break for a 3 hour class. The class meets once a week but there is too much work. The due dates are too close together. Its the 7th week & he still has not given us an estimate as to what my grade is. Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SO BORING. The hour and a half never ended. I learned nothing in this class, waste of time and money.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do the reading. He'll make you write responses to the readings, but then he'll say that he doesn't care if you keep the responses or not. Emphasis on portfolios. Class sucks - don't take this teacher. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate writing but he made this class so easy. Three papers that are eventually put together for one final paper. Always helping you out & each paper goes through at least 3 drafts before it's graded. I recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this professor. Arrogent. Little interest in teaching. Unclear directions. Pressure on students to write about subjects that he wants. Does not teach. Save yourself the trouble. DO NOT take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I've ever had in my entire life. He's ignorant, arrogant, and most of all, socially inept at relating to students. It's as if he's teaching a class on synergy or C++. He's so dry and can never finish a sentence without switching his words out as if he needs to have the perfect sentence every time he speaks. I would never recommend him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he was alright. not really clear with assignments but generally easy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very nice and tries to keep the class active in discussions. If you do the readings you should do fine on all of the papers - usually they pertain to a reading or two. He is a fair grader and tries to help out with our writing process. Overall a good teacher, but class does get pretty boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretentious and hard to follow because he's so intelligent. It's hard to keep up with his ideas. Make sure you have time to study and really keep up with the work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2009<br>Class Name: MULTIPLE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bit of a quirky man, definitely unexpected interests when you first meet him. But he's funny and nice and tries his hardest to engage the class. He tends to go off on tangents, but eventually gets back on track. He's very open to new ideas for papers and helps brainstorm if you're unsure of what to write. Pretty easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2009<br>Class Name: ISP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Winslade is a very good teacher. He is fun and helpful. I really enjoyed my focal Point class with him. The only thing is that his organization of information is all over the place. Reading wasn't really clinged too. He was also opened to new ideas and concepts. I'd recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A really cool guy. He doesn't like having to repeat himself, so make sure you pay attention. Good sense of humor as long as you like sarcasm, but sometimes he tries too hard to be cool. We got to do assignments based off the Daily Show and Sufjan Stevens, which was pretty fun. I really recommend the class. DO THE ASSIGNED READING.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2009<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this Prof Winslade for freshman seminar: Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He has an obvious and inspiring passion for the topic. Even classmates who had never seen the show before really enjoyed the class. Class includes analyzing episodes, weekly journals, midterm and final papers, and one group project. Prof Winslade is a great instructor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I always struggled with English so I won't blame the professor. Overall he is okay. He can actually  be funny. Sometimes the class gets really boring but I guess it's the fault of the subject not the professor since the other classes he teaches (i.e focal point) are extremely interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a cool guy who loves to talk with his students. He gives a decent amount of work, which really helps, and he doesn't give tests either. He also provides helpful feedback. I would recommend Professor Winslade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He likes when people come to class. Hes entertaining and like to tell stories. Weekly writing and nightly reading. Wasn't too difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you take him for irish myth be ready for a lot of modern politics. A little lacking, the class was unmotivated. Nice guy, but a little pompous sometimes. I was suprised i didnt get an A with the quality of work I did. Not a bad teacher, dont avoid but dont go out of your way. He would have been more fun to have had a beer with than be taught by.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome class. yay for occultism!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>professor winslade was very helpful and would do anything to help students get good grades. he is so nice and if he doesn't have anything to say in class, he'll let you go early.  he is really easy to relate to.  highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He basically implied his 103 classes were blow off classes compared to 104. We had to pick one topic and write about it for the remainder of the quarter. Make sure you pick a good one, or else you're screwed. Have fun! He's nice, but that has no relevance to the class. I worked so hard and my class avg. isnt even an A-. DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR 104!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Winslade is very helpful. In fact, he makes sure every student meets with him once outside of class. He was a pretty easy grader too. I got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him last quarter, but the more I see him the more attracted to him I am... it's weird.. he has an aura of just being this really cool attractive nice guy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Winslade is a young guy, which makes him that much easier to talk to. He incorporates fun, interesting things into class and treats the entire class as his equals rather than students &quot;under&quot; him. No tests, just papers: nothing hard, and you'll always get to choose an interesting topic. Take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Winslade won't come drink at your house, but he'd do much anything else - a cool guy stuck with some****ty curriculum, until he gets his PH.d.  I recommend him if you have to bite on the writing comp requirements.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He kind of treated my like a science experiment because i was unwilling to show him my papers, but hes a very cool guy, we talk all the time about the 80's hes fun</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: ISPSOMETHING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool guy, kinda artsy.  Very animated in his lectures, and likes to incoporate different media (videos, etc).  I really enjoyed the class, and he picked some great reads for the course. Just show up and if you do the reading, you'll be fine.  Fairly easy quizzes, paper wasn't bad.  I came to class hungover most of the time and I still got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WEIRDO....he is a WEIRDO...

It was alright, I wouldn't take another of his topic unless it would be a different class. I took Occultism and it was not interesting.

He is very intelligent and helpful. A little odd/disgruntled at times. Don't get frustrated if he marks all over your paper(s) - his comments are well worth it. Read your required and recommended material BEFORE class and you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST teacher I have had at Depaul. fast grader, very leniant and clear about his expectations. just do the work.

He is very responsible, grades things very quickly, and is lenient.  Very reasonable man, easy to get along with.  He's really smart and knows his stuff but never makes his students feel dumb. He's a pretty easy prof too.  I would take another class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class....he is not that hard of a grader and there are 2 major papers and a final.  he's a nice man and very inderstanding about late papers and missing class-just make sure you write him an e-mail.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2004<br>Class Name: OCCLIT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor, one of my favorites.

In my 3 years at Depaul he is the worst I have ever had!  He gave me an A and I would have taken an F just to not have had to sit through his class.  He calls on people at random and makes you feel dumb! Arrogant!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him if you want to just sit there and listen to him talk. His grading system is good. Let's you revise paper by peers, than he does it, than you give in a final revision that he grades.
