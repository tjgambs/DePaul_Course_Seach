I never planned on majoring in accounting but after taking his class I changed my major. He gives out weekly quizzes which are not difficult if you study the practice problems. Incorporates his knowledge from working at Sara Lee/Kraft into the material. Take him if you have the chance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor, made me want to major in accounting and puts passion into what he is doing. Just do the practice the problems he gives you and try and you should do well. Took accounting first time got D, took it again and he gave me motivation to learn and got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2012<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very good!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Every week quiz, middle term and final. work for sarah lee, back depaul teach night class. go to the class and you won't be disappoint. Take him, you will learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One BIG thing I learned from this class&#63; P.Marcy works for Sara Lee! He drills that into your head more than Acc info. He's a decent teacher. Pointless to go to his after class reviews for midterm/final. About school policy and making up test, he doesn't know a thing! I had an excuse for my exam and he made me go thru Deans office! Dont miss a test</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice friendly teacher, will do anything to help. Loves Sarah Lee and teaches concepts NOT memorization. His in class quizzes can be tricky, but most of the grade is final/midterm. He is very passionate about accounting and not boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Adjunct Professor, gives back to DePaul by teaching night classes and works at Sara Lee normally. He is good, he will not teach you to memorize but to actually learn and conceptualize material. Does a lot of problems in class to assure students abilities for test. Just make sure that teaching style is for you before signing up.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2009<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE HIM!!! Stop reading the ratings and go to sign up before the class is full. You'll learn A LOT because most of the class time you spend going through problems as a group. Midterm, final, and four quizzes are all very similar to the problems you go over in class. If you aren't shy and ask questions he makes sure you understand the material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best of the best! Prof. Marcy is such a sweet guy and can teach. Acc 101 can be a drag, esp for a night class...but you will get a lot out of it. He goes over a bunch of problems, which is going to help you with the midterm and final. If you need a passing grade in accounting, TAKE HIM!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Marcy is an awesome professor. I learn ANYTHiNG in my accounting class in high school. I learned a lot from this class && if you just practice or dedicate a whole day to accounting once a week you'll do fine and pass. His handouts are really helpful for lab and studying. Take Him! You won't regret it for sure : )</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: ACC01<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the easiest class in my life. just show up and pay attention and you will pass. does not collect homwork or attendance but is beneficial to be in class that way you dont have to read the book</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE THIS PROF.

This is the best prof i have had in my 8 quarters at DePaul.  Extremely helpful & has a genuine care for his students. Goes above & beyond to make sure each person is doing the best they can & is extremely encouraging of every student.He is an accountant for Sara Lee & teaches to &quot;give back to DePaul&quot; which shows the type of person he is.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: ACC10<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE IS THE MAN.  Marcy is an awesome professor.  He explains everything twice and does a billion class problem that are helpful.  He talks a lot about Sara Lee (he works there) and loves his white shirts, but other than he is a great guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You would be hard-pressed to find a more dedicated professor than Marcy. His distinguishing features include his enthusiasm and  positive attitude. When you don't do so well on a quiz, you feel like you let him down. That's how encouraging he is.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such a great guy, not a typical professor..he actually works as an accountant, so he knows how it is in the real world,he doesnt just teach by the book. class consists of 7 quizzes,he drops the lowest 2, midterm and final. he does a lot of problems and explaining in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the best teacher I have ever had.
