Laid back & approachable. One of the best teachers Ive ever had. Makes class a pleasant experience. Keeps things interesting. Gets straight to the point of the material.

He's nice, easy going, has a sense of humor.  I didn't love his class.  I struggled with some of the values being taught in our text and he was unable to verify if they were archaic or relevant.  It was like he just didn't know what to say.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2004<br>Class Name: REL223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher and a great guy. nice and informal teaching style full of humor and fun. highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2004<br>Class Name: INTROBUDH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is great!!!!
