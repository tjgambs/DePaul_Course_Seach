Interesting topics discussed during the lectures. Professor Quinn is super laid back and really helpful. I'm glad I took him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2015<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Took him during the summer and it was a lot of work because of the film screenings, but it wasn't too bad. Only bad thing was that he uses Prezis, which I personally do not like.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2015<br>Class Name: DC301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Matt was a great teacher for advanced screenwriting. Between being a professional script reader and being a writer himself, it was a big help.  Very down to earth and knowledgeable about the industry, he's also willing to bounce ideas around with you if you're stuck or have a block. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2015<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Quinn was by far my favorite teacher at DePaul. He has an awesome knowledge of movies (especially horror) and is really funny. He gives great feedback and does not ask too much of students. Very straight forward. Fun class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: DC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would definitely recommend him as a teacher. I went into this class not thinking of myself as a screenwriter but now I most definitely do. He seems to genuinely care about you and your work and is willing to help and toss around ideas. I will also mention he is a blue eyed Zach Efron;)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2014<br>Class Name: DC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class as a freshman with a concentration in screenwriting and it didn't disappoint.  I'm pretty sure he said at the beginning this was his first time teaching a writing level this low, so I was wary, but it was a great experience.  Very knowledgeable and will give you the positives and the negatives on your assignment.  Great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2014<br>Class Name: DC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher that in Depaul. He is willing to give you feedback, or even teach you after the class. I recommend if he teach every class that you need, you shall take him. He is awesome teacher you will learn a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2013<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The screenwriting class isn't particularly difficult but it requires time and effort. The online version of this class was easy to follow and his lectures were engaging.  I really enjoyed this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: DC301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quinn = great example of  what the DC dept needs to compete with the coast schools. Highly effective instructor, a professional script reader on the side and a screenwriter himself with at least one sale/option under his belt --- Offers insightful comments. Grades fairly w/ clear expectations. Demonstrates deep understanding of the craft.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
