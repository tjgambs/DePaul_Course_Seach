He is also very generous with his time and is very willing to help you out if you need it but you must be proactive! If you don't go to class you definitely won't pass. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2014<br>Class Name: MUS102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor.  You learn how to make music that you have never knew about before.  Very wonderful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2014<br>Class Name: MUS107<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Music Theory is hard, but it becomes easier and easier when you take it with him. Take it with him, or you'll miss out.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: MUS107<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>MUS 107 is not necessarily an easy course, but you are absolutely missing out if you are a music non-major and you want to get your feet wet with theory. Prof. K. is a guy who cares more about you learning music in the way you want to than about giving you a grade. Put your best foot forward and he does the same. He is highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: MUS107<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This course is a little more advanced than some of the other comments make it sound and I wouldn't recommend it if you don't have some experience composing/playing music. That said he is very passionate about music and extremely approachable and understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2012<br>Class Name: MUS107<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. K is a very kind teacher.  He is always encouraging to students and I feel I learned valuable things from this class.  He isn't always 100% clear, so it's helpful to ask any questions you might have about what he expects on assignments.  The one test you have to take in the class is only 10% of your grade.  Fun class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: MUS102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of the best teachers period. If you do the 4 mandatory assignments you are almost guaranteed an A in the class. Super laid back, and impossible to think of a bad quality in Prof. K... Take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2012<br>Class Name: MUS102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of the easiest classes I've ever taken. Almost everyday we optionally take turns sharing our music that we've either created or just find interesting. Final days consist of classmate concerts. Final proj is a musical product of any form. Def recommend for Arts&Liq req and just a fun easy class. Attendance policy super lenient.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2011<br>Class Name: MUSIC107<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is supposed to be an intro course but it's actually pretty advance. But the professor is very helpful and grades super easy. Rent, don't buy the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2011<br>Class Name: MUS102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jeff is awesome! He is passionate about music and always has something interesting to talk about or play for you. The class is fitting for anyone who is interested in writing music, but complete beginners will have NO problem getting an A. Class was full of students all with an interest in music and frequent feedback will be given on your music.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: MUS107<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was great, and Jeff couldn't have been a better instructor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: MUS107<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class not knowing anything about music what so ever, but still got an A.  A ton of information that I'ld never heard of and had no clue what It meant.  He's super nice and is an easy grader, homework and a final project only, but he's extremely easy on everything</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2008<br>Class Name: MUS107<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is ridiculously easy, but he is one of the nicest professors ever. He is ALWAYS willing to help and grades more on effort and improvement than actual talent. I would certainly recommend him to people.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2008<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EASY A!! Don't even have to go to friday classes just turn in your work. If you want to actually learn how to read music then don't come here, but hes generally interesting and it's an laid back class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: MUS102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice professor but an ass about attendance... got 100% one every activity/paper/project and still ended up with a b- in the class cuz of attendance</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: MUS102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is great! I absolutely love him. Class is really easy. It is helpful if you have a grasp of music, but that isn't necessary. Friday classes are optional, and the final is the performance of an original piece of music, but you can bring a recording as well. Highly recommended!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2007<br>Class Name: MUS107<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's an easy class, unless you don't have a good handle on music theory.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If youre hoping to actually learn anything about music composition, dont even bother.  I was very disappointed.  If youre a musician, i guarantee you that he will piss you off with his approach of composition.  However, the class was a pretty easy A.  Some demanding and time consuming assignments but easy nonetheless.  Indiv. Performance Final</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: MUS102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class hoping to learn more about music; i didn't. if you don't have composing experience, you won't do well. he says you don't have to have any, but you do. unclear with what he wants in his assignments. take it if you love composing & have hundreds of $$ worth of recording equiptment. nice guy, just not nice class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible Professor.  Do not take if you dont know how to already compose music.  He does not teach how to compose, but rather expects you to teach yourself.  I found the homework un-necessary and very un clear.  Attendence is mandatory and he watches for tardies. Wish i dropped it :(</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: MUS102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, along with a couple of small assignments, just make sure you're prepared to play a piece in front of the class at the end of the quarter for a final, and you'll be fine;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: MUS102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very nice guy, he only teaches this class in the winter. there's virtually no homework, attendance is optional, but talk to him toward the end of the quarter, the final is a performance and a report of everything your classmates do. It's a good class to take for an A&L requirement.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
