I devoted more time into this class than even my major classes combined to even pass. If she does not like you,  for my case, she calls you out in class and makes you seem like scum. She only gives vague comments on your paper. Please save yourself from this class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2015<br>Class Name: 241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Look, she gets a bad rap cuz her classes aren't easy. The reality is, you come to the class with an open mind about the subject, do the work , participate then you'll be fine. She's a China specialist, a sinologist in the good ol' European sense, if traditional China or Taiwan is your game you will have fun.  Her quizzes are guess proof though READ</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2015<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cedzich is really passionate about the subject matter, but she is extremely unclear. assignments are confusing and the quizzes are weirdly formatted. There is a lot of reading, which isn't too bad but she basically expects you to know everything up front and puts you on the spot if you don't an answer. not for an introverted student.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The way this intro class was set up was EXTREMELY unnecessary. The work load is extremely overwhelming for a 100 level course, and the concepts are NOT easy to understand. I think she expects everyone to only read for this course, which is truly absurd. The amount of actual work isn't bad (4 quizzes and 2 papers), but the readings are ridiculous.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2014<br>Class Name: BUDDHISM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>This was one of the hardest classes that I have ever take. The Professor was not helpful and was not approachable. To succeed you have to participate a lot during every class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2014<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't think I have disliked a professor this much the entire time I have been at DePaul. She was very hard to contact outside of class, hardly ever responded to emails and when she did they were cryptic and vague. She demanded that we think about the topic on a higher level that was very hard to achieve unless you spent hours outside of class tea</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2014<br>Class Name: REL241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok guys, let's set the record straight! Angelika is a good professor. Does she expect you to read closely? Yes. Will she call on you if you seem unprepared or disengaged? Yes. But, the readings are not long or dense, there were two papers and four quizzes - this class was totally manageable! Plus, she's really approachable and ready to help. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2014<br>Class Name: REL241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is unclear about directions and she gets in your face about topics. I dont recommend this class professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2014<br>Class Name: REL245<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken 3 courses with her. All of the negative reviews, if you are just trying skirt by in college, don't bother with good professors. She WILL ask a lot of you, as she should. She's amazing, pushes you hard to learn, and delivers in kind with enthusiasm. It's sad you're expecting the opposite. Best professor in all of my time at DePaul. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of DePaul students don't like to be challenged so I took the reviews with a grain of salt. She knows her stuff but is the perfect storm of expecting a LOT from you coupled with being extremely unclear. I learned a lot, but lost points due to confusion and I know I wasn't alone. Also, the quizzes she gave are an awful way to be evaluated.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: REL245<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly the worst teacher I have ever taken. The class seemed very interesting but lectures were completely unorganized. Constantly calls on people at random so better know your stuff or be prepared to be ridiculed in front of everyone. Expects you to know the textbook like the back of your hand and grades very harshly. Suggest to never sign up!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2014<br>Class Name: REL245<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's terrible. Worst teacher I've ever had. I'm okay with a heavy German accent, but when you can't even give clear instructions for anything there's a problem. Then she acts as if it's your fault, guilt tripping you, and you should feel bad. Her workload is insane, and her grading is harsh. I've never been so confused in a class before...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2014<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was horrible. The Buddhist experience is supposed to be a basic introductory course to the religion. I am in another "experience" religion course that is so much better. She expects you to just understand it immediately. Her directions are HORRIBLE. Just avoid this course if you don't know anything about buddhism</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: REL246<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Cedzich knows her stuff and you will learn from her, like it or not. She has very high expectations of preparedness, so bear that in mind. She liked me, but there were times when other students would get reprimanded for no reason. Overall, if you love the subject and have the time to put in the work, she's great. If not, try another class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2013<br>Class Name: AAS290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is hard work but you will definitely learn if you so choose to.  She expects a lot of her students.  However, because some students at DePaul are spoiled, lazy, and somewhat mentally challenged they complain.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2013<br>Class Name: AAS290305091<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this teacher. She treats the class like we are middle schoolers but expect us to perform as well as professors. She calls on you at random when you aren't paying attention and then will deliberately ignore you when you have your hand is raised. You just can't win.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2013<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I have ever had period. I did all the readings and the study guides, but I am still geting a poor grade. Nothing seems to help, she just says to try harder but, I honestly don't know what more I can do. The quizes are confusing and the teacher is no help. Avoid at all cost.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2013<br>Class Name: RL247201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She expects WAY too much out of you for a 200 level class. Grades ruthlessly. She is completely incomprehensible while lecturing; she will jump all over the place and spend all of your time talking about things that are not helpful to the class- and attendance is mandatory!! She'll roll her eyes if you don't know the answer. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2012<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my hardest class of the quarter, but I definitely learned a lot.  The work pays off, and if you put in a good effort your grade will definitely reflect.  She is very passionate about what she teaches, which shows.  I found her to be very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: REL245<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough, but in a good way.  You need to have a personality (she likes people unafraid to speak up).  If you think this is an easy class to pick up the RD requirement, check elsewhere.  If you actually want to LEARN something, she's a great prof.  Interesting stuff.  Highly recommended, for those who actually want to learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2011<br>Class Name: REL243<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perish the thought&#63; Ok, I have to wonder if I know you in real life.  Shes AWESOME  but you will work your butt off so slackers beware! Can you tell that she was meant to teach beyond the survey course level&#63; OF COURSE! But that's DePaul's fault not hers. If you love precommunist China and I DO then you will adore her. I do wish we'd discuss more..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2011<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is a lot of work. I was so interested in Buddhism until I took her class! For a group project we communicated through email because Blackboard wasn't working and she gave us a D for not using Blackboard! One of my least favorite professors!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2010<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>honestly, worst class i have EVER taken. it was extremely boring and wayyy too much work. Her grading is totally ambiguous, and expects everything to be absolutely perfect. If you're interesting in the subject, you'll enjoy it. but if you are considering taking this class just to fulfill the religious traditions requirement, DO NOT.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: REL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chooses very interesting subject material for class and is enthusiastic. Communicates general ideas well, but a bit convoluted with more complex ones. Expects more out of her students than your average 200-level course, probably. You'll actually have to read the texts and think about them to do well, perish the thought.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2008<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is very nice, but it is a difficult class. She wants you to do well, but has very high standards. Explain everything you write very very clearly and completely! She is very passionate about what she teaches, but difficult to understand often (and not just because of her accent, though with the asian words, it is difficult sometimes).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2008<br>Class Name: REL241<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cedzich is a very kind and intelligent woman. She is very passionate about what she teachers, and will lecture the whole class period. All the material is very interesting, but her standards are extremely high for assignments. This is a difficult class, so I suggest it if you are willing to put a lot of effort and interest in it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2008<br>Class Name: REL245<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have a busy schedule DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. She is very vague in the assignments; I'm still finding little things that I was supposed to do that I didn't even know about. I should have dropped this class when I had the chance. For a 200 level course this was way too much work. I don't think she's a horrible person though. She's pretty nice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2008<br>Class Name: REL241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is sweet, I don't know what everyone's problem is.... Not the easiest class but you will learn a lot.  I would definately recomend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2008<br>Class Name: REL241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is absolutely unqualified to teach.  Her lesson plans is complete rubbish, and was obviously not developed with actual students in mind.  This has been a total waste of my time.  The literature used and the viewpoints they express have not been relevant in nearly 40 years.  Do NOT take her classes unless you need to to graduate.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2008<br>Class Name: REL266<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't fathom why anyone wouldn't like this woman. She wants you to learn and makes class extremely interesting and inspiring. Do the homework, open your brains a fraction wider than the norm - and it will be a life-changing learning experience. Yeah, you will have readings for every class - they're not extensive, get over it. Welcome to college.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2008<br>Class Name: REL241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not a good teacher. She even tells you she is a hard teacher, but it makes no sense to be difficult for the sake of being difficult. She doesn't try to instill any interest in the course, and expects you to love everything and know it inside and out. Also, she is never wrong so don't try to argue with her, it's always your fault.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THis is the worst Professor.  I have never dropped a class in my life and this is the first one.  I thought it would be interesting but it was a regular boot camp.  She is not a good teacher, that is that.  If you see her, run the other way.  She shouldn't be teaching in America, she should go back to germany and maybe that will help her out.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2007<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not an extremely hard class.  You have to work very hard and do the required readings.  As for homework it is suggested that you do the study guides before each class.  There are 2 formal submissions of study guides, 4 quizes and a final paper. Class is very interesting and don't but off the final paper.  Get it done as soon as possible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2007<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she gives u tons and tons of work, i wanted to take this cuz it seemed interesting but its like work everyday and its not easy and she is always expecting 110% from you i got sick of the class already the second week. if you want to take a religon and shes the teacher you should most definitely look for a different class, or atleast a diff teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2007<br>Class Name: RELSECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>love this class =)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2007<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Though her class requires a lot of work, and it takes a while to adjust to her method of teaching/asking questions, she gives you study guides with everything you'll need to know for class/tests. Make sure you DO THE STUDY GUIDES before every class- it will make your life SOO much easier.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: REL243<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I honestly don't see people's problem.  She's not a terribly easy grader, but she tells you everything she wants up front and none of it's unreasonable.  She &quot;requires&quot; study guides every class, but only collects 3 and tells you which ones - so don't do the rest.  AND she's intelligent, helpful and extremely knowledgeable about her topic.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2007<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This lady is kinda nice.. She is willing to listen, to you but you will not give you any slack.. You have to turn paper on line, and if you are a second late too bad... The topic is decent, but you got to read over and over to understand it..Get ready to work!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2007<br>Class Name: REL241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I also think they are being too harsh. It is an intense class, with a lot of work. But if you put the effort in, you'll enjoy they class. There were great discussions and she was very knowledgable about the material. Yes, she's foreign, but her accent is not so hard that you can't understand her. I had a great time in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think people are being harsh.  I did less than half of the readings, said something once every class, paid attention mostly, and did fine.  The &quot;work&quot; people are referring to was three study guides, which are just answers to questions on the reading. 3 quizzes, no tests, one final paper. She was clear with all of her requirements on the syllabus.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: CHINREL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an awesome professor!!!
