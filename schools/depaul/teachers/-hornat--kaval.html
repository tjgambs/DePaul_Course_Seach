She is sweet and will help you as much as she can. She gives extensions, and grades fairly easy. If you are having trouble talk to her about and make it a good relationship and she'll help you out. But the content in the class is kind of boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HK was awesome. papers were very easy, group work was not that bad and she's very helpful when you meet with her one-on-one. Not to mention she gives you a free 2 week extension for a paper of your class. Would definitely take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: WRD301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a Finance/Econ double major and WRD minor, I am very happy that I completed this class. Patient, kind, and understanding are great words to describe Professor HK. Do the work, ask questions, and take ownership of your grade.  Willing to help, only if you show the effort.  I am happy to say because of her I discovered a passion.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Frustrating class, took two months before we got any feedback from her. After a while, the class felt very repetitive and assignments definitely could have been better. Disappointing. :/ She is a nice person, so-so as a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: WRD301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A really interesting class... not sure where so many negative comments come from.  She does have a low tolerance for people who don't do the work, but I can understand that.  If you're willing to put in the work, HK will bend over backwards to help you.  She is super available and knows lots about her area.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2010<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you do not like group work, do NOT take this class. Break up into groups every day and discuss. The subject is VERY dry. The only thing you learn in this class is how to write a memo and be concise. There; you've taken the course. Attendance is mandatory. Show up late and it counts as an absence. The teacher is nice, but the class is a wreck.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2010<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, this class is easy. But if you don't like group work, do NOT take this class. Group work every class and a presentation at the end of the course. Attendance is mandatory. Late to class == absence. The basis of the class is writing instruction manuals.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ill be very frank, and not emotionally driven: if you hate doing work, hate learning, and desire a non-engaging, easy-A, then sign up for her. But if you prefer you dont pay for teachers to look up YouTube videos to show you, prepare nothing, and teach you jack squat--and cover it up with the sunshine treatment--run for the hills.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HK is a really good professor. She's extremely nice and helpful when you go directly to her and ask questions. Attendance is absolutely mandatory and if you miss more than 3 classes you fail the class, so make sure you go. If you do your homework and bring it on time then you will pass the class. It's pretty simple..just don't use your phone in cla</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2009<br>Class Name: WRD301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a sweet professor, extremely nice and easy to talk to. I don't think she is a hard grader, maybe everyone who took the class prior was just dumb&#63; I do think 301 was MUCH less challenging then it sounds though. I would recommend her always enjoyed what she had to say.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite professor this quarter. I will agree that she is a tough grader, but I went in and met with her all the time and she was always willing to help me with my papers. I learned a lot from her!! I would take her again in a heartbeat.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof HK! Is the best! she wants all her students to do well she is a bit of a hard grader but if you want to get an A take the extra step and go see her she will tell you what to fix so you can do so what a great prof i would love to take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2008<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sweet teacher. Tries to run with the class like a job. Class consist of one final project. With assignments leading up to it. Its an easy class. Turn things in on time and dont come late to class. Id take her class again. She always let u out early too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor HK is soo nice! you'll totally enjoy her class. she is a really hard grader though but she's sweet.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was great.

But at times I felt like I was in a middle school class. But don't let that  mistake you, she is a hard grader. And since most of the papers are worth 5 points it's easy to go from an A to a C.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2007<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very organized and explains each assignment in full detail.
