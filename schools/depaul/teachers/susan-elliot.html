Isn't clear about anything she wants you to do. Doesn't teach anything just tells you to read the book. When you get your grades back no one understands why they got that grade. Don't take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2007<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have a feeling she wont be teaching at DePaul anymore. she was very unclear of what she expected and this was her first time teaching and it didnt go over so well. its a waste of money, however, easy because all her tests are open book because she doesnt believe in memorizing anything.</div></div></div></body></html>
