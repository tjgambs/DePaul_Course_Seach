The most boring teacher EVER!  Just hear him talk is like listening to a chalk screeching on a blackboard.  He has a class manual that is 367 pages! A book that is 672 pages!  I'll tell you, the 367 page class manual is just HORRIBLE! He uses the word &quot;thing&quot; all the time- very poor vocab!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
