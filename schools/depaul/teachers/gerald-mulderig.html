It is proof of his excellent teaching that I still remember him to this day. He is inspiring and intellegent but will not be easy on you!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2010<br>Class Name: ENEDIT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Editing was an awful class. Mulderig constantly insulted students, saying, &quot;It's not brain surgery!&quot; whenever people gave wrong answers. Newsflash: it's his clouded, fuzzy teaching methods that cause the wrong answers. He contradicted himself several times and disagreed with the Chicago Manual of Style.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2008<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>took him 9 yrs ago as a freshman. couldn't have made it through undergrad/grad school w/o his class. omg did i learn a LOT. now that i'm a high school english teacher, i try to model some of my lessons after him. even have 2 copies of his book--one at home & one in my classroom! he helped me outside of class countless times so i'd &quot;get it&quot;.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Will call you out if you are wrong but worth taking.  Opinionated but that is not a bad thing</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2007<br>Class Name: ENG403<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mulderig is awesome. He is extremely difficult, extremely interesting and extremely entertaining. He is a bit of a stickler to classroom etiquette. He will call you out if you are wrong answering a question. Still, I recommend him and this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2007<br>Class Name: ENG272<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be on time or you will be kicked out of the class. You miss four times and you are out. I enjoyed the readings and the quizzes are easy. He grades hard on the papers and the test is way to easy. Have fun!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2006<br>Class Name: ENG272<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2006<br>Class Name: ENG272<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you do not know how to be on time to class, then do not waste your time taking him. Daily quizzes that are semi-easy. Asks about minor details from the readings so read carefully. Difficult class but seems easy because the readings are interesting and so is discussion. Likes to believe he is openminded but not really. Great class. Easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2006<br>Class Name: ENG272<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LITERATURE & IDENTITY:LGBTQ .DON'T be late or miss too many classes.  It is a fairly hard class but very interesting. Quizzes are not tough as long as you do the reading. Papers are tough but fair.  Anyone interested in Gay and Lesbian literature I would highly recommend it to.  We do alot of group discussions so it makes the class fun.DONT be LATE</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Annoying in his backhandedness.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: ENG400<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. M is awesome.

Before his class I never got below an &quot;A-&quot; on a paper and I am a senior (who works at the writing center)! Then he wrongfully accused me of plagiarism, screamed at me loud enough for everyone in the English department to hear, and tried to fail me for the class. He had no evidence and had to drop the accusation. Gave me a &quot;C-&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2006<br>Class Name: STUDYABROAD<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mulderig is a misunderstood man. He is extraordinarily nice and personable if you don't BS him. He expects a lot of his student, but you will get a lot in return if you put in the work. He is very knowledgable, but not very good at reading maps (watch out study abroad kids!). GOOD GRAMMER IS A MUST... he wrote a manual on it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2006<br>Class Name: ENG496<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class (Editing)! Prof Mulderig is accessible, helpful, and so patient. I learned a ton from the class; he's one of my all-time fav teachers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>my favorite class i've taken here and probably my favorite prof. he's so incredible and so passionate about the material in class. i love him and definitely recommend taking him if you can. you'd be lucky to have him. so amazing!  really- he deserves and award or something</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>teacher is VERY biased, failed my paper based on his opinion, up until that point thought he was a good teacher, my opinion changed very quickly... save yourself the stress and take another professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2005<br>Class Name: INDEPSTUDY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: ENG398HST398<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grades not given 2 months after trip ended.

He is knowledgeble, but isn't great at teaching Turkish. He is generally pretty understanding of that though. He is pretty anal retentive, so watch your grammar on the paper. I think he's pretty cool, but he definetely has his moments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very arrogant; wastes class time simply to show off his academic writing, which is extremely boring.

Good intentions and will be very understanding if you are respectful to him. Be very careful about quotations he will not hesitate to drop you for plagirism, even accidental. He is always there if you need any help out of class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2005<br>Class Name: ENG403MAW<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst class and professor I've ever taken. People in their 1stQ dropped the MAW program because of him. Was rude and accused me of plagarism (my quotes didn't translate from one computer program to another). Didn't learn a thing in class; everyone in my class complained. Bust my butt to get a B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2005<br>Class Name: 4063<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor, especially if you're a serious student who really wants to learn something.
