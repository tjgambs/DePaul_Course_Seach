Always has a good discussion and shows good films. A few papers and quizzes, but overall pretty easy and a nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2010<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have him right now and he is totally awesome, witty, interesting and fun. I love all the projects he assigns and instructs on each individual steps with total clarity. Plus he lets you know about events outside of class that are going on pertaining to animation. He is absolutely fantastic and definitely easy on the eyes if you know what I mean.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: ANI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very laid back teacher but still gets students to learn and improve in animation.  Kept lectures somewhat casual and usually pretty interesting.  Definitely worth taking.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this is a great prof for this class. very helpful, approachable and nice and was pretty passionate about this class. do not need any prior exp of animation to enjoy or do well, he teaches you everything! but expect to work a lot outside of class! projects due every week, 3 papers (only 2 pgs!)and a 15 sec movie final of whatever you want.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2009<br>Class Name: ANI105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love him!

The class was super intense and you were constantly work, but it wasn't too bad. He is a fairly easy grader, it was just some of his lectures are boring. He was available outside of class which I liked. I would say you should take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2008<br>Class Name: DC233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I heard that Alexander once participated in an eating competition with Scott Roberts to eat 50 eggs in an hour, just like the scene in Cool Hand Luke.  You should ask him about it some time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2008<br>Class Name: ANI105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All kinds of awesome.
