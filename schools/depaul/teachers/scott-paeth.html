We had 4 papers, pretty clear expectations and he was always willing to meet outside of class to help clarify anything. Good at connecting reading to discussions. Participation in discussions is a must and you have to do at least some of the reading so you can contribute. An understanding and helpful guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: REL251<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Paeth is a very intelligent guy, and makes many references throughout his lectures to help understand the material. Despite him being a very good teacher, he did assign our class three medium-sized essays and a research paper along with a good amount of reading.

This class is exactly what we should be going to college for -- regardless of the workload, he genuinely cares about the material and does his best to help you through it. Deeply intelligent (it's hard not to have an intellectual crush on him), kind, and funny.

Be sure to stay on top of everything, attend class, and take lots of notes! I was dreading taking a religion class, the class discussions were awesome, and he's also funny, nice, and more than willing to help if you're lost. I highly suggest him, but stay motivated!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2012<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Paeth really is passionate about the subject. With that said, do not take his summer class if you are looking for a blow-off. Took it just to get the credit in and worked pretty hard for the grade. A lot of readings (I read this before taking the class too).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, a fountain of knowledge.

Prof. Paeth is very nice and interested in the subject matter. There is alot of reading, but most of the material is thought provoking. There are 2 short papers and 1 long one and thats it really, besides reading and attendence.

While there is a lot of reading for this class, it is not always required to participate in class. We did not always stay on topic but none-the-less learned a ton. No test. 2 short papers and 1 long. He gave several extra credit chances.

A.) Doesn't talk about the reading in class B.) Expects you to read 7 books over 9 weeks C.) Requires attendance.

There are 3 papers: 2 small, 1 research (final), and weekly online postings. He's really interesting/smart, and as long as you ask the right questions he?ll stay on topic of the books.

I think this man is the king of books, if you visit his office they are literally every where. Needless to say, you'll do a good amount of reading. Thought this class would be about RELIGION and WAR but we've mostly just talked about War, and finally getting into religion in the second half of the quarter... overall an OK class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2010<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are a lot of books to read but as the prof says you don't need to read every single page. He's very well read and that makes discussions interesting. Participation is important and it doesn't have to relate to the readings so speak up. Ask for help on papers if you're confused. Proofread your work and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Paeth expects way too much reading.  There is little reason to read the books as the discussions rarely if ever have anything to do with the readings.  The class seems interesting.

His grading is t</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT TEACHER!!! He does make you read a lot and depending on you class the discussions may go off topic, but having the discussions go off topic is the best part of the class. The readings are relevant to the course and he chooses them for a reason so do the readings. He's understand and will let you modify his essay assignments if you ask him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2009<br>Class Name: REL288<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher..The worst teacher I have ever taken at Depaul..He makes you read over 200 pages for class then doesn't even talk about the readings..Save yourself and don't take him..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Focal point seminar...extremely boring.

I don't know how he did it but maybe it was because he clearly knows what he is doing and i always thought religion is all about church stuff.

There's lots of talking, reading and writing. I am not kidding... You have to force yourself to write ljournals for each class and give your opinion.

He is a really tough grader and expects way too much of freshman! I don't think anybody enjoyed that class! It's supposed to be somewhat easy discover chicago and it ended up being more work than my other three classes combined! He tries to help, but frankly doesn't make any sense!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard grader on papers~</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: PAX200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>his lectures are interesting...but he grades too hard on his papers....its hard to get higher than a B! his unclear on what his looking for in papers....so if you are concerned about grades dont take him...he assigns alot of reading but they are very intresting.....his really smart without being arrogant</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thougth the class was really intersting... he expects a lot of reading and there usually is a paper due every week, but come on, suck it up.

His lectures are boring and you have a paper due every week.  If it weren't for his class I would have been on the Dean's List.  The best grade I ever got on a paper was a B and I was one of the lucky ones.  He's a nice guy, but his class is rough and I wouldn't recommend it.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
