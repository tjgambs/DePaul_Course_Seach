She's also very helpful and personable. Taught in a seminar style so lots of discussion. This class was a major inspiration for me. Really got me into WGS. Can be difficult at times but worthwhile. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2014<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marie was a great professor. A huge part of your grade is discussion and she really likes people to talk in class. She uses videos and relates things to the news and current events to help students understand the readings. There is a lot of reading but it's interesting and she goes over everything. Recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really intelligent and passionate about what she teaches. Lots of reading that can be confusing but she explains things very well (and can in multiple dif ways if you're still confused) she's always willing to help!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was dreading this class but she made it really fun and interesting. There is a lot of reading but she is willing to work with you outside of class and lets you revise papers. Overall, amazing class and professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is young and quirky but I would NEVER take her again. I always studied hard for her tests but the questions on the tests are so unnecessarily tricky and confusing that I always got a bad grade, even though I knew the material. Also she assigns SO MUCH HOMEWORK, even during midterm week! She thinks her class is the only one that matters</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2012<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An incredibly intelligent and caring person. Very helpful in explaining extremely difficult course material. Young, hip, friendly, understanding. yes, there is reading to be done, a lot. but it's worth it because she explains all of it and makes it easy to get good paper grades as long as you pay attention in class. I love this lady!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2011<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome prof. I just took it as a requirement but it ended up being my favorite class. If you are confused just go talk to her and she'll really help you out. She has a good sense of humor and always uses video clips and conversation to help everyone understand the ideas. Overall, recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great lectures. Big participation grade. Young and funny and keeps you interested. Good class for PI requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was disappointed in this class. She taught it more as a gender studies course and not a philosophy course. She seems to pick favorites and won't acknowledge your opinions if you're not one of them, so then you're screwed for class participation. I would not recommend to tak this course with her. It had potential but she did not live up to it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marie was a great professor. The material was interesting and although there was a lot of it, there wasn't a required textbook. You are expected to put some work into this class, but even participating each week will count favorably towards your grade. Learned alot!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this teacher, shes young funny and really awesome... I love philosophy because of her, she keeps class interesting and likes people to participate which is necessary in a classroom. She is also a hard grader and if you get into the theme of the class and read your stuff youll actually get interested in it. Loved it!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very smart and helpful. She will respond to all your questions if you ask her. If you take this class just follow the readings and you will be ok. Also she is very funny has a sense of humor most of the time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really interesting class, cute and funny prof, but do the reading and come to class if you want a decent grade</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not, I repeat, do not take this teacher. She is not very organized, will talk and talk even though it's a seminar class (not lecture). I have done more work for an LSP class than my IT/IS classes. Take her classes at your discretion. Don't say you weren't warned. Oh and she is uber meticulous about assignments. Too anal.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the class was so boring because we would review the same material and discussion 2 days in a row. writing the papers were difficult. grading was unclear but gave excellent feedback if you email a rough draft to her tons of readings to print out on black board. the class was ok but very boring becasue it felt like you were have the same conversation</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class is really interesting. i'm not really into philosophy but she's nice and makes the class interesting. i liked learning about prisons and that she made it modern. but don't take it unless you want to discuss.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is very sweet. She's a really nice person and in my opinion a pretty easy grader. This course requires A LOT of reading, not from a text but print out reading from blackboard. Sometimes she loses herself in her talking, but she knows her stuff. Her &quot;notes&quot; on board are pretty unorganized. Overall, recommended teacher. Loved her.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
