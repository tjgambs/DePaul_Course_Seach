The homework is ridiculous and by the time she actually grades the first two weeks assignments, its past midterm week, so thats when you find out you're not doing so hot in the class. She gives no explanation as to why you did poorly, and has horrible communication skills.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2015<br>Class Name: DC227<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is the worst class I've taken at DePaul. She isn't clear on the homework and mixes readings from different chapters into one homework assignments, even when it says it's only from one chapter. She also grades very slow so you never know what grade you have in the class. If you have questions about a grade received she won't help you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2015<br>Class Name: DC227<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: WD</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID AT ALL COSTS. She makes no sense and it's almost impossible to get a good grade unless you're able to decipher her confusing assignment instructions. She's rude and not willing to help. She isn't prompt with giving assignment grades so by the 4th week in you finally find out you aren't doing well. She shouldn't be a professor. Waste of money.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2015<br>Class Name: DC227SP<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>She literally does not make it clear what she's looking for in your responses on homework. The films you watch are not good for the most part. She doesn't give you help in a friendly way, she's more concerned with her own agenda and making sure you know what that is. My least favorite teacher and class. Not helpful, not friendly, not good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2014<br>Class Name: DC206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class online. It was pretty easy. I stopped watching the lectures 1/4th of the way through. You just have to make sure you do the readings and answer the questions with detail. Take it online rather than the 3 hour class. Watching the lectures were boring. MUST have the book. She's also helpful when it comes to answering questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2012<br>Class Name: DC323<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Harwood is more interested in discussing herself and screening her dull student films than she is with advising and helping her own students. Her instructions were unclear and she was unconcerned with the fact that sole program for the course was available only on a couple dozen computers that were rarely open for use.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2010<br>Class Name: DC323<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is very demanding.  However, she never actually informs the students of what she requires and then grades assignments as if the students should already know the answers.  Do not take this class from her!!  She is extremely condescending when she responds to your questions.  She doesn't really seem to care that the students aren't learning</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
