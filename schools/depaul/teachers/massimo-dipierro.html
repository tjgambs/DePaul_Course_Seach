It's not super clear what the point of the class is or what my take aways are, but it was a good physics class. He's very smart, but not good at helping us understand. There's a lot missing from the apply your learning step. Take if you know physics or can teach yourself. Assignments are pretty easy, no tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2011<br>Class Name: CSC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher. If it weren't for the poor documentation, he would be teaching an excellent web framework. Doesn't always reply to emails but he answers lingering questions in the web2py google group. Start early on your project, be creative, be sure to work in a group, and you've got yourself an A. Also... the book is online for free.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2011<br>Class Name: CSC308<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice guy but strict grading cut offs</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2005<br>Class Name: TDC561<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful. His teaching technique involves spending much of the class time writing small example programs, explaining what he's doing along the way, while the class watches on the data projector. Also, very willing to spend time with you in his office to explain things. Homework was reasonable and graded in a timely manner. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2005<br>Class Name: IT378<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Explains everything you need to know to do well in the class and with the material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: IT378<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

His notes and supplemental material are always excellent. I took him for C++ and his notes were better than any book I have used.
