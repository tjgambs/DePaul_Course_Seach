In an even better time he's my professor. I have learned so many tricks and tips from this guy to enhance my value as a web developer. He is one of the most inspirational people I've ever met. I have him for IT394 and IT395 next two quarters, and I cant wait. Hands down one of the best.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2015<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Although LSP 121 is just a pain, Prof. Chase is a good guy to take it with. He definitely wants to help and goes so far out of his way to ensure that everyone passes- he gives lots of second chances and extra help on the sides. His only problem is talking too much during the time we should work on activities in class. Would highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2015<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Math and computers are a weak spot for me, so I'm really glad that I had professor Chase! He's such a pro that he may seem impatient and smug at times, but he really does just want to help you. If this is a subject you struggle in, just be intentional about receiving extra help and he will bend over backwards to provide it. EXTREMELY helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2015<br>Class Name: IT320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A three hour class seems long, but with Professor Chase, it flies by! He's one of the best professors I have ever had. He is always willing to help and knows his stuff! If you have to take this class, I HIGHLY recommend taking it with him. As long as you show up and do the work, the class will be a breeze! I would definitely take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: IT320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a person with great communication skills, you won't be ever be bored in his class. However, he's not very effective in making us learn. He would say the obvious things on the slides and tell us what to do, but won't let us think and do some excercises independently. The assignments are ridiculously easy but time consuming. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2015<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the last course I needed to take before I could graduate. Needless to say, Stats and utilizing databases such as Access and SPSS are not my forte. Instructor Chase was flexible, understanding and dedicated to the success of his students. Offered extensions for assignments that were difficult and stayed after class often to help. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: IT320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unlike many professors his teaching style was very practical and real world.  For an introductory course, a lot of concepts are covered as well as mentioned for future study.   Always shares the latest info on the subject and is helpful.  Time consuming assignments, but worth it.  Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: IT320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Very organized</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2014<br>Class Name: IT320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor and he is willing to help his students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2014<br>Class Name: IT320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's dedicated to his student's success, but doesn't quite know what to teach for a subject so broad.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is TERRIBLE, but he makes it pretty enjoyable. I would take a programming class with him if I had the electives. night lectures are long, but he is knowledgeable and cares about the subject and his students. I would highly recommend him if you need to take this class. No textbook, all online.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: IT320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His projects are not hard. It's not like a programming class. If you do what he says you get an A. They are time consuming. He says that the only way to learn a tool is to actually spend time with it. I found this class to be extremely useful in determining what exactly I want to do in the workforce. I do think it will be something to do with CMS's</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: IT320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a fun class and the professor is awesome. His powerpoints are super helpful and informative. He gives you everything you need to do all the assigments. Its so hard to fail this class. I reccommend it for sure</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2013<br>Class Name: IT320<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't recommend this professor. His homework is extra super hard. Trust me, avoid. This is the only class he teaches so he is super crazy about it. Nice guy, just the amount of work is too much to handle. He lectures for 3 hours during the night class sessions. Will bore you like crazy. TRUST ME! DON'T TAKE</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
