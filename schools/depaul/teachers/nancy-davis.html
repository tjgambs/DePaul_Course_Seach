One discussion post per week. Occasionally an assignment. So much reading which I barely did, still got 100% on everything. BUT, she is disorganized and hard to reach. Had to chase her up about things I didn't get turned back, didn't respond to emails or class questions. Easy grader though, Overall positives outweigh negatives.

Exchanged 2 emails the entire term. No feedback on early assignments, despite promises. No feedback on work at all. The material is easy, I think, as I said, one email to say hello and then a grade when the class ended. Unresponsive to other communication.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: DO1534<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love nancy I think she is the best teacher ever we need a lot more like her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2006<br>Class Name: LL300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2004<br>Class Name: E1E2<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This gal was just painful. Painful, painful. Non-responsive, non-participatory, and unclear. But, it's probably an &quot;A&quot; if you don't mind ZERO feedback throughout the course. In essence, you're rolling the dice.</div></div></div></body></html>
