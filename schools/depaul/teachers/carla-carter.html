She teaches this course better than I've heard other professors do. You actually write the first couple chapters of a research paper (with a group) and only meet with her 20 minutes once a week, instead of going to class. Bottom Line: take 410 with Carla!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2013<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Carter is an AWESOME teacher! She is very laid back and upfront about what she expects from you. We read from the book every week, but also went over the key ideas in class. We often were let go a bit early, which is nice during an evening class. Sometimes conversations would go off topic, which was fun. I recommend her for any course!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2012<br>Class Name: SGC401<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took an introductory to Research Methods for the College of Education. Dr. Carter is an amazing teacher. She was interested in being available, not worrying to much about attendance and more about what you learned and how much you helped your teammates. I loved her class and would take any other class she taught in a heart beat. Learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Carla is an AWESOME professor! She is easy-going and makes class interesting. The class was lecture-discussion, and even though it was scheduled for 3 hours, we always got out at about an hour early. Something due every week (easy) and a final project (fun to do). I would recommend her to anyone...I wish she taught more classes I has to take!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2010<br>Class Name: LSI446<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Carla is a really smart, nice, lenient teacher.  We met in class twice, and the rest of the quarter we met for 15 minutes twice a week in our groups.  This was really helpful in order to balance my schedule.  My only complaint isn't about Carla (Dr. Carter), but that the class seems kinda useless for the degree....</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
