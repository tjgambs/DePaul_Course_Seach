That's all I can say.Do bother taking him. He doesn't care about his students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really can find nothing to complain about with Lampe. In fact, he is an excellent professor. I dreaded having to take economics as part of my int. studies major, but this class actually has led me to consider a minor in econ! He is creative with class time and works hard to engage everybody in a seemingly uninteresting subject. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Standard micro econ class. He's young so he still has that passion for teaching and it seems like he really wants his students to understand the material. Homework and practice tests are identical to actual tests. I feel like I'm being lectured by the Australian Hugh Grant.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2011<br>Class Name: ECO313<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor, exams closely resemble the practice exams he gives out. Quantitative questions are identical with numbers changed, but be prepared for some left-field qualitative questions on the midterm/final. Just be sure to look over the powerpoint slides, specifically the case studies, before each exam and you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>his class is not bad. I took it and got an A but I did some studying. if you take him make sure you learn the concepts and not just how to re-do the problems. Don't buy the textbook because you will never need it. His homework is easy but a lot of people struggled in the class because the final was cumulative, hard and 50% of your grade</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are willing to work hard, Lampe is an amazing professor.  He is always quick to respond to e-mails, and his teaching methods are exceptional.  THe final is worth 50% of your grade, but if you attend class and study hard, you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sadthat he thinks 72 average..you might be doing good up to final, but if you don't do well on final(50%) of your class grade you will can end up with a low grade. As a professor hes OK but needs to change how much the final is worth. As well as he likes to give problems that are twice as complicated as his hw, or practice tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty good professor, although his exams are HARD. You better study and come prepared to class everyday or you won't do well. As someone previously mentioned, the class average on the final was a 72 and he didn't curve it. Regardless, the guy has a Stanford PhD and knows his econ, just not sure he knows how to give fair exams.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this professor thinks a 72 class average is acceptable without a curve. makes everything seem easy until he critically grades your test. needs to realize a c minus is a passing grade. i feel he is a different professor from last year</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lampe is a good teacher, he just has one of those voices that is almost monotonous and makes you want to sleep. The midterm and final were pretty hard, but both had review sections that I should have gone to. Book isn't used, but after taking Macro, i could see where the book would come in handy for this class. Take him, but pay attention.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2010<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Coolest professor at Depaul! His accent is OMG! His lectures quick, after every class i didnt want to leave.....ahhh ;] four hw assignments and prepares everyone for the exams. Excellent professor! EVERYONE TAKE HIM</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2010<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ryan is one of the most helpful, easy to understand professors I have ever had the privilege of taking a class with. His method of teaching almost fools you into learning everything you need to know, and prepares every student for further study of economics. Take his classes if at all possible</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2010<br>Class Name: ECO313<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HOT!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2010<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First and foremost, Lampe is hot. He's got swagger and an Australian accent, what more do you need to know&#63; He gives 4 graded HW assignments and practice exams just like mt and final. Constantly making lame jokes and all of the girls laugh only bc of his hotness. For an enjoyable experience in econ eJUST TAKE HIM</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2010<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing prof. He makes it easy to understand the material and explains everything in a way that makes wen hard material seem easy. This was my first Econ class and I got a high A. Plus, he's absolutely gorgeous! Definitely a hottie!  :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: ECO313<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love this guy. 4 HWs, midterm and final. He's super clear when explaining difficult material. I thought the class was easy and expect an A (didnt use book) but others had a hard time. I didnt take 305 or 306 but everyone else reallyyy recommends it. Just study all the practice exams because youll see the same material in exams.Oh and he's gorgeous!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2010<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing Professor. Makes Economics FUN and EASY. He keeps class interesting. Just 5 homework assignments and 3 exams. Exams are easy and he gives you a study guide/practice exam. I dont see how anyone could get less than a B in his class. But don't buy the textbook... you wont need/use it. Great class! TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
