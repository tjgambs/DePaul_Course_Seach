The teacher cannot teach, cannot be heard, and cannot speak proper english. For 10 weeks you learn nothing, he has to curve everything but it doesn't help. Study guide isnt like the MT.

He should stick to law and leave!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Means well and is very helpful if you seek him out..but cannot teach at all..the material is very &quot;fundamental&quot; so he cannot bring it down to understandable terms because he is a corporate lawyer, and should not be teaching Stats..also has a very heavy accent, but makes u laugh with his jokes :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2004<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice Teacher knows his s***, just can't teach it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>prof weejin is the best teacher ever met. he does take care of students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2004<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I cannot understand a single thing this man says - and that has nothing to do with his accent.
