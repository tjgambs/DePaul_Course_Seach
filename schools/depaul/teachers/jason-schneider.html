He was always really interested in what students had to say and was really helpful! His homework load got a little tedious at times but it wasn't the worst thing in the world to handle. I ended up learning a lot in his class. Overall, I'd recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures make me want to die a horrible death, also readings every week with questions which is annoying at first but they're easy. I think he gives "alright" feedback on the papers. Personally he just annoys me, but he was an ok professor </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely helpful.  He reads all completed papers and gives great feedback.  As long as you fix what he recommended in his feedback, you will get an A.  Readings with questions once a week, but they take thirty minutes at the longest. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2015<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really great guy, easy to talk to and wants to get to know his students. He's a very easy grader. He truly loves the Polish culture and knows a lot about it, LSP was great because of the field trips. But there is a group project, a lot of reading, and theres an out of class field trip you have to go to and then write about. Easy class though!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class as long as you do your assignments.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
