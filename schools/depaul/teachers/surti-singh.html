She's cute and keeps the class atmosphere light. There is a decent workload but it's very easy work. You need the book for your papers (there are a few 2-3 page papers) and your midterm. Midterm is the hardest part of the class. Otherwise just presentations.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2011<br>Class Name: PHL234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of my favorite prof! She was always willing to meet. She helped shed light on a number of different concepts.  I enrolled in an upcoming philosophy course to have her teach again.  I really liked how she was open for discussions and not only asked questions, but waited for an answer and helped us think throught them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2010<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would definately agree that she goes in circles without even getting to the point or question asked. It's like you even doubt yourself. I would also agree with the other post that she does not return papers,maybe 3-4 weeks later. small presentation,midterm,1 written assignment, final, and lots of reading.Not as easy as you would think for an Intr</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2010<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unclear, read straight from the book and just not very experienced in teaching.  It's difficult to know what she wants because she does not clarify very well.  The irony in her being a logic professor did not escape me at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talks in circles. Never returns anything. Does not answer emails. The material is dense and she doesn't do well at explaining it. She's willing to meet for office hours but then just regurgitates what she said in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor, probably my favorite so far at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An excellent professor! She clearly explains difficult concepts and gives you every opportunity to succeed in her class. After her class, I began to enjoy and understand philosophy. If you take notes and listen attentively, you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite professors so far. She is extremely good at making confusing and difficult readings/concepts easy to understand. She is very willing to help those who seek for it. Very knowledgeable and great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely extremely hot. I found myself getting lost in her good looks. The class is pretty easy as long as you study before the tests, which she gives out pretty detailed guides for so it's no biggie. Although her lectures can be boring. If you're looking for an easy class with a hot teacher to look at so you don't fall asleep.

If you just want to get a good grade and not work hard then look somewhere else. 4 texts required, online discussion board, protocol, and mandatory attendance. She gets ticked off if you don't pay attention in the class. She might just pick on you. Final words, she is really pretty and knowledgeable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2009<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes a cutie and you dont really have to read because she goes over everything in class and she also gives out amazing study guides before the test...the worst part of the class is doing the discussion board each week. pay attention and its an easy A/B</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was hot, but she can't teach. The class is really boring. I thought it would be an easy A but I had to put in a good amount of work. Lots of reading. Wouldn't recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is boring but easy.  You are forced to write on the discussion board each week and once in the quarter to do a review of the past class.  The study guides have everything you need for the quizzes on there.  Easy A if you do the study guides.  She's hot but not smoking.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok so she is one of the better looking professors at DePaul.. Get over it. The class is very easy: Read the book, and she goes over the material very well in class. 3 'exams.' No final. The exams can easily be reviewed with in class notes. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The person who posted on 3/9/07 doesn't know what he/she is talking about.

The class time is all lecture but its actually interesting if you just do your work. She is really smart and really nice (and pretty). Just don't slack on the easy work she gives you and you'll do great.  I def recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes OK..her class is CRAZY boring. and you can barely hear the lady when she talks. as long as u pay attention in class, your set.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a beautiful teacher that you will have not trouble paying attention to!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy class just put sopme effort into the assignments.

The material is kind of hard but if you do your work you should get an A or a B. teacher is very smart. knows her stuff well. also happens to be smokin hott. daymmm.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2006<br>Class Name: PH100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is pretty easy teacher, and helpful too, but all aside she is really hotttttttttt</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you don't get an C or better in this class, you probably never attended. Ridiculously redundant with material, makes sure you grasp it. Can be boring if you have no interest whatsoever in PHL (she talks slightly slower than normal pace) But if you are interested, you will find it thought provoking and will be compelled to participate.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful, the material is way harder than the acutal class. If she doesn't think you understand she will go over it (helpful) but then sort of beat you over the head with it. This is hard because not all the class is on the same pace- But she cares and isn't unrealistic with work or grading- overall GOOD class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think she is very helpful and not boring at all. There's always casual humor in the class and she makes sure everyone understands before moving on. Highly recommend and yes, she IS hot, even from a female perspective.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is hot, but isn't exactly the best teacher. Class is pretty boring and her monotone voice makes it difficult to stay awake. She knows the material herself but has a hard time making it clear. Major pluses: no midterm and final. Your grade is based on 3 short papers (3 pages), one final paper of about 5-7 pages, and homework assigned once a week</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2005<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to go to class just to stare at a hott teacher then i recommend this class for you. Other than that, this class has to be the most boring and stupid class on earth.  She has no idea on wat she is doing. She cant teach for is her life depended on it. Material is hard to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2005<br>Class Name: PHI101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can get an A in this class, but it does not require GOING to class. Lectures are very boring, and she literally talks for 1.5 hours.  It is hard to participate becuase the subject matter is VERY difficult. NO tests, just papers that are graded easily. Shes pretty hot too!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decent teacher. Doesn't quite explain the material. If you read and pay attention, you will do fine. She appreciates the effort more than anything. If you are looking for a teacher to hold your hand, she is not for you. She is VERY hot, from Canada...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was bad at giving back papers on time.

Not the caliber teacher you would expect at DePaul.  Seems to have little, if any, enthusiasm for subject.  Grasp of knowledge is not as high as it could be.
