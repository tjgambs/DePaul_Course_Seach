Weekly homework to turn in, must come to every class to take a quiz and so he can get attendance.  Homework and Quizzes are the easy part. Midterm and Final are very unclear and hard, you will have to reteach yourself because he only reads off of powerpoints.  You WILL need the book to pass THIS class and teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: 304<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Weekly homework to be turned in before class (10%) and weekly in class quizzes (10%) with Midterm (35%) and Final (45%). Powerpoint lectures are useless. Doesn't know how to teach.  No study guide for exams. Doesn't go over hw & quiz problems thoroughly which leaves students confused. Fairly new teacher so take him if you want to teach yourself!!! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take him unless you want to teach yourself!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Night class:  long and not the most interesting. Weekly homework and quizzes. Do the homework and show up for the quizzes and you are guaranteed a 20% in the class. Midterm is 35% of grade and final is 45% of grade. DOES not have office hours so either show up before or after class. Vague as far as what to expect for tests. Study!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: D</div><div id="right"><div>I took his class and the power points were no help, every time I went to the tutoring center half of my class was their getting help. He gave out no hand out to help you for the homework, midterm, or final. You have to teach yourself everything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2014<br>Class Name: AC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Really bad teacher. Does not do anything for you. Not even study guides.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2014<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>He really tries to make everything as clear as possible for you. There is weekly hw and inclass quizes but as long as you do both youll het 100. Midterm and final required alot of studying. A lot of the work you put in has to be done outside of the class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2012<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is hard. More than 50% of the class failed the midterm. He tries to help us out by giving everyone a 100% on quizzes if they are present to take quiz. Theres an infinite # of tries for the hw and they are all due on the day of the final. He seems to know what he is talking about. He is a business man with a career on the side of his teaching.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
