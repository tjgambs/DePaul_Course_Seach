He knows what he is talking about and can be very funny and interesting, but he doesn't seem to put much thought in planning the class so it's pretty much him standing up there and talking. He has a cute accent so its not too bad</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2004<br>Class Name: SHAKESPEAR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really nice and an easy grader.

Always lets you out early, and is a very nice person. Class conversations were interesting, and he motivates students to give their own opinions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2004<br>Class Name: SHAKESPEAR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i was freaked out of taking this shakespeare class but he deffinitely made it as ok as this class could be. he's totaly on top of things and even though he is demanding when it comes to papers, the quizes are hard and yes he is pretty hot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2004<br>Class Name: 328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His Shakespeare class was ok, there is a lot of reading but his lectures were interesting (sometimes).  As far as the quizes, they are extremely simple if you read at least cliff notes. He talks way too much and induces deep sleep.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2004<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree, the class itself is pretty boring, but Chris is probably the best teacher to take something like this with.  His Stratford accent makes it all worthwhile, and he is very knowledgable and willing to go over things with students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ridiculously friendly guy.  However, his class is so boring you want to kill yourself.  If listening to an English man drone on for an hour, explicating Shakespeare passages, then by all means get your ENG 328 on with Gaggero.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher.
