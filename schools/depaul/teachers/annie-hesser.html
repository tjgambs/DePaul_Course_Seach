She makes a three hour night class go by very quickly. Her guest speakers are awesome and the tests are very straight forward and easy. There is one big group project at the end, but if you do the work ahead of time it's nothing to worry about.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thoroughly enjoyed her class due to her approach to the content and the videos we watch.  She has a great personality and is there for any additional help needed.  Make sure to read though because that was my only mistake.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes class fly by. Knows what she is talking about since she has been working in advertising up until this point. Doesn't pretend she's better than her students...huge plus. Just take her you won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far one of the best teachers I have ever had! She makes a 3 hour night class go by fast and keeps my interest the entire time.  Assignments are useful and exams are over material we thoroughly covered in class. She's fun and has GREAT guest speakers.  Because of her, I know what I want to do in the future.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2011<br>Class Name: ADV244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Annie for Principles of Advertising, and although it was her first time teaching a college course, I LOVED IT! She really sparked my interest in advertising Since she is young, she realizes how to teach college-age students. Great professor to introduce you to the major!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
