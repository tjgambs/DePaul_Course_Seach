She has a heavy accent that makes her lectures difficult to understand. She's not fond of answering questions in class and grades homework harshly. She gives a midterm and final study guide that are the exact questions on the tests, but refuses to help you on them, even at her office hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her accent is a lot to contend with, but once you get past that her definitions almost make sense... just ask lots of questions!!</div></div></div></body></html>
