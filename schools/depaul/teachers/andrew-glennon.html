This teacher cannot teach. I studied the book for hours and when I didn't understand something, he would refer me to the book, if he said anything at all. If you care about your GPA, avoid this teacher. This is the only class I've ever recieved a D+ in,and I studied ALOT.

He does not even assign that much homework.

He tends to get defensive and a little condescending when asked a question.  He doesn't grade on a curve and almost everyone in the class was failing.  You really do need to attend class regularly and be disciplined enough to do the homework if you want to get a C- or better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If your quiz grade hits rock bottom and ask him for help, he'll only tell you to &quot;do better next time&quot; and &quot;do your homework&quot; without giving any constructive opinions or actual assistance. Aviod him as he's a suicidal bomber for your grade. The only good thing is attendance is not mandatory since attending his lecture or not makes no difference.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2009<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!

I recommend someone else.Graded on 4 exams (he drops one)and the final. If you need to take 126 and there is no else to take, just wait a quarter and take someone else.

He is OCD, and often times pulls his hair out during class.  He likes to put down students because he has low self-esteem.  He has never been married and has no kids, and has no life.  STAY AWAY FROM GLENNON.  He plays evil mind games.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2006<br>Class Name: MATH<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is tough, but at least he speaks english.

He breaks things down and makes everything easy to understand.  Tests are just like his notes so you dont have to expect any suprises.  Very effective teacher, one of the better Math teachers at Depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2004<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible Teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2004<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A real incompetent.
