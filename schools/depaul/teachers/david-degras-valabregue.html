I thought he was one of the few professors at DePaul who challenged students and as a result, people don't like him. He treats the students like adults and good on him for that. He's not always clear with what he's saying but he'll try to answer any questions asked of him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2013<br>Class Name: MAT526<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible. Lectures were him copying formulas from the book. He clearly made up the class as he went and didn't put time in it. Expects you to know R at a fairly advanced level and didn't spend much time (if any) in class showing you how. Lab time was a waste of time. Unclear guidelines and little feedback. Avoid unless you have no other choice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The final project was a waste of time. A lot of what he asked wasn't covered. He flew through topics the last couple weeks because he went slow at first. That didn't help when it came time to do the project. I'm not sure if he is used to grad students but this isn't a grad level class. Don't take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Degras is a nice guy, and cares for students. However, his class is very challenging compared to other stats professors at DePaul.He flies through chapters, and covers the theory making it difficult for most students.Group project was a nightmare, half of the group project was based on chapters we never covered in class.Not very realistic</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Went slow at the beginning with easy concepts(mean, median&mode) but accelerated dramatically after the midterm when it came to diffucult topics. Quizzes are exact hw problems(45% of overall grade). No final. Two pointless group projects. Final group project is on a GRADUATE level(one of his grad students informed us). Don't take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class started fine but went downhill. Group project was a waste of time. Flew through some chapters only covering theory, did not work many problems. I personally would not take again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I thought Degras was a pretty good professor, he explained concepts well and went at a slower pace for the first couple of weeks. Throughout the quarter, the pace picked up and he started to hammer us with homework (which is quizzed on each class) covering concepts that were not even explained thoroughly.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
