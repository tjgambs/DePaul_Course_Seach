The best take away from the class is to be able to analyze the organizaiton as a holistic entity - a necessary skill for any aspiring exceutive.  This is a high level class.  You won't get a set of equations, however, get frameworks to understand how an organizaiton works as the sum of its parts and how make it succceed!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2009<br>Class Name: MIS798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class and professor!

I highly recommend this course to all MBA candidates.  The class provides you with a comprehensive holistic view of any organization.

Professor Bodine likes to hear himself talk.  He takes tangents that rarely come full circle back to the original point.  The material taught is at such a high level that this class is worthless in the real world.  This class and prof are a must skip.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2008<br>Class Name: MIS798<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't bother with this class/prof.  Took this class earlier this year.  You'll learn nothing.  Spend your hard earned money on something else.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2007<br>Class Name: MIS798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class will give you a holistic view of how a business can efficiently run.
