One of the nicest and most caring proff. at Depaul! Participation matters. He'll let you discuss pretty much anything and doesn't chide you if you're an atheist or despise the church.

If it were possible for a man to be perfect... he might be the one.  Oh, and he is afraid of nothing in a lecture environment ? so take his class now before he gets fired for telling the truth.

He's definitely the most interesting professor I've had so far. The class doesn't seem like a class and he doesn't seem like a teacher. It doesn't feel like a class. It's actually enjoyable and fun, yet you learn plenty.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This Prof rocks.  Although I admit, he doesn't let you know how you're doing in the class, other than that he loves all of us.  He's an awesome prof and really loves teaching you.  He will do anything in his power to help you out (even give you rides home! sort of ...)  He not only teaches you screenwritting but also how to be happy in life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2005<br>Class Name: DCSCREENWRITIN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I have ever had.

He is the funniest, most lively and fun professor on campus.  He is an actual  comedy screenwriter, so this guy knows his stuff.  Homework is treated as the more you do, the better you will be at writing, not so much for grades and such.  Very cool professor, highly recommended.</div></div></div></body></html>
