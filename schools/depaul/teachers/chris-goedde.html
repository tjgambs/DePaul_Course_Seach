You do a lot of readings and small discussion groups and you have four essays. However, he is extremely tough on the essays. I went in for help, and I took his advice but when I got my grade back I only got one point extra. Needless to say, he better really like you to pass the class. Oh the essays are  50% of your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2015<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for my Focal Point class on the Manhattan Project. Super helpful and nice, but class tends to feel long. Lots of small group discussion. Tends to make silence awkward. Difficult essay grader but very helpful when you come in for advice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2013<br>Class Name: PHY311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very engaging group-based teaching style. He uses standards based grading, so if you screw up on a test you can visit him and have it fixed: he only cares that you understand the material, not about test scores.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Goedde is one of those Professors that has been doing this for a long time.  He knows what he is doing, that's for sure.  Compared to other Focal Point classes, there was A LOT of reading and writing, but having completed the course - I feel like I got a lot from it.  If you're REALLY interested in the topic - go for it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: PHY170<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I felt like I self taught myself in this class. The assignments and tests were passable but I didn't feel like I left with a good understanding of the class. When I did ask him questions I didn't get direct answers or I found them confusing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2011<br>Class Name: PHY170<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mechanics is the most important course in the introduction sequence.  Unfortunately, you're expected to learn mechanics on your own without much (if any) help from the professor.  He is intelligent, but needs to refine his teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2010<br>Class Name: PHY170<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard! hard!! hard!!!

Chris Goedde doesn't read books, he stares them down until he gets the answers he wants. When Chris Goedde does a push up, he pushes the earth down. But, Honestly, if you don't take his class, you've missed a chance in a lifetime.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
