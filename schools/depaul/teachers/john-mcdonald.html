Class is not organized well and waste three lectures: exam, presentation, and last week is completely waste. Would not recommend take any of his class, stay away, seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2015<br>Class Name: CSC465<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>The materials of the class is interesting but the Prof. did not organize then well, homework is just a disaster, almost every single homework has wording issue and Prof. sent tons of email to explain, the fact we got more confused. BTW the grader is not responsible at all, took nearly a month to grade a homework. Go take HCI 512 instead.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: GPH469<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A wonderful professor. The class wasn't easy but he is more than willing to help you and answer questions if you take him up on his office hours. He cares about what he teaches and he care about his students if they take the time to ask for help</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2013<br>Class Name: GPH469<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Graphics II, the class picks up follow GPH 321 almost directly. Much better though, everything we learn is directly applicable. McDonald is an excellent teacher, he is very clear and very engaging. Learning this complex topic is interesting and easy with him. Assignments are not too hard yet informative. Exams are great, which is to say fair.</div></div></div></body></html>
