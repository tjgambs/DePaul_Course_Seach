The material isn't as interesting as I thought it would be once we began reading but you have to find a way to make it work. Krell is highly intelligent and has a unique sense of humor. If you come to him with help he will help you, especially if you're a young lady. ;-)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2006<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best profs ever. One of the most knowledgeable and interesting people you'll meet. Students always stayed after class to talk to him and learn more! Read all the materials for class (not hard because they're interesting) and participate. Grades are a couple papers (4-6 pages or something)and weekly 1 page journals about the reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2006<br>Class Name: THEUNCANNY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brilliant man. Likes to hear himself talk. In this three hour class, twice he talked all the way through without a break. Once, someone reminded him to check the clock. Of course, that he spoke all the way through 2 classes without someone saying anything is testament to his brilliance and his engaging attitude. One of the best professors at D-Paul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the best professor at depaul! he really cares about his students and is a very interesting individual himself. There is definitely a lot to learn from this guy. He is funny and classes are never boring. There's always a discussion in class and he will remember you and respect you if you participate.Take him before he retires!

Krell knows all there is to know for this course and is more than happy to spread his knowledge. The readings could get to be a little heavy but he was very reasonable about lightening the load when necessary. Very kind, passionate professor. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: PHL325<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Krell's DERRIDA class was fine. The material is dense but Krell has a gift of making this stuff clear. He draws simultaneously from so many different sources: movies, plays, fiction/non-fiction, TV, LIFE!, and he is able to make you understand more than you thought possible. A remarkable professor and a remarkable lecturer - was not EVER bored!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for a night class and struggled to stay awake. He's a very nice guy but talks for the entire time.  He tends to repeat himself but the material he presents in the class is very interesting.Two papers and quizzes each class  not hard just make sure you participate or else you wont get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Krell is absolutely amazing! He is extremely passionate about philosophy, and it definitely shows in his class. He is incredibly intelligent, caring, outgoing, and motivated. You will learn a lot from his class. Just do the reading and put effort into the papers, and you'll do just fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: GREEKPHIL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Profesor Krell is an incredibly smart, caring , charasmatic man who intrigues nearly all of his students every day.

One of the few teachers I've encountered that does take personal interest in students.  He is a bit self-involved and a bit pretentious.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2003<br>Class Name: GREEKPHIL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His rants are full of interesting tidbits, but are generally very self-absorbed and pre-meditated, as if you are wathching a performance. You walk out of class feeling a little bit dirty and a little bit smarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2003<br>Class Name: GIGATOUR<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class was really interesting and helpful. He's very intelligent, but at times you feel like he doesn't care about the students, but he does. He just wants us to get it done in the correct manner, that's all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2003<br>Class Name: PHL204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is indeed a little of column A, B, and C... as described elsewhere. He is fairly demanding (usually just goes over what you read for HW), but something must be said for the fact that you will learn when in his class... you decide if that's important</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2003<br>Class Name: GIGATOUR<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy.
