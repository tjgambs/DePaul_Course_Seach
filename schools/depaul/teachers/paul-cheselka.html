If you go to class & pay attention the same material is covered on the tests. He really wants his students to do well and goes above and beyond to assist them. He grades fairly easy and encourages students to ask questions. He's a very nice man and great teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2013<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very knowledgeable about Spanish culture and has a lot of fun facts to share about different Spanish-speaking countries.

Conversational spanish with him turned out to be 20 hour and a half lecture sessions on the less than ten page readings. I felt like I was wasting my time going to his class, and in fact feel as though I lost a lot of fluency through taking his class. AVOID.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2011<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear in explaining concepts of the Spanish language, giving examples of points of grammar, and always had amusing comments about the lessons.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2010<br>Class Name: SPAN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty easy for most part. Just follow the syllabus and you'll be fine. That's what I did and I got an A. Only thing he grades harshly on is the compositions. He takes a while to answer emails, but nice about answering questions. If you can take him do it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2010<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cheselka is my favorite teacher at DePaul, took him SPN 101-103, he definitely revived my interest in Spanish.

I haven't taken any other spanish profs, but I heard that he is by far the easiest. Attendance isn't totally mandatory, many people often don't show up or leave early. There are a lot of tests, but one gets dropped. Overall, not bad</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: SPAN102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the previous post.  The instructor seems to talk and talk and talk the entire time, occasionally turning around to write one word on the board then talk and talk.  He tells us to know the entire chapter for each test, however the exams represent maybe half of what is covered.  He does have a goofy laugh.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: SPAN101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perhaps the instructor has changed slightly since the previous students who have rated him, but the instructional methodology used by this instructor is highly questionable. The rational behind every  principle of the Spanish language revolves around a universal &quot;porque&quot; reasoning.  Because&#63;  Really&#63;  That is it&#63; I must vote for avoidance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2007<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If You have to take Spanish, he is the guy to take.

Very flamboyant, yet nice and very interested in Spain and it's lit & history. LOTS of reading required and quizzes quite difficult. He requires a good amount from his students while use of your memory is a necessity. Didn't learn much from the class but needed an old Spanish lit class.  Nice guy though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: SPN313<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The subject was interesting. We went through a lot of books, but you don't have to read, because he went through everything in class. The class wasn't horrible, but I would not take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher for Spanish.

You can tell he genuinely enjoys teaching and as a result, he is incredibly patient with the students.  He does laugh at his own jokes quite a bit, but I think he keeps the class fairly entertaining the whole two hours.  The homework is easy - the tests are easy -always willing to clarify if you don't understand. Take him :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2005<br>Class Name: SPN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great professor to take for spanish</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2005<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. He doesn't give any more homework than other spanish teachers at De Paul. Tests are easy and doesn't take off to many points for mistakes. He is always willing to explain material.
