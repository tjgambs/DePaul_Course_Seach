However, he sometimes forgets that all his students aren't historians too, just be clear with him if you need help or aren't understanding something - he'll listen.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2013<br>Class Name: CTH29201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests are hard.

I had him for LSP 111 and while the class can be a bit dry at times, he is always willing to help you out if you reach out to him. He responds to emails very quickly and is quite straight forward in his teaching approach. You can skip a few classes but explain why and always turn in the work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: CTH290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sane. Completely sane. And extent. What must be done&#63; I, you, we MUST take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: CTHDPU<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too smart for his own good.  I don't think I've heard anyone with quite the same lecture style.  He'll write a bunch of words that he feels are important on the board, followed by a lot of arrows, circles, and connecting lines.  The curve was insane though... I got a B+ for a bunch of D quality work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: CTH206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most stimulating professors I've had. He is extremely knowledgeable in church history and passes that knowledge on to students. Can sometimes be hard to follow during lectures, but you can generally get a picture of what's happening. Really concerned about students succeeding.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: CTH390<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would never recommend him. He has ridiculous lecture style. He covers the whole board in random words from what he's talking about and fills any white space left. Night class is the worsssssssst. You have to read 1000+ pages throughout the quarter of the most boring material. Lastly, his tests are not easy. Tough essay grader. Very self-centered.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: CTH206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very informative. He really makes you learn versus spoon-feed you information. I found tests rather effective, considering I did not know what to expect and thus read the material that was not discussed. Very intellectual guy, I'd definately take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2005<br>Class Name: CTH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His tests are based on the VERY BORING readings.  The class average on the midterm was a 59%.  He is extremely nice, but his tests have nothing to do with the lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: REL214<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class rocks my world...good guy, very knowledgeable and well-rounded with perspectives...he knows all and tells all...please take father ed udovic for god's sake!!! (no pun intended)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2005<br>Class Name: REL214<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm very hard. Was a matching test and it seemed like each answer could have gone with each term. Class average was failing. Otherwise, a very nice and understanding professor. A good deal of extra credit. He is also extremely willing to help students outside of the classroom.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: CTH290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Udovic will recognize hardworking students! Do the extra credits (He wrote 1 or 2 of them himself) If u regurgitate the info u get from his lectures in2 ur final and extra credit papers u WILL get an A.Make sure u study for his tests tho, since there is no homework But i still highly recommend him!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: LIFETIMESVDP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was awsome. Father Udovic is a good teacher, all lecture. Do as many extra possible and its a sure A. A little boring but its worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2005<br>Class Name: CTH290<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was horrible! he isn't every understanding and talks so fast you don't know what he is saying. the final is 50 percent along with the 25 percent paper. I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone who hates relying on tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2004<br>Class Name: CTH290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most interesting professor I had. Wonderful class, very interesting. Do as many extra credits as possible. You will need them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2004<br>Class Name: THEOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This theology class was so easy,if you go to the lectures you know whats on his test. Also he gives a rediculous amount of extracredit. its always nice to get an easy A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2004<br>Class Name: CTH<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2004<br>Class Name: CTH290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fr. Udovic is a very knowledgable and nice teacher; however, his lectures are not very exciting to say the least.  The paper and the final are not that hard...This class was a lot easier than I thought, plus you learn a lot about Vincent de Paul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2004<br>Class Name: CTH290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The St. Vincent class was terrible! The professor was nice, however, never explained the material well. The was one paper worth 40% of your grade and then the final worth 50%. All you do is try to take notes from his BORING lectures! Don't take this class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2003<br>Class Name: CTH290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Life & Times of St. Vincent DePaul was an awesome class!
