He loves to talk. There's a weekly news article you research about, research paper, and midterm / final. As long as you study the questions given for the midterm and final then you should be okay in getting a B or an A. Class itself is SUPER boring. I did homework during his classes. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2015<br>Class Name: LSP 200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't talk much about the readings during class lectures.  I only used my books to answer the review questions for the exams.  But overall he's a very knowledgable professor. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I was excited to take this class and I can say I am very happy I took it with this professor. Weekly two page papers due, midterm and final exam. His own personal experiences really helped during the lectures. I would highly recommend this professor for your multiculturalism class. He is great!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice guy but gives a lot of work for a LSP class. There is a writing assignment every week, midterm, final paper, presentation and then a final as well! He sits in the front of the class and just talks. There is no real structure to the class. He gives you test questions before the midterm and final. Hard to pay attention in class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He just talked about the subject out of memory from research. No homework. Gives midterm and final questions before hand so you just go and write the day of the exams. There is a research paper 10-12 pages. His guide dog is really cute. Easy A. Didn't get much out of the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2012<br>Class Name: PSC319<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was easy, but boring. People took advantage of his disability alot. The final and midterm was fair, and he is a nice guy. I however, would not take a class with him again, didn't feel like I learned much of anything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Im just gonna be honest, i was bored at times in class and so was everyone else, in this class it all comes down to following directions and taking your time to write a good research paper and good article summaries, the exams were in class essays which require some reading. I got an A, but not everybody did.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The sweetest person with much background and knowledge on what he teaches. Attendence is mandatory and the readings correlate to his discussions. Not a difficult class, but I have learned much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Might be the kindest person I have ever met in my life.  He is very helpful and basically gives good grades on everything.  That being said, I hated the class.  I dreaded going because we discussed the same thing each and every day.  It got very boring, which sucked because I really liked the professor.  If you want an easy A, take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, though he doesn't talk about the assigned readings he really tries to push people to talk in class and be open. What a person- incredible spirit and personality, a true gem of a man. Do your work and read to speak up and you'll be okay. Would take again any day.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2010<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Didn't use textbook. Learned more about him than about Middle East. Didn't go to class got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely no structure to the classes, and does not use assigned books which can be very frustrating. However, he is a very charming, intelligent, and kind man! Has a genuine personality unlike many professors.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Charming, likable, intelligent professor. 3 exams (for which you were given a multiple choice study guide with the exact test questions), an 8 page paper, and a few 1/2 page journals. If that strikes you as a lot of work, perhaps you should go back to high school. Lectures don't cover the book, but make for interesting debate. Very interesting prof</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great guy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great lecturer</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really nice guy and good lecturer</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting man. During class he doesn't cover topics in book- he just talks about current issues. suggestion: read the book and take notes for homework, and you can just listen in class. tests: he gives you a study guide and if you take the time to look up the answers- he uses the same exact questions on the test, just in a different order.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>charming man. how could anyone dislike him&#63; he has a disability and handles it very well...its too bad students take advantage</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decent Prof. I would not recommend him however because he rambles in class about the same crap and it doesn't show up on the test. Also because HE IS BLIND people take advantage of his disability. If a 8-10 page research paper plus 3 exams isn't your cup of Tea don't take this man.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME TEACHER, WILL TAKE HIM AGAIN ANY DAY.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unhelpful professor. He talks about nonsence in his lectures and does a bad job going over the book from which he gets his test, thus nobody knows what to study and the tests are hard</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought the class was going to be easy because he rambled in class about random topics all quarter. His tests were KILLER though. I studied for hours and still got a C. Must pay attention to detail when reading. It is a teach yourself class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2006<br>Class Name: POLITICALSCIEN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Being an &quot;adult&quot; returning student I'm really surprised at how ignorant and immature some of the previous comments have been.  Dr. Istanbouli is a great example and should be considered to be an inspiration to his students.  His experiences far exceed most of ours and we can all learn from them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Istanbouli is a decent professor. He doesn't bombard you with great amount of material. We had one midterm test, 6 Articles, 1 final paper and then its presentation. Dr. Istanbouli is very strict on attendance though. So if u're not a morning person then maybe u should consider something else. He's open to question and gives adequate feedback.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2005<br>Class Name: AMERICANO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: AMPOLCULTURE<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the perfect class for the majority of students at DePaul.

Students take advantage of his blindness and show up to class whenever they want, sometimes with only 10 minutes left.  Doesnt go over the assigned readings.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:tjgambs@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
