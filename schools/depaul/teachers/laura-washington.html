Instead, every week I had to teach myself about Bronzeville & the 2016 Olympics which I have no interest in. Nowhere on the course description did it say this class was a special topics class, and that's what frustrated me the most throughout the cours</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2009<br>Class Name: JOUR378<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're interested in broadcast journalism.. do NOT take this class.. Unless you want to work on a specific print type of topic about bronzeville, then this class is a waste if you have better classes to take .. Didn't learn something phenomenal .. Don't take it a night class either ..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: CMN364<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not an easy class by any means.  Although I also didn't like having to go into Humboldt Park, I did learn a lot. Take her if you are willing to put forth effort, because she has a lot to teach. Oh, and don't miss class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2007<br>Class Name: CMN364<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class did not turn out as expected. I thought we were going to investigate stories, not just ONE story the entire semester on the vacant lots. I did not feel comfortable going into Humboldt Park ALONE when the people I was interviewing were telling me there is constant open fire everywhere. What a let down</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2007<br>Class Name: CMN364<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE WORST CLASS EVER.  She does not teach-you will teach yourself. She gave us worksheets, and then sent us into Humboldt park (alone) to blindly knock on doors and find a story about our assigned 10 vacant lots. Oh, your lots didn't result in an earth-shattering story for your final project&#63;  Sorry, too bad. I was so disappointed with this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is kinda like pouring acid in your eyeballs.  You have to go to every class and she makes you go to a freaking 3 and half hour seminar on multiculturalism.  I sort of wanted to kill myself.  Avoid this lady like the plague.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at DePaul.  She is very intelligent, interesting and very accomplished.  If you get the chance, I would definitely recommend taking her.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
