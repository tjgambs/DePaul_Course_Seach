Those interested in art will learn that pilgrims chose to go to the best shrines, so the growing towns on the roads leading to the Holy Land had more than religious motivations to beautify their shrines and churches with the works of art and architecture we see today. Students interested in business will see that the phenomenon of pilgrimage to centers of religious worship created bustling centers of culture and commerce.

A highly contested term, performance is bound to the team role as it relates to sports, theatre, and everyday life. What is your role on the team? What role were you cast in? What is your role in the company? The team role is aligned with function and also with the context in which the \"role is played.\" More than anything perhaps, both sports and theatre deal with highly charged relationships.
