How can they teach us about the city, but also about writing? In this class, students will read, discuss and write about work written by such Chicago writers as Nelson Algren, Gwendolyn Brooks, Stuart Dybek, Sandra Cisneros, Studs Terkel, Marc Smith, and Mike Royko. We will consider the nature of civic engagement and creativity in the literary arts, as well as pay close attention to the formal elements of the poems, short stories, and essays read in this class. We?ll also explore how these texts compel us to think about power and its circulation in cultural as well as social contexts.","tags":"Ann Stanford,31672,location=Loop Campus,ai-credits=2,Ann Stanford,31674,location=Loop Campus,Ann Stanford,31676,location=Loop Campus,Ann Stanford,31678,location=Loop Campus","url": "terms/autumn-2016/classes/ai-143"},

In this course, the student will examine the museum's role as collector, conservator and educator. The student will investigate the traditional role of the art museum, its collection, practices and programs as well as its efforts to integrate new media into its collection. The course also investigates repatriation, which is the ownership of ancient and cultural heritage and other issues that affect the museum such as censorship and funding. Finally it will look at how we value art as a commercial commodity.","tags":"Phyllis Kozlowski,30726,location=OnLine,ai-credits=2,Phyllis Kozlowski,30728,location=OnLine,Phyllis Kozlowski,30730,location=OnLine,Phyllis Kozlowski,30732,location=OnLine","url": "terms/autumn-2016/classes/ai-152"},

In a second step the students will develop the competence to alter their digital photos with a program like Photoshop Elements. They will be able to change the expression of their photos and combine different shots, creating their personal piece of art. As a final product, students will create a portfolio with about 5 photos including detailed descriptions of their work.","tags":" ,30696,location=OnLine,ai-credits=2, ,30698,location=OnLine, ,30700,location=OnLine, ,30702,location=OnLine,Jonathan Gitelson,31300,location=OnLine,Jonathan Gitelson,31302,location=OnLine,Jonathan Gitelson,31304,location=OnLine,Jonathan Gitelson,31306,location=OnLine","url": "terms/autumn-2016/classes/ai-167"},

This course will examine the musical craftsmanship of the Beatles, focusing on their work as songwriters and record makers. Recent audio and print releases documenting the group's performing and recording history provide a unique and detailed glimpse of the Beatles' creative process. We will utilize these materials to closely trace the development of the group's work while using other resources to place it in a larger historical and cultural context. The goal is to shed critical light on this recent chapter in cultural history. That discussion will, in turn, highlight questions about creativity in a modern context where commerce vies with art, technology redefines performance and an emerging global village culture transforms concepts of originality and tradition.","tags":" ,30648,location=OnLine,ai-credits=2, ,30650,location=OnLine, ,30652,location=OnLine, ,30654,location=OnLine,James Kimsey,31204,location=OnLine,James Kimsey,31206,location=OnLine,James Kimsey,31208,location=OnLine,James Kimsey,31210,location=OnLine,James Kimsey,31292,location=OnLine,James Kimsey,31294,location=OnLine,James Kimsey,31296,location=OnLine,James Kimsey,31298,location=OnLine, ,41190,location=OnLine, ,41191,location=OnLine, ,41192,location=OnLine, ,41193,location=OnLine","url": "terms/autumn-2016/classes/ai-185"},

A personal feeling of well-being includes emotional happiness and the rational satisfaction with one's own life. In this course you will attempt to define the term well-being and discover its relationship with other concepts such as mental health and life satisfaction. How does physical exercise influence well-being? How do positive and negative life events influence well-being? Do good social relationships guarantee happiness? Do the expectations one has in life with regard to income influence well-being? Is it important to set goals to achieve a high level of well-being? These and other questions will be addressed in this course. You will try to define some of things a person can do to increase his or her level of well-being. Others' ideas serve as common course content, as presented in the material assigned to this course. You will be asked to participate actively and critically, to work individually and in study groups, using your own experience as a field of analysis and reflection. Active group participation will foster a harmonic, interactive environment, which might increase positive relationships among students and foster a feeling of well-being throughout this course.","tags":"Elizabeth Leavy,30778,location=OnLine,ai-credits=2,Shannon Olison,30780,location=OnLine","url": "terms/autumn-2016/classes/ai-282"},

In this course we will compare and critically evaluate a range of theories about human invention and creativity, both classic and modern - from ancient conceptions of divine inspiration and creative madness to recent hypotheses in the fields of evolutionary psychology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. We will test these theories by (a) applying them to our own past experience with creative endeavors and (b) by determining to what extent the theories can adequately explain the emergence of particular inventions, scientific or mathematical breakthroughs, or works of art. The course will introduce the thought of a range of important theorists on the creative process - from Plato to Freud - and also weigh the contributions and examples of prominent artists, scientists, and inventors, including Archimedes, Newton, Mozart, Milton, Poe, Van Gogh, Poincari, Edison, Einstein, and others.","tags":"David Simpson,30674,location=OnLine,ai-credits=2,David Simpson,30676,location=OnLine,David Simpson,30678,location=OnLine,David Simpson,30680,location=OnLine","url": "terms/autumn-2016/classes/ai-315"},

We will examine options to bring the earth household (ecology) and the human household (economy) together for the benefit of both. This course observes how ?man? is connected to the world around him. It allows us to see our options in response to growing concern over global climate change. Through readings, field trips, activities, discussions and an analysis of our personal use of energy, this course enables us to become increasingly aware of ecological issues. You will learn to evaluate the effect of personal choices on the earth and be introduced to alternative, 'greener' options.

{"title":" HC  253 FAMILY LIFE: THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE OF FAMILIES","text":"In history, families have been defined as mother, father, and children. In our current experience, more families differ from that model than comply with it. Family structure is evolving. Missing fathers, Single parents, and Blended families are only a few of the changes to the family structure that have occurred with some significance beginning in the 1950s. What influences family structure? Do economics and education make a difference? Are race and ethnicity important factors? What about gender, personality and religion? Is the two parent family necessary? What role do grandparents and great grandparents play in the changing family? Perhaps the most important question we can ask about the family is what comes next. What are the many ways in which families might be redesigned in the future? How do these changes impact individuals in society? Competences: H4, H3X, A3A, FX.","tags":"Cynthia Sims,30734,location=OnLine,hc-credits=2,Cynthia Sims,30736,location=OnLine,Cynthia Sims,30738,location=OnLine,Cynthia Sims,30740,location=OnLine","url": "terms/autumn-2016/classes/hc-253"},
