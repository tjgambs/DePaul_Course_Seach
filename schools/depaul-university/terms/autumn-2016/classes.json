This begins by recognizing that educational institutions such as schools and universities are cultural institutions engaged in the making of culture. While the focus of multiculturalism is about theorizing difference in relation to the particular cultural processes that go on in schools and universities, its focus does not address how educational institutions are shaped by broader cultural dynamics that are outside of the immediate context of educational institutions. It is in this context that doctoral students will examine how cultural processes are intimately connected with social relations, especially with class relations, with gender and ethnic divisions, and with the racial restructuring of social relations. They will also explore how culture involves power, which serves to produce inequalities in the abilities of individuals and social groups to define and realize their needs. In addition, culture will be analyzed as a site of social difference and struggle. The primary focus of the course will be to explore how the larger political economy, popular culture and politics of a society effect the dynamics of how culture is constructed within social life. Doctoral students from within this framework will analyze what we mean by culture; how it is produced and consumed; the relationship of everyday life are represented by dominant cultural and sub-cultural groups and institutions. It is in this context that the course also examines how relations of power, knowledge, social identity and pedagogy within educational institutions are conditioned and shaped by the educational practice that shapes and impinges upon the internal workings and purposes of educational institutions.
