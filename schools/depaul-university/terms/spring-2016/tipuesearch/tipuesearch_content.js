Do pharmaceutical companies have a moral obligation to expand global access to life-saving AIDS drugs? Given our ever-unfolding understanding of the human brain, what regulatory concerns ought to accompany the rollout of new, powerful brain-based biotechnologies? Which methods and approaches are needed to make sense of the impact of science and technology on people's lives worldwide? This course is both an introduction to bioethics, -- an area concerned with moral questions related to health, medicine and society ?- as well as a reflection upon the ethical and social implications of rapidly emerging technological and scientific capacities. In this course, learners will learn and use ethical theories to consider and analyze general bioethical issues with special attention paid to the unique challenges that emerge as a result of rapid advancements in scientific and technological knowledge.

We will test these theories by (a) applying them to our own past experience with creative endeavors and (b) by determining to what extent the theories can adequately explain the emergence of particular inventions, scientific or mathematical breakthroughs, or works of art. The course will introduce the thought of a range of important theorists on the creative process - from Plato to Freud - and also weigh the contributions and examples of prominent artists, scientists, and inventors, including Archimedes, Newton, Mozart, Milton, Poe, Van Gogh, Poincari, Edison, Einstein, and others.","tags":"Peter Forster,31303,ai-credits=2,Peter Forster,31304,ai-credits=2,Peter Forster,31305,ai-credits=2,Peter Forster,31306,ai-credits=2","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/ai-315"},

Ecological economics examines how both disciplines need to look toward the other to be viable long term. We will examine options to bring the earth household (ecology) and the human household (economy) together for the benefit of both. This course observes how ?man? is connected to the world around him. It allows us to see our options in response to growing concern over global climate change. Through readings, field trips, activities, discussions and an analysis of our personal use of energy, this course enables us to become increasingly aware of ecological issues.

Unfortunately, when people lack good writing skills, their overall abilities and performance may be questioned. It is not surprising that many professionals, no matter how accomplished they are in their area of expertise, are anxious when they have to write. And, writing often becomes a point of contention when people on the job don't agree on whether a piece of writing is effective or how to go about improving it. Those who delegate responsibility for writing to others often feel frustrated that they end up having to do the work themselves - a situation that invariably leads to their employees feeling criticized and insecure in their job. Needless to say, the duplication of work effort, the loss of productivity, and the inevitable bad feelings undermine the work environment, often leading to individuals resigning or being dismissed. In fact, according to a recent survey of Fortune 500 executives, poor reading and writing skills is the most frequent reason for dismissal of first-year employees.","tags":"Michelle Greenberg,36598,fa-credits=2,Michelle Greenberg,36599,fa-credits=2,Michelle Greenberg,36600,fa-credits=2","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/fa-133"},

{"title":" SNC  185 THE BEATLES AND THE CREATIVE PROCESS","text":"This course is offered in SNL's online program. Online course conform to University scheduling, but are conducted exclusively through Desire to Learn (D2L). There are no in person class meetings. The Beatles are significant in many ways: they were an unprecedented show business phenomenon; they were leaders of Sixties cultural rebellion; and they stand, for many, as a signal instance of popular entertainment attaining the status of high art. This course will examine the musical craftsmanship of the Beatles, focusing on their work as songwriters and record makers. Recent audio and print releases documenting the group's performing and recording history provide a unique and detailed glimpse of the Beatles' creative process. We will utilize these materials to closely trace the development of the group's work while using other resources to place it in a larger historical and cultural context. The goal is to shed critical light on this recent chapter in cultural history. That discussion will, in turn, highlight questions about creativity in a modern context where commerce vies with art, technology redefines performance and an emerging global village culture transforms concepts of originality and tradition.

Online course conform to University scheduling, but are conducted exclusively through Desire to Learn (D2L). There are no in person class meetings. Jane Austen must have known something about universal truths. Her novel, Pride and Prejudice, which begins with the sentence quoted above, was first published in 1813. Still in print today, it has also been made into at least eleven movies, four of which were released since 2000, including a Mormon and a Bollywood version. In this class, we will read the novel in the context of the gender and class norms at the time Austen wrote her book and then consider how Austen's exploration of universal truths is reinterpreted in more contemporary film versions of this novel. In exploring Austen's creation and the many reinterpretations of her work, we will use both analytic and creative writing assignments as well as class discussion to examine how context informs creativity and how creativity informs analysis. You most definitely do not need to be a creative writer to take this class.","tags":"Nina Kutty,31287,snc-credits=4","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/snc-197"},

{"title":" SW  256 EVERYDAY ECOLOGY","text":"Every week, we learn of typhoons and landslides, floods and hurricanes, droughts and other natural catastrophes. Scientists now agree that the major cause of climate shift is man-made, specifically our use and abuse of global energy resources. In Everyday Ecology we will analyze our energy use patterns and explore practical alternatives. The word ecology originates from the meshing of two Greek words meaning the study of homes. Although the main focus of this course is the individual household, another ?household? we must take into account is the economy. Ecological economics examines how both disciplines need to look toward the other to be viable long term. We will examine options to bring the earth household (ecology) and the human household (economy) together for the benefit of both. This course observes how ?man? is connected to the world around him. It allows us to see our options in response to growing concern over global climate change. Through readings, field trips, activities, discussions and an analysis of our personal use of energy, this course enables us to become increasingly aware of ecological issues. You will learn to evaluate the effect of personal choices on the earth and be introduced to alternative, ?greener? options.","tags":"","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/sw-256"},
