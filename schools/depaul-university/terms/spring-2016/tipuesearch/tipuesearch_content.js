Her novel, Pride and Prejudice, which begins with the sentence quoted above, was first published in 1813. Still in print today, it has also been made into at least eleven movies, four of which were released since 2000, including a Mormon and a Bollywood version. In this class, we will read the novel in the context of the gender and class norms at the time Austen wrote her book and then consider how Austen's exploration of universal truths is reinterpreted in more contemporary film versions of this novel. In exploring Austen's creation and the many reinterpretations of her work, we will use both analytic and creative writing assignments as well as class discussion to examine how context informs creativity and how creativity informs analysis. You most definitely do not need to be a creative writer to take this class.","tags":"Nina Kutty,31283,ai-credits=2,Nina Kutty,31284,ai-credits=2,Nina Kutty,31285,ai-credits=2,Nina Kutty,31286,ai-credits=2","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/ai-211"},

The reality is that not everybody has found a way to engage in their community and make their voice heard. Students will engage in personal and collective reflection to explore their own learning styles and the experiential learning process. They will learn how everyday citizens can organize to make sure the issues that matter to them can be addressed at city, state, and national levels. The course will utilize speakers, discussion, learning journals, readings, action assignments and small group exercises to provide an environment where students can explore their own beliefs and perspectives on social change, democracy, citizenship and the process of government in the United States.","tags":"Elisabeth Lindsay-Ryan,31427,ai-credits=2,Elisabeth Lindsay-Ryan,31428,ai-credits=2,Elisabeth Lindsay-Ryan,31429,ai-credits=2,Elisabeth Lindsay-Ryan,31430,ai-credits=2","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/ai-257"},

A personal feeling of well-being includes emotional happiness and the rational satisfaction with one's own life. In this course you will attempt to define the term well-being and discover its relationship with other concepts such as mental health and life satisfaction. How does physical exercise influence well-being? How do positive and negative life events influence well-being? Do good social relationships guarantee happiness? Do the expectations one has in life with regard to income influence well-being? Is it important to set goals to achieve a high level of well-being? These and other questions will be addressed in this course. You will try to define some of things a person can do to increase his or her level of well-being. Others' ideas serve as common course content, as presented in the material assigned to this course. You will be asked to participate actively and critically, to work individually and in study groups, using your own experience as a field of analysis and reflection. Active group participation will foster a harmonic, interactive environment, which might increase positive relationships among students and foster a feeling of well-being throughout this course.","tags":"Shannon Downey,31345,ai-credits=2,Elizabeth Leavy,31346,ai-credits=2","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/ai-282"},

Do pharmaceutical companies have a moral obligation to expand global access to life-saving AIDS drugs? Given our ever-unfolding understanding of the human brain, what regulatory concerns ought to accompany the rollout of new, powerful brain-based biotechnologies? Which methods and approaches are needed to make sense of the impact of science and technology on people's lives worldwide? This course is both an introduction to bioethics, -- an area concerned with moral questions related to health, medicine and society ?- as well as a reflection upon the ethical and social implications of rapidly emerging technological and scientific capacities.

{"title":" CCH  116 PSYCHOLOGY OF MALE DEVELOPMENT","text":"This course focuses on the development of boys from infancy through adulthood within socio-cultural context. We therefore address in addition to gender, the impact of race, ethnicity, class and related issues of societal /governmental failures when it comes to non-voting children. We cover why boys have more trouble at school, more problems with anger, and more incarcerations than girls or boys of higher social class, but our focus will be on their capacities and how those in power can help them thrive rather than present obstacles in their path from birth onwards. In my work in Chicago schools from Englewood to Rogers Park, I found young boys and teens very capable of caring and empathy but not reinforced by adults to develop these skills. This course suggests ways to change that and help teachers, parents and society not stereotype boys or give up on them so early in life. We will focus on how boys can develop fully as men of character and care, who can succeed in relationships, as parents, at work and in their community. We will learn of advocacy work to convince society to improve the conditions in which boys live. We draw upon the work of the Search Institute, the book ?The men they will become? by Eli Newberger (free online) and other current research.

Scientists now agree that the major cause of climate shift is man-made, specifically our use and abuse of global energy resources. In Everyday Ecology we will analyze our energy use patterns and explore practical alternatives. The word ecology originates from the meshing of two Greek words meaning the study of homes. Although the main focus of this course is the individual household, another ?household? we must take into account is the economy. Ecological economics examines how both disciplines need to look toward the other to be viable long term. We will examine options to bring the earth household (ecology) and the human household (economy) together for the benefit of both. This course observes how ?man? is connected to the world around him. It allows us to see our options in response to growing concern over global climate change. Through readings, field trips, activities, discussions and an analysis of our personal use of energy, this course enables us to become increasingly aware of ecological issues. You will learn to evaluate the effect of personal choices on the earth and be introduced to alternative, 'greener' options.

Unfortunately, when people lack good writing skills, their overall abilities and performance may be questioned. It is not surprising that many professionals, no matter how accomplished they are in their area of expertise, are anxious when they have to write. And, writing often becomes a point of contention when people on the job don't agree on whether a piece of writing is effective or how to go about improving it. Those who delegate responsibility for writing to others often feel frustrated that they end up having to do the work themselves - a situation that invariably leads to their employees feeling criticized and insecure in their job. Needless to say, the duplication of work effort, the loss of productivity, and the inevitable bad feelings undermine the work environment, often leading to individuals resigning or being dismissed. In fact, according to a recent survey of Fortune 500 executives, poor reading and writing skills is the most frequent reason for dismissal of first-year employees.","tags":"Michelle Greenberg,36598,fa-credits=2,Michelle Greenberg,36599,fa-credits=2,Michelle Greenberg,36600,fa-credits=2","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/fa-133"},

We cover why boys have more trouble at school, more problems with anger, and more incarcerations than girls or boys of higher social class, but our focus will be on their capacities and how those in power can help them thrive rather than present obstacles in their path from birth onwards. In my work in Chicago schools from Englewood to Rogers Park, I found young boys and teens very capable of caring and empathy but not reinforced by adults to develop these skills. This course suggests ways to change that and help teachers, parents and society not stereotype boys or give up on them so early in life. We will focus on how boys can develop fully as men of character and care, who can succeed in relationships, as parents, at work and in their community. We will learn of advocacy work to convince society to improve the conditions in which boys live.

Embedded in this enterprise is evidence of an emerging political discourse that upends the compulsory scripts ascribed to black masculinity. Hip hop puts forward a set of sophisticated counter-narratives that repurpose the anger borne out of the systematic alienation of black men from attaining the full promise of American masculinity. The course will investigate the ways commercial hip hop facilitates the (re)production and dissemination of black American masculinity post-1965. Students will examine the sociohistorical and socioeconomic conditions from which rap emerges and continues to derive inspiration.

As examples, these conversations can include: confronting an uncooperative coworker, assessing alleged wrongdoing by a student, addressing resistance in a patient, or meeting the needs of a disgruntled customer. In these situations, our own behavioral and verbal actions are important determinants in the direction, duration, and consequences of the interaction. Given the potential for us to be verbally accosted, hostilely confronted, and/or be inappropriately blamed, we often have to manage our own emotions in addition to trying to engage in facilitative dialogue. Students will examine the processes involved in emotionally volatile situations including how our emotional and physiological state work in these situations.

To some, it is a curse manifested in economic outsourcing, destruction of the rain forest, exploitation of low-wage workers by multi-national corporations, human rights violations, and environmental degradation. Proponents, however, would argue that globalization, a phenomenon that has been going on since recorded history, has produced great benefits to many around the world. Why has a word that has been in our English vocabulary for little more than the past 40 years recently become such a polarizing term, often a focal point of hostile passions that have erupted in violent protests?

{"title":" SW  366 EXPRESSIVE ARTS THERAPY","text":"This course offers a multi-arts approach in which different art modalities are woven into the therapeutic process as appropriate to a client's situation. It is grounded not in any particular techniques or media but in the capacity of the arts to respond to human suffering. Various arts--poetry, movement, drawing, painting, journaling, improvisation, music, and sculpture--are used in a supportive setting to facilitate growth and healing. Expressive arts processes have been used successfully in almost all psychotherapeutic contexts, ranging from work with the severely ill to the facilitation of human growth and potential. There is a growing use of the arts in health education, hospice work, and in community art projects especially after catastrophic events. The class will be conducted in a workshop format in which theoretical content will be combined with experiential learning. Lecture, discussion, audio-visual presentation, experiential exercise, guest speakers, and field trips comprise the structure of the class.","tags":"Joan Cantwell,31441,sw-credits=2,Joan Cantwell,31442,sw-credits=2,Joan Cantwell,31443,sw-credits=2,Joan Cantwell,31444,sw-credits=2","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/sw-366"},
{"title":" SW  367 LEISURE, RECREATION, AND HEALTH","text":"This course will stimulate your thinking about the meaning of leisure in your life. Leisure today and historically has been central to the human experience. It is an elemental experience, essential to the total well-being of every person; it is a reflection and expression of the cultural values of a society; it is an important vehicle for treatment. Leisure and recreation services are also essential for healthy communities in terms of social climate, environmental quality, and economic stability. Leisure services comprise one of the largest and fastest growing industries in the world, whether measured in dollars spent, persons served, hours of time devoted, or resources used. The study of leisure and recreation is a broad discipline, combining diverse fields of study and professional practice. This course will (1) illustrate the importance of leisure to you and your loved ones, (2) contribute to your ability to become an informed consumer of leisure, (3) question the binary relationship of work and leisure and, (4) teach you how to use leisure to increase emotional and physical health, resulting in a higher quality of life. The course will be interactive and participatory.","tags":"Shannon Downey,31347,sw-credits=2,Shannon Downey,31348,sw-credits=2,Shannon Downey,31349,sw-credits=2,Shannon Downey,31350,sw-credits=2,Shannon Olison,31667,sw-credits=2,Shannon Olison,31668,sw-credits=2,Shannon Olison,31669,sw-credits=2,Shannon Olison,31670,sw-credits=2","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/sw-367"},
