{"title":" CCA  172 MAKING POEMS: AN INTRODUCTION TO VERSE","text":"Making poems will be a creative writing offering that teaches metrics and verse forms, poetry the old-fashioned way. Topics will include metric feet, rhyme, lines, and verse forms. For example, students will learn about the iambic foot, write some iambic lines of various lengths, and finally use the iambic line to write a sonnet. Rap poetry with its structured rhythms and elaborate rhyming is another possibility. This formalist approach promotes a kind of creativity that is strongly infused with craft and discipline in contrast to the spoken word or confessional approaches to making poems. This class involves making audio recordings of your poems; students will be required to purchase a headset/microphone and download and install free software.

{"title":" CCA  185 THE BEATLES AND THE CREATIVE PROCESS","text":"The Beatles are significant in many ways: they were an unprecedented show business phenomenon; they were leaders of Sixties cultural rebellion; and they stand, for many, as a signal instance of popular entertainment attaining the status of high art. This course will examine the musical craftsmanship of the Beatles, focusing on their work as songwriters and record makers. Recent audio and print releases documenting the group's performing and recording history provide a unique and detailed glimpse of the Beatles' creative process. We will utilize these materials to closely trace the development of the group's work while using other resources to place it in a larger historical and cultural context. The goal is to shed critical light on this recent chapter in cultural history. That discussion will, in turn, highlight questions about creativity in a modern context where commerce vies with art, technology redefines performance and an emerging global village culture transforms concepts of originality and tradition.

{"title":" CCH  116 PSYCHOLOGY OF MALE DEVELOPMENT","text":"This course focuses on the development of boys from infancy through adulthood within socio-cultural context. We therefore address in addition to gender, the impact of race, ethnicity, class and related issues of societal /governmental failures when it comes to non-voting children. We cover why boys have more trouble at school, more problems with anger, and more incarcerations than girls or boys of higher social class, but our focus will be on their capacities and how those in power can help them thrive rather than present obstacles in their path from birth onwards. In my work in Chicago schools from Englewood to Rogers Park, I found young boys and teens very capable of caring and empathy but not reinforced by adults to develop these skills. This course suggests ways to change that and help teachers, parents and society not stereotype boys or give up on them so early in life. We will focus on how boys can develop fully as men of character and care, who can succeed in relationships, as parents, at work and in their community. We will learn of advocacy work to convince society to improve the conditions in which boys live. We draw upon the work of the Search Institute, the book ?The men they will become? by Eli Newberger (free online) and other current research. We will view workshops including feminist Judith Jordan's Raising competent and connected boys and learn of local and national efforts to support young boys development.

The first assumption is that language and culture are inseparable. As students learn the French language, they will also gain insights about the French and Francophone people and their culture. The second assumption is that language is for communication. Studying a foreign language does not mean memorizing grammar rules, but internalizing these rules so that learners can use them as guidelines when they attempt to express themselves in spoken and written French. The course also centers on the explanation of cultural aspects of French life, especially as they differ from American life.

But the role of strategy is to guide organizations in competitively defining and meeting market/society's needs. Sustainable strategies take into account multiple perspectives by engaging in practices - principally systems thinking - to pursue opportunities in meeting market/society's needs that are economically viable, socially just, and operate responsibly within the constraints of a finite ecology. Students will demonstrate the literacies required to develop sustainable strategies that take into account all facets of the business venture (marketing, finance, management, design, production and distribution/life cycle analysis.) One key question will shape the trajectory of the course: 'How does one develop a competitive sustainable strategy to serve some market/society need?' Therefore, the focus of this course is for the student to select a need, determine the sustainable economic system to develop and deliver the product/service, and write and present the 'business case.'

We cover why boys have more trouble at school, more problems with anger, and more incarcerations than girls or boys of higher social class, but our focus will be on their capacities and how those in power can help them thrive rather than present obstacles in their path from birth onwards. In my work in Chicago schools from Englewood to Rogers Park, I found young boys and teens very capable of caring and empathy but not reinforced by adults to develop these skills. This course suggests ways to change that and help teachers, parents and society not stereotype boys or give up on them so early in life. We will focus on how boys can develop fully as men of character and care, who can succeed in relationships, as parents, at work and in their community. We will learn of advocacy work to convince society to improve the conditions in which boys live. We draw upon the work of the Search Institute, the book ?The men they will become? by Eli Newberger (free online) and other current research.

{"title":" HC  171 ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IN ACTION","text":"What is organizational culture? Culture is the way things are done in the organization, a system of shared symbols and a variable that focuses on causality. In this course, you will examine what organizational culture is and how knowledge of culture provides a way for gathering information to help leaders/managers improve organizational performances. This course provides a hands-on approach to learning to read organizational cultures and using that cultural knowledge in symbolic management, training, organizational change, building effective teams, supporting diversity, and unleashing creativity. In terms of cultural analysis, through this course, you will be introduced to qualitative research methods, field observation, interviewing, qualitative surveys, content analysis, and other methods of textual analysis. The textbook is an applied workbook to supplement and apply organizational theory. It answers two central questions: How to understand the intangible culture that is so important to working in an organization, and how to use this cultural information. Finally, you will have a chance to transform theories into practice.","tags":"Dorothy Balabanos,36771,hc-credits=2,Dorothy Balabanos,36772,hc-credits=2,Dorothy Balabanos,36773,hc-credits=2,Dorothy Balabanos,36774,hc-credits=2","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/hc-171"},

To be successful, leaders must be able to interpret complex cultural contexts and develop intercultural competence, not only in themselves but in the people they lead and the other organizations they work with. Developing intercultural competence is an ongoing endeavor that requires stretching one's thinking to adopt new cultural perspectives regarding others' values, attitudes and behaviors. But it is not an end in itself: intercultural competence is the basis for successful social interactions and business communications, which are especially important in today's flat world. Global Leadership at Home and Abroad will explore the demand for and ways to develop this distinct skill set among leaders so they can establish communities and initiate change across diverse groups of stakeholders.","tags":"Charlene Blockinger,31663,hc-credits=2,Charlene Blockinger,31664,hc-credits=2,Charlene Blockinger,31665,hc-credits=2,Charlene Blockinger,31666,hc-credits=2","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/hc-212"},

{"title":" HC  217 HIP HOP AND THE POLITICS OF DIFFERENCE","text":"This course is a study of gender and contemporary popular culture. Few can deny the influence hip hop exerts; however, what began as party music in the late 1970s has matured into a global cultural enterprise. Embedded in this enterprise is evidence of an emerging political discourse that upends the compulsory scripts ascribed to black masculinity. Hip hop puts forward a set of sophisticated counter-narratives that repurpose the anger borne out of the systematic alienation of black men from attaining the full promise of American masculinity. The course will investigate the ways commercial hip hop facilitates the (re)production and dissemination of black American masculinity post-1965. Students will examine the sociohistorical and socioeconomic conditions from which rap emerges and continues to derive inspiration. Students will be guided through a careful reading of Judith Butler?s Performative Acts and will use the work to wrestle with the ways commercial hip hop?s consensual relationship with global capital complicates the project of black humanity fomenting a politics of difference.","tags":"Joy Boggs,31724,hc-credits=2,Joy Boggs,31725,hc-credits=2,Joy Boggs,31726,hc-credits=2","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/hc-217"},

As examples, these conversations can include: confronting an uncooperative coworker, assessing alleged wrongdoing by a student, addressing resistance in a patient, or meeting the needs of a disgruntled customer. In these situations, our own behavioral and verbal actions are important determinants in the direction, duration, and consequences of the interaction. Given the potential for us to be verbally accosted, hostilely confronted, and/or be inappropriately blamed, we often have to manage our own emotions in addition to trying to engage in facilitative dialogue. Students will examine the processes involved in emotionally volatile situations including how our emotional and physiological state work in these situations. Students will learn a framework to more effectively manage the situation in order to arrive at an acceptable outcome. This course is appropriate for those in human resources, patient- and service-oriented industries, counseling, education, leadership development, and other settings where facilitative dialogue is necessary.","tags":"Joseph Chen,36741,hc-credits=2,Joseph Chen,36742,hc-credits=2,Joseph Chen,36743,hc-credits=2,Joseph Chen,36744,hc-credits=2","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/hc-222"},

Are leaders influenced and formed by time and place or are great business, humanitarian and political leaders born to their destiny? What characterizes a good leader in our interconnected world and what leadership lessons can we learn from the past? Globalization has become the buzzword of the early 21st century. To some, it is a curse manifested in economic outsourcing, destruction of the rain forest, exploitation of low-wage workers by multi-national corporations, human rights violations, and environmental degradation. Proponents, however, would argue that globalization, a phenomenon that has been going on since recorded history, has produced great benefits to many around the world. Why has a word that has been in our English vocabulary for little more than the past 40 years recently become such a polarizing term, often a focal point of hostile passions that have erupted in violent protests? What exactly is globalization? Where did it come from and who led us here? Why is it seemingly everywhere? What do we need to learn and do to thrive as citizens and leaders in the global community? These are just a few of the questions we will address in Contextual Leadership.

Therefore, even though the paper will be focused on the applied work that the students are conducting in their community health setting, this document should also incorporate various elements of the didactic courses that have been taken within the MPH program. The exact format and length of the paper may vary depending on the nature of the applied experience, but should include the following general sections: I. Community Health Profile and Background II. Statement of the Targeted Health Issue (including specific health determinants and/or risk factors) III. Description of the Health Intervention or Program IV. Evaluation or Monitoring Plan and Results V. Implications of Findings VI. Future Directions (including future funding of health initiatives) Students should have an outline project approved by the instructor of the Capstone Seminar prior to writing the final product.

Students will learn significant myths and the names and functions of the most important characters in them. They will investigate how the ancients used traditional narratives and images to explore, explain and experiment with ideas about themselves and their surroundings in those contexts. Learning about how myth is variously interpreted (as for example by means of theories of myth-interpretation) as well as basic methods of literary criticism (e.g., analysis of language, content, structure, etc.), students will employ ways to identify, understand and interpret the different types of communication present in myth-literature. As they move chronologically through the ancient world students will observe how myths change to reflect differing individual and collective concerns, as well as the specific interests (and so the significant aspects of discourse) of authors and audiences as conditions change. Students will also learn about literary genres, including poetry, tragedy and prose, their properties and distinctions and discover how genres also reflect audiences and times. Students will read and evaluate modern views of myth in order to understand how myth is open to multiple interpretations and upon what sounder bases myth is to be interpreted. While analyzing myths' diversity in various forms of literature, students will come to comprehend what mythology meant to the ancients, as well as those facets and ingredients of myth that are universal, enduring, and meaningful today.","tags":" ,34266,mol-credits=4, ,34267,mol-credits=4, ,36922,mol-credits=4","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/mol-210"},
{"title":" MOL  211 ANCIENT GREEK AND ROMAN EPIC","text":"This course centers upon the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey and Vergil's Aeneid and endeavors to place these epic poems into their historical, social, and cultural contexts. Students will learn the definition of epic as a literary genre and discover how this genre evolved to reflect audiences and times. They will learn the components of epic language, in particular, literary devices and structural features (e.g., formulas, nested stories, epic similes). They will be able to describe the plots of the three epics and know the main- and mid-level human characters, gods, and goddesses. They will be able to define and better understand the meanings of hero and heroism. Students will be able to express mature appreciation for the epics as whole works. Learning how the epics are variously interpreted as well as basic methods of literary criticism (e.g., analysis of language, content, structure, etc.), students will employ these as ways to understand and interpret the poems. As they read, learn and evaluate modern views of the epics, students will also acquire better means to distinguish critically between views and interpretations. A strong emphasis in this class will be upon the vital connections between past and present, and how students can become more aware of and understand important lasting concepts such as heroism, leadership, self-definition, etc. Finally, students will relate these stories to modern story-telling in order to understand how the heroes of the ancient Greeks live with us today. In short, they will interpret what epic poetry offered ancient listeners and what it has to teach modern readers. The classical tradition is rich with meaning and significance, even to modern 21st century adults and this class will not only be an exploration of the culture and instruction of the ancient world through epic, but an investigation of what classic motifs remain with us today.","tags":" ,34476,mol-credits=4","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/mol-211"},

Students are challenged to regard satire as a critical force. Students encounter comic dramatists with special interest in how the most serious material--war, death, injustice, suffering--is criticized in a way that they can enjoy. With the help of comic theorists students will explore the boundaries of the comic, the social and political function of comedy in different cultural contexts, and the varieties of humor: mad, cathartic, aggressive, destructive, defensive, celebratory etc. Students will confront a host of related issues such as the nature of tragic pleasure, the language and metaphors of humor, and the legal limits of satirical discourse.","tags":" ,34268,mol-credits=4","url": "terms/spring-2016/classes/mol-213"},
