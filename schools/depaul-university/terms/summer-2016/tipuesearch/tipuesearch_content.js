In this class, we will explore all the above issues and related topics, such as the treatment of the poor in every country. Students will be encouraged to suggest research topics within the scope of the class. Our concentration will be on United States and Western Europe?s monetary practices and the effects that they have on social and governmental policies. Since we live in a global world, the influence of other countries on our monetary system and economy will be examined. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the European debt crisis of the PIIGS(Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain), clearly show how our stock markets react to problems in Europe. The Middle East conflicts affect the price of our oil. All of these activities are driven by the lack of or acquisition and choice in spending money. The definition of just what is morality will be our starting point.

How does physical exercise influence well-being? How do positive and negative life events influence well-being? Do good social relationships guarantee happiness? Do the expectations one has in life with regard to income influence well-being? Is it important to set goals to achieve a high level of well-being? These and other questions will be addressed in this course. You will try to define some of things a person can do to increase his or her level of well-being. Others' ideas serve as common course content, as presented in the material assigned to this course. You will be asked to participate actively and critically, to work individually and in study groups, using your own experience as a field of analysis and reflection.

We will test these theories by (a) applying them to our own past experience with creative endeavors and (b) by determining to what extent the theories can adequately explain the emergence of particular inventions, scientific or mathematical breakthroughs, or works of art. The course will introduce the thought of a range of important theorists on the creative process - from Plato to Freud - and also weigh the contributions and examples of prominent artists, scientists, and inventors, including Archimedes, Newton, Mozart, Milton, Poe, Van Gogh, Poincari, Edison, Einstein, and others.","tags":"Peter Forster,40094,location=OnLine,ai-credits=2,Peter Forster,40095,location=OnLine,Peter Forster,40096,location=OnLine,Peter Forster,40097,location=OnLine","url": "terms/summer-2016/classes/ai-315"},

Scientists now agree that the major cause of climate shift is man-made, specifically our use and abuse of global energy resources. In Everyday Ecology we will analyze our energy use patterns and explore practical alternatives. The word ecology originates from the meshing of two Greek words meaning the study of homes. Although the main focus of this course is the individual household, another ?household? we must take into account is the economy. Ecological economics examines how both disciplines need to look toward the other to be viable long term. We will examine options to bring the earth household (ecology) and the human household (economy) together for the benefit of both. This course observes how ?man? is connected to the world around him. It allows us to see our options in response to growing concern over global climate change. Through readings, field trips, activities, discussions and an analysis of our personal use of energy, this course enables us to become increasingly aware of ecological issues. You will learn to evaluate the effect of personal choices on the earth and be introduced to alternative, 'greener' options.

Antibiotics had been introduced in the 1940's, there was an ever-lengthening list of diseases for which immunization was available, and many world health officials imagined a future free of infectious diseases. Yet, as we begin the twenty-first century, infectious diseases are still the leading cause of death in the world. Why? How do we begin to understand the emergence of AIDS, Ebola virus, Lyme disease or Hantavirus? How can we explain the worldwide reemergence of tuberculosis, a disease that had come close to being relegated to history books? In this online course we will seek answers as we study the nature of microbes and the complex, often interrelated factors that contribute to their ability to challenge us even as we pit our science and technologies against them. We will examine such factors as population growth, urbanization, ecological disruption, human migration and antibiotic misuse.

They participated in public meetings, belonged to labor unions, joined churches, and formed professional societies. These civic structures and habits of involvement empowered citizens to believe they could make a difference in their communities and laid the groundwork for some of the major social movements of the second half of the 20th Century. Civil rights, second-wave feminism, gay rights, and Latino rights all have their roots in the 1960s and continued their work over the following decades. In this class, we will explore civic engagement through the lens of our recent history. We will look at how these movements developed and analyze how they achieved their goals. We will take lessons from our predecessors and apply them to our own efforts to make a contribution to the lives of people in our local, national or global communities.","tags":"Christine Fojtik,40607,location=OnLine,hc-credits=2,Christine Fojtik,40608,location=OnLine","url": "terms/summer-2016/classes/hc-118"},

It will then review the American Constitution, the nature of a federal system, and specific topics in American law.

Americans have become disconnected from both the production of our food and from the joy of eating it and suffer from food related health problems such as diabetes, obesity and eating disorders.

This experiential class moves beyond specific dietary guidelines by presenting concepts and skills that will help you reframe your connections with food. We will explore the multiple dimensions of food and eating from an individual, community and national level. We will explore the true meaning of nourishment. Topics include: identifying personal eating styles, mindful eating exercises, the slow food movement, locating Chicago food deserts, a field trip to a popular Chicago organic garden/restaurant, guest speaker from a Chicago restaurant mural artist, examining types of hunger and nourishment, and issues involving food and ritual, food and story, food and psychology, food and art.

Meanwhile, local and regional expressions of Christianity reflect the influence of the cultures with which they have interacted.

We will also consider the impact of the rejection of modern values by some believers, which has led to profound divisions within many Christian denominations.
