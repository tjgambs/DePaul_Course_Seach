These inventions, once unknown and now taken for granted, required years of imagining, experimentation and innovative thinking. While we value the end product, we are often uncomfortable with the creative/creating process. This process of imagining, conceptualizing and articulating the new? requires skills we often label `creative?. This class will explore the role of creativity in the development of entrepreneurial skills and the entrepreneurial personality. Creativity in this course will be seen both as a learned skill and as an exploration of our intuition. Contemporary ideas about creativity are often tied to images of the past - from mad scientists to mystical muses. But modern science tells us something else about the creative mind. This course will explore contemporary approaches to the creative process based on the human capacity to imagine, to explore and, ultimately, to create. These are core skills for anyone pursuing a career as an entrepreneur or simply in search of ways to explore innovation.","tags":"Patrizia Acerra,23566,ai-credits=2,Patrizia Acerra,23567,ai-credits=2,Patrizia Acerra,23568,ai-credits=2","url": "classes/ai-170"},

We will cover a mix of material from psychological and, especially, neuroscientific fields.  Students will also be introduced to the field of neuroplasticity, which is revolutionizing the way we understand the functioning power of the brain.  Neuroplasticity, in simple terms, is the brain's ability to rearrange its connections and, therefore, its functions based on experiences.  In other words, the brain has the capacity to literally change itself, based on experiences, to achieve positive results.  The goals of this course are to understand how the brain works, examine its impact on our daily actions, study how aging impacts brain functioning, discover the learning and adjustment potential of the brain, and apply the principles of the 3 P's.  We will use numerous examples to understand the brain, including health, work, relational, and personal settings.  Students will ultimately answer the question of whether they will have an aging or reengaging brain.","tags":"Joseph Chen,26485,ccs-credits=4","url": "classes/ccs-219"},

Scientists now agree that the major cause of climate shift is man-made, specifically our use and abuse of global energy resources.  In Everyday Ecology we will analyze our energy use patterns and explore practical alternatives.  The word ecology originates from the meshing of two Greek words meaning the study of homes.  Although the main focus of this course is the individual household, another ?household? we must take into account is the economy. Ecological economics examines how both disciplines need to look toward the other to be viable long term. We will examine options to bring the earth household (ecology) and the human household (economy) together for the benefit of both. This course observes how ?man? is connected to the world around him. It allows us to see our options in response to growing concern over global climate change. Through readings, field trips, activities, discussions and an analysis of our personal use of energy, this course enables  us to become increasingly aware of ecological issues. You will learn to evaluate the effect of personal choices on the earth and be introduced to alternative, 'greener' options.","tags":"Barbara Ridd,26289,ccs-credits=4","url": "classes/ccs-256"},

Yet, as we begin the twenty-first century, infectious diseases are still the leading cause of death in the world. Why? How do we begin to understand the emergence of AIDS, Ebola virus, Lyme disease or Hantavirus? How can we explain the worldwide reemergence of tuberculosis, a disease that had come close to being relegated to history books? In this online course we will seek answers as we study the nature of microbes and the complex, often interrelated factors that contribute to their ability to challenge us even as we pit our science and technologies against them. We will examine such factors as population growth, urbanization, ecological disruption, human migration and antibiotic misuse. In 1996 the Director-General of the World Health Organization announced, We stand on the brink of a global crisis in infectious diseases.

{"title":" HTHC  525 NARRATIVES IN HEALTH CARE","text":"Focusing on the performance and narrative paradigms of communication studies, the course will survey uses of performance and narrative methods to consider health communication relationships. Narrative and narrative performance are sites of health communication issues for marginalized populations, difficult conversations, and alternate means of reporting. For example, narrative and narrative performance are increasingly being used as part of medical curriculum, as a means to train health care professionals to understand the experiences of their patients, encourage deep listening, and foster different professional-patient relations. For cancer, HIV/AIDS, and other patients, performance becomes a means of speaking into mainstream and dominant discourses of health and to actively shape discourses from their own subjectivities. This increases the visibility of health care experiences in their gendered, sexualized, and racialized dimensions. Finally, narrative and narrative performance offers an additional means of visibility in catalyzing change in public, legislative, scholarly and relational arenas.","tags":"William Baglia,25966,hthc-credits=4","url": "classes/hthc-525"},

While these gender roles have evolved over time, women and men today still struggle to meet these expectations and they have largely defined who we are for centuries.  We have more choices and freedom to renegotiate and transcend these roles now than at any other time in history, and yet they still impact every aspect of our lives.   This course will explore how gender can influence communication patterns, leadership styles, negotiation skills, conflict styles, work/life balance expectations, relationships and a multitude of other aspects of our life at work and at home. Students will demonstrate the competencies through class participation, group projects, journal entries and other assignments that will allow them to apply course readings, films, and discussion to their own personal experience.","tags":"Elisabeth Lindsay-Ryan,26520,hc-credits=2,Elisabeth Lindsay-Ryan,26521,hc-credits=2,Elisabeth Lindsay-Ryan,26522,hc-credits=2,Elisabeth Lindsay-Ryan,26523,hc-credits=2","url": "classes/hc-178"},

We will explore creative ways to significantly enhance our comfort level speaking effectively in front of groups.  In an open, friendly, fun, enthusiastic and supportive environment, participants will be introduced to a variety of methods to become much more confident with public speaking.Since fear of speaking is the most significant roadblock to giving effective presentations, this will be a focus of the class.  We learned to feel this fear from our conditioning, which gave us disempowering values, beliefs and thoughts about this activity.   These values, beliefs and thoughts, which we subconsciously inherited and adopted as our own, are likewise responsible for everything else that is or is not working in our lives.   Understanding this power of our minds and our ability to implement new, more empowering values, beliefs and thoughts, is critical to creating the life we desire.This public speaking course will use Personal Development as the instrument to improve our ability to speak in front of a group as well as identify shortcomings in our personal and/or professional lives and develop a plan for empowerment to make significant changes in these areas.Student will have an opportunity to speak at each class as there will be 3 short prepared speeches and impromptu speaking during other sessions.","tags":"John McLaughlin,26474,hc-credits=2,John McLaughlin,26475,hc-credits=2,John McLaughlin,26476,hc-credits=2","url": "classes/hc-221"},

Yet the reach of money goes far beyond what we experience. Money is much more involved in the inner workings of the economy through the interaction of financial markets (bond markets, stock markets, foreign exchange markets, etc.) and financial institutions (banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds, etc.). Financial markets and institutions everywhere, and particularly in the U.S., influence the trillions of dollars that flow daily worldwide. Their impact on the welfare of nations and on the capacity of the economy to produce goods and services becomes evident when one looks at the Great Recession, which started in 2008.

Meanwhile, local and regional expressions of Christianity reflect the influence of the cultures with which they have interacted. This course will identify some of these varied expressions of Christianity and will explore the development of modern culture both as a consequence of, and a reaction to, the dominant role of Christian beliefs and practices in many European cultures. We will also consider the impact of the rejection of modern values by some believers, which has led to profound divisions within many Christian denominations. The course will investigate how Western Christianity may have contributed to the various cultural phenomena that are associated with globalization.

{"title":" MOL  210 CLASSICAL MYTHOLOGY","text":"This course is an interdisciplinary blend of the classical traditions of myth, literature and philosophy, concentrating on myth. It endeavors to place Classical literature into its historical, social and cultural contexts. Students will learn significant myths and the names and functions of the most important characters in them. They will investigate how the ancients used traditional narratives and images to explore, explain and experiment with ideas about themselves and their surroundings in those contexts. Learning about how myth is variously interpreted (as for example by means of theories of myth-interpretation) as well as basic methods of literary criticism (e.g., analysis of language, content, structure, etc.), students will employ ways to identify, understand and interpret the different types of communication present in myth-literature. As they move chronologically through the ancient world students will observe how myths change to reflect differing individual and collective concerns, as well as the specific interests (and so the significant aspects of discourse) of authors and audiences as conditions change. Students will also learn about literary genres, including poetry, tragedy and prose, their properties and distinctions and discover how genres also reflect audiences and times. Students will read and evaluate modern views of myth in order to understand how myth is open to multiple interpretations and upon what sounder bases myth is to be interpreted. While analyzing myths' diversity in various forms of literature, students will come to comprehend what mythology meant to the ancients, as well as those facets and ingredients of myth that are universal, enduring, and meaningful today.","tags":"Matthew Baumann,21138,mol-credits=4,Matthew Baumann,21139,mol-credits=4,Giancarlo Tarantino,21136,mol-credits=4","url": "classes/mol-210"},

Students will learn the definition of epic as a literary genre and discover how this genre evolved to reflect audiences and times. They will learn the components of epic language, in particular, literary devices and structural features (e.g., formulas, nested stories, epic similes). They will be able to describe the plots of the three epics and know the main- and mid-level human characters, gods, and goddesses. They will be able to define and better understand the meanings of hero and heroism. Students will be able to express mature appreciation for the epics as whole works. Learning how the epics are variously interpreted as well as basic methods of literary criticism (e.g., analysis of language, content, structure, etc.), students will employ these as ways to understand and interpret the poems. As they read, learn and evaluate modern views of the epics, students will also acquire better means to distinguish critically between views and interpretations. A strong emphasis in this class will be upon the vital connections between past and present, and how students can become more aware of and understand important lasting concepts such as heroism, leadership, self-definition, etc. Finally, students will relate these stories to modern story-telling in order to understand how the heroes of the ancient Greeks live with us today. In short, they will interpret what epic poetry offered ancient listeners and what it has to teach modern readers. The classical tradition is rich with meaning and significance, even to modern 21st century adults and this class will not only be an exploration of the culture and instruction of the ancient world through epic, but an investigation of what classic motifs remain with us today.","tags":"Michael Gutierrez,21137,mol-credits=4","url": "classes/mol-211"},

In Everyday Ecology we will analyze our energy use patterns and explore practical alternatives.  The word ecology originates from the meshing of two Greek words meaning the study of homes.  Although the main focus of this course is the individual household, another ?household? we must take into account is the economy. Ecological economics examines how both disciplines need to look toward the other to be viable long term. We will examine options to bring the earth household (ecology) and the human household (economy) together for the benefit of both. This course observes how ?man? is connected to the world around him. It allows us to see our options in response to growing concern over global climate change. Through readings, field trips, activities, discussions and an analysis of our personal use of energy, this course enables  us to become increasingly aware of ecological issues. You will learn to evaluate the effect of personal choices on the earth and be introduced to alternative, ?greener? options.","tags":"Barbara Ridd,24020,sw-credits=2,Barbara Ridd,24021,sw-credits=2,Barbara Ridd,24022,sw-credits=2,Barbara Ridd,24023,sw-credits=2","url": "classes/sw-256"},

{"title":" THE  213 SCI-FI AND OTHER GENRE FICTION IN THEATRE","text":"Science Fiction, Horror, Fantasy, and Superhero as genres of fiction are prevalent in popular culture and successful (almost saturated) in Film, Television, Prose Literature, Graphic Novels, and other forms of storytelling media. Why, then, are they underrepresented in the world of the theatre? And why are the few more well-known examples of these genres in theatre so often unsuccessful, commercially and critically? How can these genres translate to the stage successfully?  Which technical characteristics of the theatre and of the theatrical language of storytelling are advantages and disadvantages for bringing these genres to life, as opposed to the other media in which they are more prevalent and successful? This course will attempt to answer these questions by examining extant theatrical works of genre fiction and their financial successes and critical receptions. We will also examine critically-acclaimed pieces of genre fiction in other media to determine whythose pieces were successful and how to translate that success to the stage.","tags":"Jason Fliess,25411,the-credits=4,Jason Fliess,25411,the-credits=4","url": "classes/the-213"},

Ethical Decision-Making in the Theatre assumes two basic questions:  What is an ethical decision, and why is ethics of particular resonance for theatre professionals?  Through readings, writing assignments, and class discussions, this course will work to define ethics by examining examples of both ethical and unethical behavior, will examine the ethical role that theatre plays in our society, and will debate the responsibilities that we carry into the profession as theatre artists and professionals.  Through group work we will determine a framework for ethical thinking and will apply this framework to specific situations facing the theatre profession today, ultimately determining whether or not the result is an ethical decision.","tags":"Narda Alcorn,25425,the-credits=4","url": "classes/the-214"},
{"title":" THE  215 PLAYS ABOUT SPORTS","text":"There is a curious relationship between sports and theatre; that is to say, the inherent theatricality of sports and the inherent athleticism of theatre.  A significant component in this relationship is the concept of performance and what that entails.  We speak of high-performance cars and trucks, we applaud and then discuss, blog, and tweet (sometimes to an extraordinary degree) the performances of both athletes and actors, we talk about academic performance, we see performing seals, dolphins, and whales at Shedd Aquarium, a member of the clergy performs a wedding ceremony, and the list continues.  A highly contested term, performance is bound to the team role as it relates to sports, theatre, and everyday life. What is your role on the team?  What role were you cast in?  What is your role in the company?  The team role is aligned with function and also with the context in which the role is played.More than anything perhaps, both sports and theatre deal with highly charged relationships.  In the plays that we will examine in the course, it is the sport itself that serves as both the context of and trigger for the relationships that are created, strengthened, weakened, or in the worst-case scenarios, totally shattered.","tags":"Louis Contey,25426,the-credits=4","url": "classes/the-215"},

We will explore how the practice of improvisation creates opportunities for connection, creativity, and spontaneity.
