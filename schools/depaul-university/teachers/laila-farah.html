She never went thru the syllabus & is SO unclear about hw instructions. Then she grades however she sees fit, not according to her guidelines she previously gave. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. Do yourself a huge favor & take it with any other prof! If it wasn't too late, I'd drop it. She is nice but an inadequate prof</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I took "Women in Chicago Theatre" for my Chicago Quarter requirement with Dr. Farah.  She wasn't there most of the time.  When she was there, we had insightful lectures and discussions about feminism.  I always kind of felt like I could say the wrong thing at any given moment because of the subject and her knowledge of it, but feedback was good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2013<br>Class Name: WGS200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very passionate, as well as intelligent.

She challenges peoples'common misconceptions in a level headed and kind way.

Dr. Farah is interesting and nice, but if you don't do the readings, you won't get anything out of this class.  She rarely covered any important material in class and mostly just talked about herself.  She also assigns alot of homework and attendance is mandatory.  She is very passionate, just unorganized.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: WMS200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible class!!!!  The class was full of feminist who were so full of themselves it was laughable, she herself wasn't that bad, but she never bothered to stand up for students with different opinions and basically allowed immature girls with too many outrageous opinions run the class.

She comes off at first as a very strict teacher, but is actually pretty awesome.  I didn't agree with her on lots of her views, but she always makes good points and really knows her information.  The work load is kind of excessive, but easy to do.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: WMS200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is amazing.
