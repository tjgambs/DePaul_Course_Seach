He can't communicate well at all and half the class failed the midterm and he did not care or see a problem. He also makes rude remarks that are not warranted, like being rusty at math is like forgetting how to read. DO NOT TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>John &quot;Greek Pete&quot; Cashy wasn't too hard. Sometimes was a little crabby. ISP is not a very hard class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER!! In the name of everything holy, dont put yourself through the agony! He's the  worst teacher Ive ever had; he actually instructed us on how to move the decimal point to make a percentage, yet taught logarithms like they were 2+2=4. If you miss class, he won't let you make up the in class assignment& doesnt take late work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a fool. Ever see Anchorman&#63; You know the retarded guy&#63; That is this teacher. He would do the problems wrong as he taught them to the class. He was not the nicest guy i've ever met, though i feel like he was somewhat of a pushover. All in all, i disliked every minute spent in that class.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
