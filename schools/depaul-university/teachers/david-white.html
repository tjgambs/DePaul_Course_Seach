Throughout the class, the only assignments are three papers of about 900 words each, so its very doable. I highly recommend him for his teaching skill, and he also can be pretty funny occasionally.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2014<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. White guides you through 3 major types of philosophy with a paper for each section. Very straightforward guidelines. Participate in class and try on papers and you should be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good & competent prof. Knows his subject matter & will challenge students to think critically abt what he is teaching them. Took him yrs ago and still find myself mulling over things he taught us. Very passionate and intelligent.You have to read to pass so if you don't its your own fault. Youre in college, stop complaining about your homework.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2012<br>Class Name: PHL202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is a very easy workload-often you dont have to read readings because he explains everything in class. BUT its not an easy A by any means. class grade comes down to 3 papers. He grades too hard on papers for not giving specifics to go by. Get 1 or 2 bad paper grades & your whole grade is ruined. He wont give extra credit no matter what.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2012<br>Class Name: PHL202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont take class unless you are a PHL major. He forgets that nonmajors are in his class too. You can get away with not reading much, but the lectures are SO BORING.
