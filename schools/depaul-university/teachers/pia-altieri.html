	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

Quizzes are hard. Alot of readings. Last two weeks of class she goes crazy with assigning all this stuff. Students teach the class not her because she makes every student steach the class atleast once with what she class as the daily respondent.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>just like everyone said... she writes in a very weird way... unorganized.... if you dont want to do a lot of buzy work then this is not the class for you..... class at first may seem easy but in the last 2 weeks she piles on a lot of work... papers... as well the quizzes are very hard....</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the class is simple, but she's EXTREMELY disorganized. also, pictures may have been OK in her college notes, but they're foreign for most students. means well, but needs a new job. biggest gripe = weekly reading guides. one list at the beginning of the quarter would be far more appropriate. i'm convinced she's making the course up as it goes along.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very,very unorganized....very nice and sweet but needs to be a little bit more oranized for the curriculm</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>everyone is complaining about her notes.. they are bad BUT she means well. You can easily get an A or B if you do the work (and its not hard work like everyone is saying) the quizes however, you MUST do the reading AND ITS NOT HARD READING.its short and you go over EVERYTHING in great detail in class so you'll be fine. Id take her for another class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so weird! The class seems like it will be easy at first, but then she gives out tons of readings and hard quizzes.  Also...she grades essays with pictures! strange..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dont get afraid about the low scores this woman has. she is easy. shes like a little kid; she draws picture on the board isntead of notes, so instead of learnign half the time we are playing pictionary. and like previously stated, if you get a tree drawn at the end of your paper, that means you got an A. shes an interesting character. i love norm</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice woman but I have yet to learn anything.
