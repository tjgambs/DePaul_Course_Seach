Engaging.  Funny awesomeness.  Great for a requirement and will enroll in another with Dr. O.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2014<br>Class Name: REL287<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't expect to learn much from this requirement.  But the professors energy and interest in the subject made me want to learn.  She is an amazing teacher who is encouraging and pushed us to do our best, and acknowledged our efforts in the course.  Surprisingly she taught me a lot and as a result I actually think about topics in everyday life.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2014<br>Class Name: CTH248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this class at first but then it took over my life.  Her reading assignments were ridiculously long and she didn't seem interested in helping me out whenever I asked questions (which is kind of the point of online courses).  If you don't want to be extremely stressed then do not take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: CTH248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I am not a Catholic. This course on happiness allowed me to examine the nuances of not just the history of the Catholic church, but of Catholic Faith itself as an Agnostic observer. The readings have been enlightening. All of our papers encouraged me to engage our readingviewing materials in a creative, intellectual, complex way.  She's great.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2014<br>Class Name: CTH248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>There was a lot of work to be done. She was also rather rude if you fall behind. She does tell you what you can do to improve after you've already done the work. I wish I took another course. At first it was easy to relate to but that was the first 2 weeks. After, unless this is your major, I doubt you will find it that interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2013<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>It was tough to keep up with the material but this was an incredibly interesting class, with very little focus on religion (a plus to me). Prof was very organized and easy to get ahold of when I needed to ask a question. Great class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is super nice and friendly. There are a lot of readings , and you need to pay attention because the class is a seminar so there's a lot of talking. There are no tests but papers. It's not a bad class if you're willing to do some work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: CTH248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. O was really great. What she expected out of her students was very clear and as long as you did the assignments you would do good in her class. I highly recommend her, she is funny and super nice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: CTH205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This instructor was the perfect combination of informative, enjoyable, and controversial. I learned more from this professor than most the professors I have had for my other learning domains at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2013<br>Class Name: CTH246<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Overmyer is one of my favorite professors thus far in college. My major is completely unrelated to Christian studies, but she was able to make the material aplicable to so many different subjects. I wouldn't call the class easy by any means, but she really wants you to succeed. Definitely get out what you put in.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2012<br>Class Name: CTH246<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At the beginning of the quarter, I did not really like this class, BUT I came to love it. We watched a movie every class which is great. The readings are long, but she takes the time to explain them in class. There is NO MIDTERM, two 5 page papers, and an ORAL final. Take it if you're up for the challenge :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: CTH190<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did not think this class was easy at all! I defanately worked for the grade but loved this class. Loved Dr. Overmyer. She made the material easier to understand and really interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2011<br>Class Name: CTH246<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Overmyer was a really good professor to have for Christian Ethics.  You watch movies for half of almost every class, she gives no midterm.  You have to papers that are easy, and an Oral final which she helps you prepare for the whole time.  TAKE HER.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
