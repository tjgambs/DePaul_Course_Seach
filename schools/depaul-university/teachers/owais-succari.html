Quite relaxing class considering it's 8 hour. A big solo presentation and 2 tests. Read the book & listen to his lecture! Participation counts a lot! All in all, easy class and funny professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2014<br>Class Name: MGT357<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is easy but he takes off points randomly which can be annoying. I aced the tests (as in 99%+) but he would shave points off participation and presentations with no explanation. I was literally 1.3 points away from a an 'A'. He does this often. But besides that it was alright.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2013<br>Class Name: MGT357<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor and class.

Do not take him!!!!  The class is extremely boring and all he does is sit at the desk and read from the textbook.  Also, he takes points away from your test with no notice or explanation.  DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2013<br>Class Name: MGT357<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class. Midterm and final are open book/open note online. There is a presentation on a country he assigns you, but it's really easy and it's only for like five minutes. His lectures are really boring though, so you would have to get through a three hour lecture even though it's an easy class. Overall, cool guy and an easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2012<br>Class Name: MGT357<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rambles in lecture but he is a very nice man and he is extremely fair.  Every test is open book, you would actually have to try to fail this class, I put minimal effort in and got a B</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2011<br>Class Name: MGT357<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class overall! A few online quizzes and online final exam which is easy if you have read the book and know where to find the answers because he lets you use book and notes. Have to write an outline of a paper researching a country of your choice. Don't have to actually write a paper.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2011<br>Class Name: MGT357<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Class and very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2011<br>Class Name: MGT567<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers at DePaul.

You def need to participate and he takes attendance by taking our picture... He's an interesting man, very funny.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2010<br>Class Name: MGT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although one professor essentially stole my degree over twenty years ago for my final paper, Owais remains a fond memory for me, and I recall his words and allegories fondly. I ran into him as I lived near him after my time there; helpful as always. I always loved his class. Open your mind, and he will fill it with real world wisdom.

Impossible to follow his random lectures. Completely random grading. Also, got a 94% overall which is an A-. You need a 95% for an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: MGT355<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is pointless.Professor has no authority.He asks students if they want tests or papers.Doesnt grade very fairly on final paper.Class has no structure.It would have been better if he just decided things on his own rather than doing what the class wanted.This was supposed to be an easy class, but professor complicates it as a result of inclarity</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2009<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him twice.  Definitely hands down one of the best professors at DePaul.  He cares about you and your success.  Reasonable assignments and tests.  Forgets a lot of the standard college BS.  Good world view.  Likes to joke.  Enjoyed going to Executives Club breakfasts.  TAKE him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice, loves joking around.

If you can't handle this class then you should not be going to Depaul.

Professor Succari has many worldly experiences and is a good professor for this class.  He is also very helpful.  On the whole, the class is not very difficult.  He provides class time to work on your research paper even though I think he only reads the footnotes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good professor. but boring class. always talking the stuff from the book. but if u don't wanna learn much, just take him and get a easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2008<br>Class Name: MGT357<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great teacher.

Quizes are on blackboard, but they can be triky. If you are not satisfied with your grade, go to his office, and TALK to him... Attendance is sort of mendatory, but for good grades, you gotta participate at least twice a class... Other than that, he is good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>no midterm, no final, all exams are online and straight from the book.  grades on class participation so answer a few questions and you will get an a</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, no complaints here. Just go to class or if not he will take away the online quizes and you'lle have to do them in class. Trust me, our class learned this the hard way. Other than that, take him for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, so yes, he def did change his teaching style. His lectures have nothing to do with the quizzes. All quizzes are online, from book, but are pretty hard. Sorta nice b/c he doesn't believe in memorization. I guess i would recommend him...just expect a B</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2007<br>Class Name: IB540<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't learn anything. The entire class revolved around writing a paper that wasn't assigned in the syllabus. And not even the content of the paper, but research methods and proper citation. The worst MBA class I have taken - complete waste of time and money. Felt like I was back in H.S. English writing a term paper.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2007<br>Class Name: MGT535<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class, but an easy A. I admire that the Professor does not believe in memorizing information, he believes in learning.
