I had to spend most of my time doing work for this class, than all my other classes and let me say I have Bio 7 hours a week. She's a nice professor but expects way too much. And since she is typically an English teacher she's a tough grader on papers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please do not waste your time!

Class isn't an easy A - she will make you work and improve your writing (But isn't that the point&#63;)  Quizzes are easy if you do the reading; papers are graded moderately hard, but not unreasonable.

Class is very boring though... Doesnt make you feel like you have a lot of homework but the research paper is EXTREMELY tedious.  She is also a very very very hard grader.

Yes, she's a tough grader. Get over it. If you really want to improve your writing, take her.

Her voice annoyed me and she graded fairly hard on 2 page papers we had.Offers rewrites that often don't change your grade much. Only assigned one book to read for the class.

This class required 5 books which all needed to be read from cover to cover in order to pass the quizzes which were very easy if you read. Class was easy because I read and the bigger tests and papers were easy as long as you know how to BS your way through it. I would recommend if asked to comment about it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was easy!!!

Discussion does get a bit boring at times, but Goffman is a sweet, helpful lady in a motherly sort of way.  Papers were graded pretty easily and the pop quizzes actually forced me to keep up my reading. She's not amazing, but not terrible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Goffman's so sweet and runs the class really well.  The whole quarter we all sat in a circle and had discussion time, which made class itself really easy.  She's not too tough of a grader on papers and other than some trivial in-class quizzes, class is a breeze.  She's light-hearted and never stern.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DePaul hit the jackpot with Goffman. You couldn't ask for a better Professor. The all 6 of the books that we read were interesting. The papers were frequent, but easy. Do a draft and let her proof it and you should get an A, if not you're an idiot!!!  I love this lady!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2004<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a tough grader, but you can revise your papers for a new grade- she's very very helpful (she'll read emailed drafts of papers etc.)a very nice woman and interesting book choices</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2004<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her more than I expected to.
