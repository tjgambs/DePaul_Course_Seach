She favors certain students over others. One time she called me out in class because I didn't know a particular tense, since I was a transfer student. She told me in front of the whole class that I was not supposed to be in her class. In a language class you have to feel confident in front of your professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: FCH105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although she is tries to help her students she is very harsh when it comes to grading and when you do corrections she unfairly gives the credit she promises. She's a good person, but not a great prof. Even if you're giving your best if she feels you aren't trying hard enough, she won't give you as much attention or help.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2012<br>Class Name: FCH202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms Kichler is a remarkably skilled teacher. She makes my day a little bit better every day. She is so full of enthusiasm for her subject that you can't help but fall in love with French.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2012<br>Class Name: FCH106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Mme. Kichler for 105 & 106. She is WONDERFUL. She really really cares about her students and their success. If she sees a student struggling she will take her own time to help them get back on track. There were many times when she sat me down after class to help me work through my mistakes and it really paid off. She is perfect.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2012<br>Class Name: FCH105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Assignments are clearly outlined in the syllabus. There is homework every night but she doesn't collect the workbook until the end of the unit. Fairly easy grader. As long as you make an effort, she will help you in everything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: FCH105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an incredible teacher. She loves French and you can tell in class. She always has funny little stories to go along with what we are learning and she is extremely helpful outside of class. She is adorable and a very good teacher. I highly recommend everyone to take her for French.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2011<br>Class Name: FCH202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mrs. Kichler rocks my world.  Before she started teaching me, I could barely utter a word in French.  Now, the language flows off my tongue.  She makes French fun and exciting, and my every day is a joy because of her.  The man that married her is lucky indeed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2010<br>Class Name: FCH106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Kichler knows what she's talking about! She's not the easiest teacher, but learning a language itself is hard. She really cares about her students and their success. If you make an effort, she will know and won't be so hard. Stay on top of work and study well for the tests and you'll do fine!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2009<br>Class Name: FCH104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't like her at first, but Mme Kichler really cares about her students. She can be harsh, but it's only for you own good. She also is SO MUCH MORE OBSERVANT than she lets on. She will notice everything about your french from day one. She is most strict to pronunciation and the spoken word. Shes cute, but very intimidating. STUDY.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2009<br>Class Name: FCH104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher for French. She speaks very clearly and will speak in English if you don't understand. Drops the lowest test grade and lets you do redo tests if you get lower than an 80. Emphasizes speaking a lot. Pascale responds quickly to emails and is very helpful outside of class. I'm taking her next quarter again, definitely recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2009<br>Class Name: FCH202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nicest woman you will ever meet. She demands participation and attendance, but you will learn a lot from her. I enjoyed her class even though she assigned grammar work, reading, movies, and geography projects! She is a great person from whom to learn french.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2009<br>Class Name: FCH106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wonderful professor, super nice and lets you correct compositions. charming accent, and i never use the word charming.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2008<br>Class Name: FRN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really cool prof. She is very easy to understand and the work is not overly difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2008<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy french professor and very nice and sweet. She'll respond to your e-mails. Easy assignments and exams, I think the class average is a B. There are oral presentations and a chapter exam every two weeks but no midterm or final. Offers some extra credit because she really wants to see her students with an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: FCH203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kichler is the best French teacher at DePaul. I would not take another French class without her. She is fair, but if you want extra credit and she knows that you try, just ask.  We had take home tests every week that you turn in over email which were extremely easy. Just finishing the sentence and 2 essays. Just try, GO to class, and PARTICIPATE!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2008<br>Class Name: FCH102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very helpful...i was having problems and instead of referring me to a tutor she addressed them herself...has a wonderful accent and is big on proper pronunciation so practice  that a lot. not too hard a grader...Make sure to participate a lot in class and she'll love you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: FCH202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Madame Kichler is really wonderful.  She is from Switzerland and speaks French beautifully (I almost like her accent better than Parisian's). I have never had a French teacher who was so well organized.  She is very helpful and wants you to succeed in French.  She is big on the whole accent thing, so make sure you say those errrr's properly.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2008<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
