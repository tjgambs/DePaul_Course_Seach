Midterm and final were both open note.  Classroom discussions were very interesting.. Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2005<br>Class Name: REL180<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Assigned way too much reading and as a result class stopped doing the readings altogether. Surprisingly, though, the classes were fairly enjoyable. He'll let you discuss pretty much anything and doesn't chide you if you're an atheist or despise the church, which is antithetical to what I expected. This made for some interesting class discussion.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: REL285<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really sweet guy. Very helpful and intelligent. His lectures were not too bad. He  tries to make things interesting and easy to understand. A really great guy. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2005<br>Class Name: REL285<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the nicest and most caring proff. at Depaul!
