Don's disorganization was almost laughable. He was reading the material in class as he taught! Avoid him for Foundations- it feels like he treats it as if where study hall duty.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2011<br>Class Name: SNC701<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was amazing mainly because i was paired up with the most amazing ladies for our group projects, so i found the class to be fun and enlightening at the same time.

He is too busy with his personal endeavors to be of use</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2007<br>Class Name: MATA201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor, Very Helpfull.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
