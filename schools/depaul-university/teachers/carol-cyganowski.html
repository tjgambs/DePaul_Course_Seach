But because it's too easy, you won't be satisfied. Though, there is very little work to do. It's a good idea to take her if all your other classes are very hard. Her expectations are unclear. You will get bored but you can catch up on your zzzs if you have to pull an all-nighter for another class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this class, it is so boring and she comes off as very stern and not a people person at all! I would not recommend this teacher to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you aren't immediately on her good side, i suggest you drop the class.. i am midway through the quarter and dropping the class because she give me no credit for anything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2004<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome.  Brilliant.  Get to know her.

She gets some kind of warped satisfaction on being as unclear as possible - then skewering you with her grades.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2004<br>Class Name: 367<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Here's a woman who can fool you if you're not careful.  She appears gruff on the outside, but she is brilliant and kind (if you deserve it).  She holds everyone to strict academic standards.  You will learn a lot in her class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2004<br>Class Name: 400<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>intelligent and extremely familiar with the subject.  She's not physically well, but there's nothing wrong with her wit, and she's a great judge of character.  You get what you deserve from her.  Take her, but don't goof around.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: ENG367<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her grading is very abitrary--if she likes you, then you'll get an A or a B and if she hates you, expect lower than that.  Unfortunately, she hated me and I still don't know why, as I am a very respectable, responsible student! Don't take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2004<br>Class Name: ENG367<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>although her expectations are not very clear, her class is extremely interesting.  she has a lot of great stories she can tell...and as far as I can tell, she seems like a people person to me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2003<br>Class Name: ENG400<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RUN!!!
