He had a great line up of amazing speakers, all in different event fields. Only issue is he is unclear about assignments while also being a tough grader.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2015<br>Class Name: MGT519<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>A great class if you want to learn more about the business side of sports.  We had good offsite classes, including meeting Doug Bruno and going to a Cubs game.  Expectations can be vague about assignments.  Overall, a fairly easy and enjoyable class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2014<br>Class Name: MGT356<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Im not a huge sports fan and I was able to keep up with the material. Great class and easy work but he is a strict guy with a no cell phone policy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2014<br>Class Name: MGT356<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Clark is very well connected in the sports community. He knows sports inside and out. The class was cake. Required readings are in SBJ. A few discussion posts, midterm project, final group project, take-home final exam (essay questions), and a few easy assignments along the way. A must take MGT elective in my opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2014<br>Class Name: MGT356<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, well connected and very helpful if you want to pursue a career in sports. I was interested in the topic, so I had an easy time paying attention but I can't see it being terribly boring for most people</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2014<br>Class Name: MGT356<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, great professor. The class was extremely practical, and he had a lot of interesting guest speakers. This class actually advanced my career, too. He can ramble sometimes and is a little tougher than the average grader. You would not regret taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: MGMT356<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly the guy is just ok. He is interested in the subject but there were many times I had to fight not to fall asleep and I am very interested in the subject. The work load isn't that hard, but make sure you ask him about expectations because he grades on guidelines that weren't stated. He's a tough grader with unclear expectations.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
