No documentation stating what is required for the final project or presentation.  Hard to even understand him sometimes watching the class online.   Said there would be a midterm and seemed to forget.  Extremely dissapointed with this class I wouldn't recommend him to anyone</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2015<br>Class Name: IS372<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ironic that he teaches a Software Project Management class because he has trouble managing this one simple class. He grades everything half-hearted and provides poor feedback. Provides no written documentation so if youre an online student you're going to struggle. I think he takes on more than he can handle. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2015<br>Class Name: IS201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yele is pretty entertaining and funny. He can be unorganized at times, which results in assignments being moved. I only used the book about 3 times, seems like he forgot about it halfway through the quarter. Class was very easy, concepts aren't difficult. He can be picky with grading, and sometimes assignments weren't clear enough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2015<br>Class Name: IS372<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unorganized and never responds to emails. We did not follow the syllabus at all, leading us to skip the midterm and the final even though he said we would have them. All assignments have no written documentation so you better watch the lecture in order to get anything he is talking about. I really expected more out of this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2014<br>Class Name: IS201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had a grader look over all assignments, which resulted in never getting a perfect score.  Had to contact him to change my grade for multiple assignments, if he replied that is.  Hard to get a hold of.  Was not in his office whenever I stopped by, and never replied to voicemail messages.  If you can avoid the class, do so.  Not worth the headache.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>This class is has very boring content and she does her best to just get you through it.

For all the unclear comments, if you listen in class he gives you what he wants in the homework.  Being a graduate level course I don't expect to have the teacher hold my hand. The class was geared as in you listen and apply to answer. Really no right or wrong if you can back up your answer.  Great Job!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2012<br>Class Name: PM210<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a joke. Assignments were unclear. When emailing for clarification, numerous emails went without reply (probably 75-80%). The responses I did receive were short with simple "yes" and "no" answers to questions that clearly warranted explanations. One of the worst teachers I have ever experience. I learned nothing and it was horrible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2011<br>Class Name: CS421<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His homework was easy BUT it had errors and sometimes wasnt clear.

My only complaint is not of him but of students who did not give him the respect he deserves. Many will mention his thick accent but if you actually listen rather than complain, he is still speaking English and making complete sense. Very approachable in class, helpful, and knowledgable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2010<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is unclear, thinks he's funny but not really, and will call you out if you touch your computer while he lectures.  I found this class a complete waste of time even though I love web design- he doesn't know how to teach at all.  He needs to fix his teaching methods and learn how to relate to students. group project + tests/quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2009<br>Class Name: ITIS201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

I had a hard time with some of the stuff, but he was pretty lenient on most things. We had like 3 Sarah's or something in the class... and to make it easy he just called every single girl Sarah... it was pretty funny. Go to class.. do the little assignments.. and you'll get an A for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: IS371<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really knows his stuff, and is always eager to answer questions...

The goal was to determine the IT readiness of Brazil via conventional and observational research.  We did site visits and sat through many presentations.  Overall, Yele is an excellent professor and he comes highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2007<br>Class Name: IS540<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>CTI needs more professors like him.  The most challenging things about his assignments are that they require you to think.  If you're not an abstract or conceptual thinker, you won't make it in his class.  He's fair, and does an excellent job in class.  He was the first professor that didn't put me to sleep, and I thoroughly enjoy sleeping in class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2007<br>Class Name: CSC223<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a funny, laid-back teacher.  The material is relatively clear and he is an easy grader, but really seemed to enjoy reading our papers.  But because he has a heavy accent, I had a hard time understanding him on COL; don't take him if you can't go to class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: IPD499<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You should take this class it was my true first international experience.Although he was absent for the class because his wife had a baby.
