Only 2 papers (midterm & final), which basically summarize the course content and what you learned. Easy A without feeling like you wasted time & money.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: PHL235<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, this guy is really hysterical. But the class is ust so so boring... always goes off on tangents... its a complete drag. but the class in general is easy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2012<br>Class Name: PHL204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very insightful man. and he doesnt take himself too seriously, he can make class fun and educational. he talks a lot about his band and bicycling. An interesting dude :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2010<br>Class Name: PHL205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had Bill for existentialism. Yeah, he talks a lot about his life, but it's kind of refreshing in that "let's just all chill out" sense. Very smart. Will talk a lot about philosophy if you seem interested. Mostly, I think he just assumes (correctly) that most of the class couldn't care less about the material. If you're going to pull your own weight and actually do the reading, it's a good class. Only 2 grades though, so a little scary there. Show an interest, and class will be more interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2010<br>Class Name: PHL204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love philosophy and I took a course with him on Existentialism because it's a topic I'm very interested in. I was extremely disappointed with the way Professor Martin ran his class. I learned a lot about him and his life and very little about Existentialism, if anything at all. Huge waste of my time. I do not recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yeah. The person before me explained him perfectly. I like him as a guy but he sucks as a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He talked about his bike & his life, & thats it! When he ACTUALLY tried to teach he never finished a thought.  Worse, There were only 2 grades, the midterm & the final, and he didnt even grade our midterms! His TA, who wasnt even in every class, did ,which is so rude, & the grading was VERY UNFAIR! Id take a different class, unless you like bikes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2008<br>Class Name: PHL345<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>grades on how much he likes you/agrees with you.  be careful and keep track of your grades.  he gave me an incorrect grade for the class until I called him on it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really thought provoking lecturer, and he keeps the class grounded by talking about how everyday exploits may be thought about philosophically. Some people clearly were in here cause they had to be, and they made the class a bit sterile, but other students were way into Dr. Martin!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Martin is a phenomenal professor, and like most philosophy teachers, expects a certain level of discipline when grappling with serious academic topics. With this said, it is not surprising to see that, at a school like DePaul in a required sophomore class, when Martin attempts to incite thought-provoking debate, much of it is left unappreciated.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, this professor is really passionate about his subject. I just hope his readings arent that hard. Im not a major in phil and I have hard time understanding the reading and his words on the board. The Vegan guy is totally unnecessary.Grading is easy. Two papers. Attendance mandatory. Easier reading would be nice so we can understand what he say</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was awfull! A complete waste of everyones time to attend. Although the class was very easy, grading is hard and only based on two papers. This guy should not be a teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Imagine a class where some weirdo professor talks about family guy, biking, and then the ethics of multicultralism and expects you to recognize the subject matter he seemingly doesn't want to talk about.  Don't cross him, though, because his way is the ONLY way, meaning he is going to ignore you and grade your papers with a passive agressive bias</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Martin sure loves to bike. Miles and miles in Kansas. And he'll tell you about twice in every class. I hate this class. Not worth taking notes because anything he writes on the board is so trivial. Theres only two papers.. fairly easy. But you wont learn a thing because he talks about a million unrelated things.Easy...but do not reccomend him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2007<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best professor at depaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2007<br>Class Name: PHL204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class, he sometimes went off on random tangents but was pretty bearable for the most part. Not too hard if you know the basic pretenses of the class, plus he's a really interesting guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2007<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the other people are crazy, he is by far my favorite professor at depaul, and im not even interested in phil or business. he is hillarious and i won't complain that i got the easiest a from his class. ethics is something of discussion, there is no finite answer to what is right and wrong, and that's what he teaches. the other kids were too dense.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bad Bad and more bad...do not take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: BUS248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a waste of time!  Didn't learn a thing about business or ethics (it was a business ethics class).  He had an animal rights activist come in at tell us that we were bad people for donating to the March of Dimes.  Only redeming factor was that I got an easy A.  Don't bother if you are interested in learning anything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: BUISNETHI<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy teacher just show to class you'll get an a.. open book midterm and take home final can't get easier then that</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: PHI248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty cool teacher. This was a very easy class. He doesn't expect much of you at all. Has alot of cool stories about Chess and Biking. He's very cool about just &quot;having a talk&quot; most of the class. Doesn't take attendence. Layed back hippie-type. I'd recommend him, he does know his stuff and it's an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2006<br>Class Name: ANALYTICPHL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know. This guy can't stay focused on the material read, so that if a student is having difficulty understanding the material, he can't help you. Rambles on and on about anything but Analytic Phl. Posing questions to the man has a tendency to annoy him, unless he likes you, then its all wine and roses, If he doesn't care for you-- screwed!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2006<br>Class Name: BUSINESSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy was great!  Seriously, funny as hell and one of the brightest teachers I've had yet.  Very stimulating discussions and out-of-the-box ideas.  Would love to take another class with him.  &quot;Da Bomb Teacher&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2006<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy, he's sorta taken with himself as all professors can be. If you really love philosophy dont take him. He bascialy has no lesson plans. as fun as it is to hear him talk about music and various stories, id rather learn the things im going to be tested on. Like i said nice guy, great if you dont care about philosophy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2005<br>Class Name: BUSINESSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Martin was and interesting and nice guy. He talks about a lot of strange off-subject topics most of the time, and is a fairly easy grader. He dosent mind if you miss class or leave early (I dont even think he notices). I liked his class, you just have to think out of the box a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: PHL202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OK, so he's a litte strange. But he's hilarious. The class was kinda pointless, spent very little time talking about God, but whatever, if you can think outside the box a little, you'll be fine!!!!  You'll score an A easily. Remember this -- the ontological argument is golden as a paper/exam essay topic!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: PHLOFGOD<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher ever! The entire class sessions were spent with Martin talking about his many hobbies & wierd lifestyle habits. He then had the nervers to test us on a book in which we never discussed. I learned nothing about the PHL of God, not even a small insite, but I did learn that Martin loves riding bike & playing chess. I got a B in the class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: PHL202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i dropped 2 bus managemant classes before i had him, i slack off party and still end up understanding what he has to say. he is amazing.... i can't stress it enough. if u have the chance take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: BUSINESSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i loved this class.  he is really easy to listen to for a long time because he is funny.  he is an easy grader as long as you follow along with what he is talking about. he has some good life stories as well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: PHL311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bill Martin is awesome-its bus majors who are stupid.

On your papers, he doesnt want u to repeat what he says in class, which ain't a lot.

It's an okay class based on participation and 2 papers. He's a nice guy, but I wouldn't recommend the class if you could get in a better one. He's kinda funny though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, provided your writing skills are up to par.  Just make sure that you support your claims with the theories studied in class, and it's an easy A.  I'm not sure, however, if he is confusing or if it's just the subject matter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2004<br>Class Name: PHLMGT228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sorry; Bill is awful and you won't learn a thing.  He does not critically analyze the [overpriced] text, nor does he challenge the class to think.
