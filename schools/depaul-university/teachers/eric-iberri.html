The class is never exciting, everyone just want the time pass away fast, he speaks in the monotone and moves awkwardly. Well, he is a nice person for sure but teaching is SERIOUSLY not his niche. He takes forever to get into the point he wants to tell and never care about the students!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worse teachers you could ever encounter. I have had lots of English teachers but non compared to how absurd this guy is. His teaching style is so boring and not interesting at all</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful teacher! Cares so much about his students and will meet with you anytime to give you extra help.

He pretends to make his class funny, but actually he makes it boring. He gives us a lot of homework, very detailed and requires a lot! I learned nothing from hime,just a waste of time!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
