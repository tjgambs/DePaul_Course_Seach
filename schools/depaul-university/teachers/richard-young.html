You do have to read and write A LOT but you will learn something. For those who say he is not clear he makes a point to leave the assignments somewhat open ended to encourage students to explore the subject. He tells you this many times throughout the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: REL110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class, but he is not clear of what he is asking from us. He does not give great feedback. He wants us to understand religion as if we studied it our whole lives.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2008<br>Class Name: REL110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of reading and a lot of writing assignments. Be prepared to spend good 6-8 hours a week doing those, and don't expect to get an A. I did all my assignments, had perfect attendance, wrote a nice final paper and still got a B! He's not very helpful and bit too sarcastic.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2006<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared to work.  A lot of assignments are due but they aren't really hard.  He knows a lot which makes his class interesting. He can be sarcastic but don't take it personally, just laugh at it.  Overall, his class is enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: JUNEXP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher, and can usually get the majority of the class interested in his lectures.  However, he's leaving at the end of the month for a non-teaching position elsewhere.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2004<br>Class Name: MPS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HOT HOT HOT</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2004<br>Class Name: REL204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an awesome teacher.
