Have always been interested in world religions, but never really looked at them from an objective viewpoint until I took this class. Professor Mount makes you feel like your opinions really count and is truly helpful in achieving success. He wants everyone to pass!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2015<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Do the readings. The class is discussion based, so prove you read the homework by participating. It'll also make the class much more interesting, and it will make the writing assignments so much easier if you know what you're talking about. Take notes on the points he brings up during discussion. He's very engaging and I learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2015<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He was so great. This is the honors class I was dreading and it turned out to be one of the most interesting that I've taken so far. He's beyond excellent at facilitating good, unbiased discussion. Such an interesting course and amazing prof. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2015<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I honestly went in with low expectations and Mount really surprised me at how interesting he made the course. Very unbiased and VERY accepting of all opinions. I don't think he ever disagreed with anyone ever. It was either "Yes, and..." or "Fair point, but have you ever thought of it this way?" Reading was never too much to handle.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>lots of reading, 4 writing assignments, nothing else but attend class and discuss readings great teacher, great class. super helpful</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2014<br>Class Name: REL237<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was looking forward to the class, but the professor is pretentious and the class was far more difficult than a 200 level religion course should be. I took it as an elective and found myself spending more time on it than my major courses so I dropped. More work than it was worth, and the online lectures were unbearable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2013<br>Class Name: REL237<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wish I would have seen the comments before I signed up for this online class. Everything is 4 points and he makes it difficult for you to achieve 4 points. Lots of reading to do. I'm sure this class would have been easier in class than online. Just don't take it online...save yourself the annoyance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2013<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I will never take this professor again. His quizzes and final were ridiculously impossible, tons of reading, and paper were difficult to get a good grade on. I'm sure he is a smart professor, but he's not very helpful or good at teaching. My 300 level class was easier than this 200 level. Everything was worth 4 points making it harder to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2013<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'll be honest, I took on in-class course with Prof. Mount and enjoyed it! Now, after taking an online course, I can honestly say I'll never take another of his courses.  The readings were extremely difficult to understand and the pro. was rarely there to answer questions.  The quizzes were also near impossible.  Everything was worth 4 points.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2013<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not what I expected. Tons of reading each week, impossible quizzes, 2 group papers, a final paper, and a final exam. Don't get me wrong, the professor knows alot about the subject, but this class was extremely tough. If you take this class, be prepared to take an extensive amount of notes on the readings and lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2013<br>Class Name: REL238<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had weekly readings of well over 100 pages of scripture, weekly quizzes with questions that are not always answered in the readings, but rather he expects you to interpret scripture in the same way he does. Also, weekly discussion posts that are not always graded fairly. This class will consume all of your time! My advice is STAY AWAY.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2013<br>Class Name: REL237<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's highly educated and interested in what he's teaching and the class was both interesting and very easy. Midterm was all bonus points.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2012<br>Class Name: CTH106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is very smart knows his stuff will teach you a lot but it's weird because he teaches a religion class on Jesus from a histroical point of view but i do not believe he is religous Midterm for extra credit was bogus because he didn't explain what he expected clearly to many txt books for 1 class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2012<br>Class Name: REL238<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor who know a lot about Christianity. If you are looking for an easy class where you don't have to read, this is not a good class for you. Many people complain about reading - well, this is college, you have to read. If you actually want to learn, regardless of your religion or lack thereof, he's great.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: REL238<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is by far my favorite professor. He is so knowledgable and passionate about what he teaches. He keeps class interesting and really changed how I view religion/jesus. I'm not super catholic but i loved this class. Optional midterm (extra credit for final) and final paper. A lot of writing but it's so rewarding and makes you think. Take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2011<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow. many people that comment on this site are really slow and are looking for classes that feeds their stupidity. Mount is an excellent professor. He speaks with clarity, meets students at their skill level, and makes class really engaging. Take this prof. if you want to get your money's worth and not some watered down worthless education.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2011<br>Class Name: REL238<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this class if you are going have any other classes with any other homework. He is passionate but gives way too much reading and you have to write journal responses due every class. Unless you are passionate about this stuff DON'T TAKE IT! its hard analysis work and endless reading along with too many books to buy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2011<br>Class Name: CTH214<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>prepare to read a lot. Wants you to feel the subject the way he does, which is impossible</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2011<br>Class Name: CTH214<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was dreading this class when I fist signed up, however it turned out to be my favorite class this quarter. He really knows what he is talking about and makes class very interesting. Lots of reading & writing but midterm is extra credit. Pretty simple & very interesting class. I HIGHLY recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2011<br>Class Name: REL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His 200 level classes are challenging, but it's college, its supposed to be that way.  The professor goes out of his way to help students who struggle with the material.  His style of teaching is engaging and his lectures are never boring. Take one of his classes, he's among the best teachers at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2011<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DAUNTING CLASS. Have to understand and adopt a lot of his academic jargon to do well on papers. Plan your schedule around it. Journal entries and 70+ pages of reading for every class period and it's obvious if you didn't do it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2011<br>Class Name: CTH214<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was not what I expected.  Rather heretical, considering that DePaul is a Catholic school.  Lectures were great, very dynamic. There's lots of reading and work, but it's interesting at least.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2011<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was definitely work intensive, but it wasn't awful. I learned a lot, but I agree with the rest of the comments. It was challenging. There are three papers and you have to read about 8 books and write responses (2 pages) per class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2010<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is considerably challenging, but that's just it. Any class about religions is going to be tough because the subject matter itself is hard to grasp. I was lucky enough to have a passionate professor like Mount to make it a little easier to understand! My advice, consider that this will be your hardest class and plan the rest accordingly.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2010<br>Class Name: RELIG105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this as part of the honors requirement. This is NOT a blow off class. If you had that in mind, don't bother picking this class. There is daily 1.5 page essays. Lots of reading. The midterm and final paper will require WC help if you want a good grade. The only good things I can say is he's very helpful, will respond to emails. My advice: Pass.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm and Final have nothing to do with the lectures. Papers are IMPOSSIBLE and are unclear. This class will become ur life and you will still get a poor grd.I had a 4.0 at DePaul before this guy (my first B). This guy should not be teaching!!! Talk about a weed out course...
