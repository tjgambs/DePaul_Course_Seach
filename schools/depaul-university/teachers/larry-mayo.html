	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Buy Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />

His teaching is dry and uninspired. The amount of work required for this course was totally unjustified. My peers had zero interpersonal skills, and we were thus forced to endure his monotone rambles for 3 hours every Tuesday night.

Discussion was often tedious and full of awkward silence. His knowledge of the subject matter seemed rather narrow outside of what was in the readings.

I'm not gonna lie, I am kind of a slacker and I still did really well. I loved this class! All you do is watch a movie then answer this sheet with like 4 questions about the movie. You also just have to take notes on discussions that you turn in. I highly recommend taking him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This section was on Urban Multiculturalism.  Dr. Mayo knows his stuff and can be fun in class.  He always asks for us to get involved, but once we;re on a roll, he seems to stop us.

Nice prof. who is very Helpful(if you seek it). He can come across as a bit pompous at times, but its not too bad.

I mean 1 or 2 videos EVERY class only means he doesn't have very much to say. No real issues are probed, although the subject calls for MUCH discussion and deeper understanding.
