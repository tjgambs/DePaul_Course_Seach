Gil is cool, nice and he's really passionate about  his work. But this class seriously made me rethink my decision to add INT as a minor ! There's too many papers to write.

Yes, his classes are challenging but if you grow as a person and an academic. He will rework and open your mind. You'd be lucky to have him as your professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Understanding and helpful, but still demands a lot from students.

Work MUST be put into the class to get a solid grade. I'm an A student, who is having difficulty in his class (B-/C work :/ ) but it is worth it. He preps students  SO WELL for the rest of the major, which is VERY DIFFICULT!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: INT203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor; however, he often makes things too abstract.

At first I thought the class would be so difficult, but as the quarter progressed he unveiled such interesting and thought provoking content. He is the epitome of what a great Professor is. He cares about his students and wants to make a difference.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: INT366<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gott is the GREATEST PROFESSOR AT DEPAUL.

I think some of the more conservative students in the class were offended by many of his opinions. However, he is an extremely intelligent man. The research paper for the class teaches you a lot about your subject. The readings are also very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2007<br>Class Name: INTX<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What an amazing professor.

He is a lawyer and sometimes he does make simple ideas a bit too complicated, but he really knows what he is talking about.  He is very very nice and willing to talk with you.

He allows only one point of view in his classes. Most students allow themselves to be brainwashed, and leave the class thinking they received an education.

He refuses to let anyone have thier own opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: 202203301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers.

Extremely interesting.  Did not have him grade me, but as far as inspiration and intelligence goes, he's really excellent.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a really great professor. i learnt so much in his class. he expects a lot of you, but it isnt unreasonable. enthusiastic, fair and smart. he really encourages you to talk and defend your ideas in class too, which is rad. i really reccommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2004<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's awesome. The INT program shines b/c of him.  My colleagues and I are always talking about how lucky we are to have him. His confidence in students appears out of his expectations of the quality of assignments etc. Be ready to work and open your eyes. He's a great person to have on your side.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2004<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>mean, arrogant, pushy, one-sided, and discouraging. i really hated his class and found him to be downright rude and dismissive of many student's opinions. he is a total liability to the INT program at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2004<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He may seem extremely intimidating at first. Great lectures, very smart man with alot to say, and very helpful if in need of help. Overall a hard grader, do the reading (Hard), write well, participate participate! and u will do good!
