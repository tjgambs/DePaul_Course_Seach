You're in a class of 40 and all she does is talk. When she asks people to ask a question the rooms silent until someone who talks all the time responds. She is very boring. Tons of reading. The finals will tell you if you pass or not. Last minute bummer</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2014<br>Class Name: HST240<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Doody's history of chicago class was a wonderful experience.  I don't think I've learned more in another class during my tenure at DePaul.  Professor Doody is passionate about history and it shows. I'd recommend this course to anyone who is interested in chicago. If you need a history credit, take a Doody class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2013<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great lady and she is really passionate about history. This class with her is not for you if you want a truly high intense amount of reading. The novels were very dry and had a lot of unnecessary information (even stated by Doody herself) but you are forced to read it so you can complete assignments. She requires attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unclear expectations and a very slow grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: HST375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've had at DePaul.

This class is a lot of reading and a lot of writing, but the writing assignments are small and mostly reading reviews. If you keep up, you'll be fine. Participation and attendance is crucial.

She takes quite a bit of time to grade things and personally I feel that she overloads herself with so assignments to grade. Read the books and be ready to discuss and the class is a breeze.  Don't read and she'll know. She's really nice though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2011<br>Class Name: HST240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! it seems like it'll be fine: shes got a decent rating on this website, you already know a good amount about Chicago, and of course her last name is DOODY! But do not be deceived fellow Depaul students, this class sucks. She assigns way too much reading (40-80pgs for every class) and shes boring as s.h.i.t.

She's a pretty easy grader and a very nice lady but unless the subject is fascinating to you, you wont enjoy this class. A lot of reading, but you can still succeed and not read. The books assigned are incredibly boring. At least she is really nice and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2009<br>Class Name: HIST240<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doody was just an okay professor. She obviously knows a lot and wants to be good, but her teaching style is better suited for a high school class. She asks very redundant and mundane questions that are too obvious for anyone to actually answer. She has no tests and scantron quizes and 3 pg papers. Defintiely an easy B but uninspiring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2008<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her Chicago Radicalism course, and while she isn't the most interesting person to listen to for two uninterrupted hours, I certainly learned a lot.

I had her and she was very unhelpful.  She assigned me a paper topic that was impossible to find research on, then looked herself and couldnt find anything, but she wouldnt let me change it.

If you don't plan on doing the work and coming to class she is not the professor for you.  If you are willing to come to class and do the work you will do well.  Doody is very fair and a nice person.  Not a very easy grader but I managed to pull off a B+.  Took alot of effort but still, B+ is good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2007<br>Class Name: HST240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class because I thought that the history of Chicago would be interesting...but she made it extremely boring!

I had her for radicalism in chicago. The class was unmotivated, there were a lot of long silences after easy questions. her paper topics are awful (discuss how the Chicago Historical Society has changed for 7 pages).  She isn't mean, but rarely smiles.  Do all the journals and you'll be ok. It was a lukewarm class for me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2006<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doody was the best.

She was frustrated having to teach an ISP class with a bunch of freshmen that are gonna end up failing out anyway. I really liked her.
