The assignments are not tedious are not very difficult. There were only two tests and he was a merciful grader. I learned quite a bit in his class. Didn't get the book, but my test grades may have been a little bit better if I did. He is always willing to help if you have a problem, and he's just a good guy all around. Great science class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2011<br>Class Name: GEO225<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Nice professor.

His lectures can get pretty boring but that is just because the information is pretty dry. He is funny and an extremely easy grader. The class consists of like three homework assignments, a paper, and three tests. All were really easy. I'd definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2010<br>Class Name: GEO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had know knowledge what-so-ever before taking this class, and he's been a really good teacher.
