She is incredibly smart and definitely the best professor in the program. She is willing to spend as much time as needed helping students outside of class and truly wants everyone to pass. She is amazing!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: NSG322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Margaret is the best professor that I have encountered in this program so far.

She is the smartest, and the most willing to spend extra time until you understand everything.  She may seem intimidating at first, but she just has a very string personality.  She is funny too.  Helps during a 4 hour lecture!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2009<br>Class Name: NURS322<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok so everyone will make you think she is the worst prof. you'll ever meet. But guess what&#63; She is one of the few that knows how to teach and cares if you are learning. Simply amazing,smart,helpful. She is truly knowledgeble and puts her heart and soul into what she teaches. She is a true inspiration!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
