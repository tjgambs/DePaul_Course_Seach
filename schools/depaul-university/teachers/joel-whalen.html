He does NOT want to help you, and he does NOT care about you. Don't be fooled by all these people who talk about how funny he is. He is two-faced. When you talk to him one-on-one, he will treat you like dirt and make you feel so low. Unless you have no choice, do NOT take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2006<br>Class Name: MKT276<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not recommend people to take his class.

He talks all the time, tells stupid jokes and laughs at himself.               The class is very easy and his blackboard slides very helpful. The speeches you give are in the groups. Your grade consists of your presentation and your coaching guides you give other student. This part is tedious and time consuming.

I actually look forward to going to his night class on Monday. Very enthusiastic and you will never be bored. Class is very interactive and we usually get out early.  He is very knowledgeable about his subject.

I think this guy is a pompous ass.  He is very demeaning towards undergrads, and grad students are his favorite.  I did not think his lectures were that helpful.  he's also very strict on attendance.

Not only is he the most effective teacher, but his lectures educate you above and beyond what the course requires.  I will continue to recommend the DePaul MBA program to prospects based on his classes alone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2005<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best class anyone could take!
