She really helped me improve my writing and wanted me to succeed.  I liked the field trips. Most professors wouldn't even try to do field trips with 80 students, but she wanted us to see history in public.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2012<br>Class Name: HST269<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perhaps Public History is just not my subject, but I really didn't like Professor Tyson that much as a teacher. Not at all a fan of the way she conducted the midterm and final, and she was very very one-sided in her presentation of gentrification. She's a very nice person, but I would have benefited so much more had I not taken her class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2012<br>Class Name: HST269<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She treats this class that should be easy, as a grad level class. Way to much readings, you need to have complete knowledge of them for the quizzes. Field trips are on saturday mornings. Mid term project and final are in-depth this class is terrible</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2012<br>Class Name: HST269<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lengthly and dense texts weekly with fairly difficult comprehension quizzes weekly. Attendance is mandatory. Midterm and final paper, no tests. Fairly boring topic if not a history major. Two required out of class field trips. Not the best but not the worst class I've had. If you have a choice to take another history class, I'd advise to do so.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: HST269<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very nice and always has a smile on her face. The material of her lectures isn't always that interesting, but she tries to keep them upbeat. Many of the in-class quizzes were pretty hard, and there's about four readings a week, some pretty lengthy. Overal, glad I had her as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: HST269<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor, I would recommend her to anyone! She is extremely helpful, participation is part of your grade, but I didn't participate once and I got 8/10 on that part. Fairly easy class, pretty interesting too!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2011<br>Class Name: HST269<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Helpful, extremely kind, and not as tough as she lets on. Prof. Tyson rewards creativity and hard work and does her best to accommodate the needs of everyone in the class. The only thing to beware of is the out-of-class field trips; they are fun and informative but this class may not be for those with a crazy schedule.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2010<br>Class Name: HST389<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knowledgeable, quirky, straightforward, always helpful, one of the nicest professors that I have ever met....and quite cute!

More work required than any other class, although that doesn't mean it's hard. The hard part was trying to decipher what she expected from us. For one assignment she did not want a typical research report from us, even though the assignment was to write a 'research report essay'. This type of assignment was typical.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2009<br>Class Name: HST269<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The subject isn't too exciting, but she tries to make it fun.

She is extremely kind, cares about her students, and knows her subject matter very well. Although she does give a lot of reading, it isn't hard to figure out what you should read (packet) and what you  ignore(Brinkley textbook). Be sure to go go to class though, although she doesn't grade on attendance, she does keep track!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Why do some of you not like Tyson&#63; She very nice, helpful, and knows her subject matter. Yes, she does give a lot of reading, but you quickly find out what you should read and what you can ignore--focus on the packet and ignore the Brinkley textbook. Be sure you go to class though, she doesn't make you, but she does keep track mentally. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2007<br>Class Name: HIST282<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Huge Advice: Do not buy textbook. Ive never opened it and never will. You take 5 quizzes, 2 lowest scores are droped. 2 papers, and then a final. All guiz questions are from a packet she gives you. Every single class is notes, notes and more notes. She is a decent teacher though, knows her stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2007<br>Class Name: HIST269<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, however teaching is all over the place and very disorganized.  If your looking for an easy A, take her, but if you are serious about learning the subject I would not.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2007<br>Class Name: HST269<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy professor, very nice always willing to help. The class can be tedious and the big project that's due at the end is unorganized but overall the class isn't bad. You have to take 5 quizzes and she takes the top 3 for a grade. The readings for the quizzes are in a packet she gives you and you pay for but no other books than that.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2007<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>loved her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: HST269<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay, but boring material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2007<br>Class Name: HIST269<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Tyson is really the best teacher I`ve ever had. She is truly an amazing person and everyone should be so lucky to get her for a history teacher. She is super smart and really cares about her students. She probably only treats students like 10 year olds if they act like 10 year olds. Besides, she is probably the most beautiful professor ever!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2007<br>Class Name: HIST269<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Actually I think we only had, like, an average of 25 or so pages to read a week... but this class had a lot of whiners in it, which was often frustrating.  Oh well. I liked the class fine, and now think about museums and public history ways I hadn't before.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2006<br>Class Name: HIST269<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think the last comment was a little to harsh. The class was easy but real boring. The proff. treats the students like 10 years olds and thus does not get the respect she would like. The readings were the worst for lack of interest and total length. The proff. is just a teacher who happens to love history and is making a living at it. Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2006<br>Class Name: HST269<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID AT ALL COSTS! SHE GIVES U A HEADACHE AND IF YOU ASK ME SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A THEATER MAJOR AND NOT A TEACHER! HORRIBLE, STUTTERING ALL THE TIME, YOU CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND HER. GIVING 80+ PAGES TO READ A NITE, LADY WE HAVE OTHER CLASSES TOO! GAVE BORING, TEDIOUS PROJECTS WHICH WHERE NO CLEAR AND WHEN YOU ASKED HER A QUESTION SHE COULDNT ANSWER</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: HST269<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great woman, fun personality, just an all around good teacher. If only the material she taught was as fun as her personality. The material is quite boring, but she does everytihng she can to make it fun. Take the class, she's fun! Just get the work done and do the reading and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2006<br>Class Name: HIST101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I knew Dr. Tyson before she was a doctor.  She's an enthusiastic scholar and a dedicated teacher.  Take her class.  You will be deeply impressed by her depth of concern for students, broad command of material and her vibrant teaching style.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
