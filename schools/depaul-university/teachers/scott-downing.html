Most of the assignments should be an easy A as long as you follow his instructions and with the examples in the book. Doesn't like people using their cell phones in class and he will lower your grade on &quot;professionalism&quot; if you don't stop. Overall, nice guy and knows what he's doing</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2009<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best teacher I ever took for any writing class!

He is helpful in discussing assignments and in challenging students to do their best work. If you want to learn something about writing, take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is very boring, and that guy is right about Office Space. Bring Sodoku to class. Otherwise its like a freshman English class. If you know how to write its not that hard. Also he really urges people to meet with him. Follow the templates he gives out because if you follow those you will get an A. Don't buy text!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is sooooo boring. He talks like Bill Lumbergh from Office Space. All in all, this class is not fun. Pretty obvious, which makes it pretty easy. If you compare your writing assignments to the one in the books, you should get an A or B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall nice guy, grades papers pretty hard, would be better teaching middle school students, gets upset when students use bathroom or go out of classroom.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Downing is so easy. His class discussions are boring, but he is friendly. He does have a Southern accent & reminds me of a cowboy.LOL His essays aren't too hard & he's an easy grader too.u have an option of turning in your essay at the due date2 receive feedback or hand it in a week later w/o feedback and u don't get marked off 4 that either.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Downing may be a decent teacher but his attendance policy is obscene. A 2 credit class, and he treats it &quot;as a professional business meeting&quot; being late, missing class all result in destroying your grade even if you get Bs on all assigments.  Bottom line is im not getting paid to be in his class needs to understand his role as a teacher not a boss</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very unpredictable...his grading system sucks...you will never know what your grade is. written homework has to be done his way or he will give you at the most a d or an f...not kidding</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2007<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor! Explains material as clearly as possible. He is very helpful, assigns weekly homeworks, two quizzes (easy!), midterm and final. Gives lots of examples and he's funny as well. I highly recommend him. You won't be sorry if you take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2007<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class isn't that bad because its just paper writing. He is a hard grader though, I thought I deserved a grade higher than he gave on each assignmnet. Night class is boring with him and attendance is mandatory. Not a bad class altogether though, put a lot of time into your paper review!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2007<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher, explains topics well. May confuse what he is saying and need to retract his statements- overall though- teaches well. Tough grader but in a business writing class--- it is to your benefit.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2007<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would only take him as a last option.STAY AWAY!  He is extremely stricty about missing class and being late.  He is very boring and repeats the book as his lectures.  He is often unprepared for his class lectures and retracts what he says and confuses everyone.  Very unorganized.  His quizzes are stupid and pointless.  Arrogant!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was actually practical to the real work world.  Was helpful about papers and was interesting sometimes.  Can be boring but the most useful part were the papers.  Only 4 papers for this class and 2 quizzes.  Very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>oh my god. This class was awful... I dreaded going to it. He takes everything way too seriously and repeats himself way too much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2007<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice teacher, and explains the topics throughly.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really hard grader, although the work really isn't that hard. Getting a B is no problem. Getting an A, well, that takes a little more work. His class basically requires of 3 papers and a final portfolio, in class free-writings, required readings, and loves participation. He's recommended b/c he will make you a great writer; one that is precise.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2006<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for a light summer course and it was an easy B. One hw per week and no quizzes. Assignment were super easy consisting of memos, letters, and a resume. The only thing is that this guy grades pretty hard. No problem in getting a B, but it will be tough to get that A. Still, everyone should take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2006<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy on the surface but I'm telling you, if it's you're ready to grad and gettin' lazy, this class isn't very good for your GPA. Hard grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2006<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>its the stupidest class ever, and he takes it really seriously. you have to think like him to get As on the assignments, there are 5 assignments, one due every week, but if you don't try to hard, you should still get a good grade</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2006<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Technical writing should only be taught by him at DePaul, he seems really hard at first but gives you alot of chances to bring up your grade and he is very resonable with his grading.  Don't get sacred if you do bad on his quizzes, I pretty much failed all of them and still ended up with a B+, and could've got an A but I got lazy @ end of quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take him if your intellect is greater than that of a doorknob, you get marked down for knowing too much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class, easy assignments, and you will learn some useful information.  I highly recomend him, should be an easy A as long as you follow his guidelines.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for business writing. Easy grader, not a lot of work. Great guy overall, and great teacher. You'll learn from him. Take him if you can. 4 memos/letters to write, and an in-class final. Lets you rewrite one of the papers. TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2005<br>Class Name: ENG301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The easiest class I've had at DePaul. You basically have to write 4 papers and you are given at least 2 full weeks for each of them. Just follow the instructions and you'll do fine. If you for some reason didn't do as well as you wanted on one of the papers, you can resubmit it. Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2004<br>Class Name: ENGLISH943<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is awesome.
