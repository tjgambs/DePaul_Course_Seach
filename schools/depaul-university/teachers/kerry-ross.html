I might take her again, but be prepared to read read read. Classes are boring and I never looked forward to them. Lectures equally boring. Midterm is an hour of writing, same with final. Did not enjoy the class debate at end. Not interesting. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this as a focal point requirement, class on Samurai, hoping for it to be interesting and easy. Wrong on both counts, Ross is definitely very interested in the subject, but a horrible teacher. Assigns tons of reading, but barely explains anything.  Shows extremely old and boring movies. And then grades the papers very hard. Would not take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2009<br>Class Name: HST231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the best class I've taken at DePaul thus far. It was easy, but you really do have to work hard on your grade. She is REALLY straightforward with what she wants, how she wants it done, etc. Read the book and you should be fine. She also told us what was going to be on every test, so there aren't any surprises. Easy 'A' if you work for it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2009<br>Class Name: HST231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Get ready for ALOT of reading...that you need to do!! Awesome teacher; explains the things from the readings very clearly. 4 Blackboard Discussions, 1 Map Quiz, 2 Take Home Exams, 1 Midterm, and 1 Final. Be ready to work for your grade; Take this if your really really really love Japanese People. HA</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2009<br>Class Name: HIST230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is amazing, so understanding, easy to listen too, we got to watch like a fun movie, she had lots of slides music, video clips... awesome. She has small quizzes that take about 30 min, bout 5 in all, one big paper as a final and about 5 blackboard postings - easy and Psycho interesting. Never thought I'd appreciate Japanese history so muc</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2009<br>Class Name: HSST161<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ross is a great professor!!
