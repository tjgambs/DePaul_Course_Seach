His class dealing with philosopher's notions on time was incredibly interesting, although difficult. He is more than willing to help and never makes you feel dumb for not understanding. I had little interest in the subject before this class and i genuinely felt as if i gained something. I would recommend this teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy!  He's extremely intelligent, which sometimes makes what he's lecturing about hard to understand but he always makes himself available to help you understand the topic.  Light reading, volunteer to go in the first couple weeks for the group project because there is less information to cover.  Overall, pretty easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pardikes is really nice, extremely knowledgeable, and has some great suits. He doesn't make you buy a book. No reading is longer than 10 pages and he really simplifies the material to your advantage. You must participate either in class or on the discussion board. Overall a great class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No textbook, material is available on D2L. 2 reading assignments every week. 1st half of quarter only thing we do is read & go to class for lecture. Group presentation either before midterm or after. Midterm was 20 short answer questions, only graded 16 w/ one extra credit. Watched 2 movies, and had a final project to be turned in via D2L.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a great class. Jeff is a great teacher, he is extremely knowledgeable and willing to help students. If you have trouble in his class visit him in office hours, he is happy to clarify any confusion. He is a little slow at answering emails, however, which is a bit annoying. He is also pretty easy on the eyes, and dresses quite dapp</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I hated the class, I did not understand anything. He explained our readings perfectly and even saw me after class for a meeting which he explained everything. He offers extra credit, but grades papers kinda hard. I still liked him and he really inspired me to think in a philosophical way now. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not easy but c'mon we are no longer in high school. 2 notes, 3 papers, 12am  e-deadline, 1 rewrite, 2 (tough) extra credits.

Friendly, nice, personable. He's goofy, nerdy but prob gets some ladies. Decent class, but he's cryptic, speaks very academically sometimes or like Plato/Aristotle might. Required to read a lot, Notes portfolio due twice. 3 papers 3-4 pgs 1 book-$11</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2011<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take Business Ethics with this prof!

His approach takes some getting used to, especially as a philosophy teacher. Meaning, he isn't like others and will never talk down to you. He is very smart and vast in what he teaches. Wonderful to talk to, so approachable and understanding, and very open to listening. Genuinely well versed in his study and very good person</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE. Assigned a ton of reading that didn't correlate to the assignments.  Canceled class an hour before it started.  Tends to ramble. Had to edit the schedule four times.

Also, he never posted assignment prompts when he said that he will, he never responded to e-mails, he cancelled class twice, he was very unclear in what he wanted from the students, and he lost half the class' midterms! I still did well, but way too much work and requirements for an intro to PHL course...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this class because usually the material was hard to comprehend but interesting.

He knows what he's talking about, and in class he'll answer any questions. However, HE HASN'T RESPONDED TO A SINGLE EMAIL OF MINE! and he has extremely limited office hours. He grades VERY hard.

A lot of kids take the class just because it's a req which makes it harder for Pardikes to explain everything in detail. Papers are strongly emphasized.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
