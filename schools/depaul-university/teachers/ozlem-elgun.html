You will definitely use everything you learn in her class and apply it elsewhere. The class is not too hard, but you have to pay attention in order to successfully finish all the class activities and homework assignments. She is very helpful and willing to meet with students outside the classroom. Take her!!! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2015<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For Quantitative Reasoning, she was fantastic in making the material applicable to real-world scenarios. She is quirky which makes the long lectures more enjoyable. She assigns a lot of group work and not too much homework (about 1.5 hours per week). Make sure you show up to class and pay attention because the material can be deceiving. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: PSC105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She's goofy, but in an endearing way, and is so passionate about the subject. I genuinely enjoyed listening to her teach, especially since she didn't feel the need to get condescending and pedantic. Instead she'd just explain concepts in layman's terms and make sure you understood.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is okay. The class is easy, just make sure you go. She makes really bad jokes. Overall, easy class and decent teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely love her!You know when you ask yourself "When am I ever going to use this?", well she'll show you when and how to apply certain mathematical concepts to real life. She is passionate about what she does and really helpful. She makes class fun, and I've never enjoyed a math class before. Overall, awesome class nad awesome teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class in general. As long as you do the work, you'll get along with her. She's huge on group work. I didn't have a problem with it but if you like to work alone, I don't recommend her then. She teaches the lesson well and tries to crack jokes sometimes to make the class more fun. She's not strict, and puts an effort into not being boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ugh. Don't take this class if you don't like working in groups. You're paired up with someone the first day of class and you are stuck with them the entire quarter. Then you get a new group for the final. I hatedddd it! She's an ok prof. Go to class, don't rely on the powerpoints she posts online.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very helpful and loves when you participate in class. Very energetic and passionate about the topic. Big on group work which is what I hated most. Not an overall easy class but I learned a lot and would recommend her, she is not that bad at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2011<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so nice and very helpful. She goes through steps to make things very easy. A lot of course work but not a hard grader. You definitely have to attend class to keep up with all the work. but overall she's a good teacher in my book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2011<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A really fun teacher! She's spunky and cheerful, and takes the time to re-explain things if you don't understand them the first time. A lot of material, and a bit of work, but nothing too terrible. I'm not good at math and was able to do well in her class. I would definitely take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2011<br>Class Name: PSC342<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No textbook required just article readings.Her Power Point presentations are loaded with too many words but she's willing to make extra time to help you if you're unclear. Class can be a bit boring if you are not interested in the subject if you are interested, than you'll get a lot out of the class.Overall not bad.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2010<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Elgun's class was difficult. World trade is a very dry subject and she does little to interest students. Her powerpoints are so text heavy that they become obsolete. Her midterm consisted of short, medium, and long answer questions. She loses patience when asked questions and every class dragged on. I wouldn't take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Went through the excel steps at her own pace and had false high expectations of the class. Grades too hard and needs to give less in-class activities that we never had time for in class. Needs to allow more class time for all the work she gives.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
