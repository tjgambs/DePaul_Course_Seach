	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

Rude to students when asked questions - he rolls his eyes. Only 4 tests the whole quarter - ridiculous. The final counts for 40% of your grade.

There is almost homework everyday, but the homework is never collected. There are four quizzes worth 60% of the grade, which are easier than the homework. The final is worth 40% and is very similar to the quizzes. Best math teacher I've had so far.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty decent teacher. doesn't waste your time in class, he just asks if there are questions from the hw - which he doesn't grade. then does examples of the evens from the problem set for that days work. very boring class, but lets you out ussually half-way throught class. 4 quizes worth 40% and 1 final worth 60%.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT TEACHER!!

For my class he assigned the odd problems for HW and did the even in class so the homework was easy to understand. Homework is assigned but not collected or graded.
