	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

I had a rough time with this class, and though I've always enjoyed writing and working with my writing she made it unclear as to why I was not doing well on assignments.

She's excellent if you're too brainless to have your own opinion, otherwise she's a horrible instructor. All I learned to do was summarize her exact words by the end of the quarter for a good grade.

Not just at Depaul, but in my whole educational history! She choses favorites, is not clear with what she wants, and will fail you if you disagree with her-even if you have a good argument! I would not recommend her for anyone, in fact it'd be for the best of all of us if she got fired.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What words to use&#63;   Wise-ass Horribly into herself Ostentatiously academic Reprimanding Extremely Condescending  Basically, this teacher picks her favorites, and if you aren't one of them, too bad for you.  She argues for the sake of inflating her ego, not for trying to make a point.
