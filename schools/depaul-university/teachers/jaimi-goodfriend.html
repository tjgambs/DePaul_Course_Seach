Only posted grades for three out of the eight items, so you don't really know where you stand until the final grade is given. Unpredictable with her grading style, too.  Can sometimes make smart comments and put students on the spot. Would not take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2014<br>Class Name: FIN528<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>interesting lady but class is tough, two cases and a paper in the final week!! Take her 798 ONLY.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice and friendly professor. But we are at school to learn. I learned nothing from her class! the course description is completely different than what is covered in class. I had very high expectations and got completely disappointed. She has knowledge and experience in the field but failed to transfer it to students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jaimi did an excellent job covering all the different areas to manage assets in a hedge fund format.  I very much enjoyed the case studies and discussions.  Disregard the previous rating because it's impossible to go in great depths in a classrooom setting for 10 weeks.  She touches all the topics and inspires you to take it further on your own.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2010<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you need someone to hold your hand through the world of hedge funds, this is a great teacher for that.  This is why DePaul business school has some serious issues.  If you are paying for your classes, more bang for your buck is available in other classes - I felt ripped off.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hedge Funds. Jaimi is perfect for this class; she brings her fund-ownership experience to the classroom. Work is based almost entirely on real-world examples, methods and theoretical. Classes consisted of PowerPoint slides, discussion, and some cases. Weekly group assignments based on cases and two short presentations. Final is an individual paper.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
