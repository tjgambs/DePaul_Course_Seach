Liam strives for the success of his students and has so many humorous/enlightening stories to share along the way. Wether or not you're a env sci/studies student.. if you have a SSMW credit to fulfill, like to read, and are somewhat interested in the ideologies of wilderness and space, try this course!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2013<br>Class Name: ENV217<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class. You have to read 4 books and they are all TERRRRIBLY boring. Not many assignments though so if you don't mind writing a few papers, that's basically all you have to do. That and a very short presentation about an article you read. Easy enough, right?</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: ENV340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love him!!!

Not really any homework except for some readings and online discussion questions, and few easy papers.  Easy grade & workload.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2010<br>Class Name: ENVSCI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Liam is a great prof!

There is a lot of material, but generally it's easy to grasp. Prof. Heneghan is a very understanding, helpful and funny guy. You can learn a lot from him. He uses a lot of powerpoint presentations, which, I think, is awesome... Midterm and Final were not hard and here is a research paper as well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2008<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was great. it was fun and interesting. the work was easy but very useful. professor heneghan is a great guy. hes passionate and such a goof. i highly recommend him even if you have no interest in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2007<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures were great and kept my interest. Good prof... except for his extreme lateness in returning grades! On the day of the final I STILL did not know what my midterm grade was.

Although I didn't have much interest in the subject before the class started..he got me on board for the most part.

Take Him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2006<br>Class Name: ENV<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this man.  I totally agree that he is sort of sexy in a bizarre mad scientist kind of way.  If you're into the environment or nature at all take him! He is so passionate about the topic, it's really inspiring.

I'm pretty sure he gives everyone a B no matter what</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: ENVSCI<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so i pretty much didnt have any idea what the midterm would be on, since we talked about the same thing in different formats everyday. yet come midterm... there were 46 review topics (as in paragraphs and short answer) to be on the final.  funny, the powerpoints didnt reflect this.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him for explore and worked my ass off and got a B+ in the end. His grading is a little inconsistent because I know someone who got the same grade as me and didnt do half the work I did. I kinda made me mad.
