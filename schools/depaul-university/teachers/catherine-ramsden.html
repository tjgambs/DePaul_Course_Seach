Maybe we had a good class, but I didnt think she was that ****y.  Everyone has a different opinion I guess! Dont worry about it if you do have her. 5 weeks does go really fast!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can definitely see why so many people hate her. However, she's not too bad if you don't let her attitude get to you. Remember it's only five weeks.
