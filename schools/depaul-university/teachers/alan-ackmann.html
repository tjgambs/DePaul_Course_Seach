			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

For 103 at least, I have been fairly successful so far. Do the readings, and work consistently on your papers. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Very confusing -Whenever explaining writing assignments he is very confusing in what he is looking for.  beg for help - He is very late responding to e-mails. If you have questions you better be prepared to receive a reply two to three days later.  If you're a very good writer who can write about communication of subcultures easily then take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ackmann is very confusing. He needs to speak in layman's terms. This class focuses on rhetoric and most papers are analyzing different rhetorical strategies. He's very foggy on what he's looking for and rarely gives example primary sources of past assignments or even examples he would write for class. Horrible don't take him.   </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2015<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an English professor, so he is pretty detailed in essay comments (sometimes even a bit too detailed). He's a very nice guy and allows students the chance to speak.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2015<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Professor Ackmann online. The workload is reasonable and fair. His lectures can get a bit dry, but the information is useful. His feedback is very clear and direct. He offers extra credit and was very good about responding to emails.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2014<br>Class Name: 202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice professor and wants everybody to understand the materials. Always answer students questions throughly. But grade too strict on the paper. The final was all written and hard. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decent teacher, horrible grader. Grades a freshman class like a graduate level course. Impossible to get an A, and his grading scale even makes it more difficult. Class is filled with busy work and useless assignments, and the final exam was filled with a bunch of stuff that talked about in passing in class. If you care about your grade avoid him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice professor and is willing to help. But there are assignments due almost every class, most of which are busy work. They are not hard, but are time consuming. I took this class in the last quarter of junior year, so the amount of work distracted me from other harder classes. Take this class as a freshman!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2014<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ackmann is very nice and is helpful. The material for this class is verrrrrrrry boring and professor Ackmann talks very softly sometimes... So I nearly fall asleep during the lectures. But the class is easy and straight forward. Ackmann makes it clear what you need to do to pass.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely hard grader and expects students to be proficient writers at freshman level.  Graded as though this was an upper level class.  Definitely do not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the laptop mandatory class, and it was really interactive which was a nice change of pace. The assignments made you think but he gave you all of the tools necessary to organize and write a good paper. I recommend taking him if you are able to keep up with assignments and if you are attentive in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ackmann is a tough grader but he is very helpful outside of class. He helped me several times and he probably saved me a letter grade or two just based off of how he directed my writing. He is funny and I highly recommend</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Ackman is very funny, nice, and personable. His lectures were fun and the homework was slightly longer than most courses, but straightforward. It's fun to watch as he acts out scenes from TV shows to make his points. Although he grades pretty hard, his lessons have helped me to drastically improve in my writing. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay I have to be honest that he is tough. But what he taught me was totally worth my tuition. If you are trying to improve your writing, take him. If you are just one of those people who wanna get As without working hard, then don't.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Professor Ackmann! He is such an adorable guy who works really hard at what he does. His classes are easy, but he still expects his students to put up an honest effort. He was one of my first professors at DePaul, and I thought he did such a great job! Very smart guy, too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He means well, but avoid this professor if you can. Class time is too structured and wasted. He co-wrote the textbook (which explains enough) and gave reading quizzes that you might not pass even if you read. He also talks down to the class as if we're in elementary school and have never heard of writing. Papers are also graded harshly. Avoid him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice guy and he is very smart on his subject. He is very lenient and if you can make up a good excuse he will believe it. However he fails at trying to be funny and he is kind of boring at times. I have a neutral attitude towards him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2011<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Since the 3rd grade i have been praised for my writing skills, and hardly ever got anything lower than a B+.  This guy gave me a C-.  He teaches a 2 credit 5 week undergrad course and treats it like its the most important class in the curriculum. Gave me a C on a resume that has gotten me 2 professional level jobs, in this economy! DO NOT TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The type of professor who has everything planned out down to the minute. That kind of structure made me not like the class. Also his comments on papers were not helpful at all. Sometimes they were just hurtful. I will not take this professor again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Why would someone still recommend him even though he is not even easy&#63; His class was so useless yet he graded so hard on our papers. By the time you see this, you're probably stuck with him because that is how DePaul plays with their students. Just wait-list yourself somewhere else. Note: I am not mad when I wrote this, thus, am I creditable&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2010<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really tough grader. i considered myself a good writer before this class, getting A's in English my whole life. it was impossible to get an A on anything in his class. really nit picky. GPA killer.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a straight A student, I found it impossible to get an A on most assignments! He has extremely high expectations because of his background and takes off points for minor things. So if you want an A I recommend you meet with him at least twice to discuss your progress. He's a nice guy outside of class. Oh, and be sure to participate in every class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very knowledgeable in the topic. I came into the class not being all that good of a writer, but all his exercises helped tremendously! I would highly recommend him if you need practice in writing. He doesn?t really take any days off but Its College were not babies like someone said so go to class! I would recommend him to EVERYONE!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2009<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Treated us like babies. For every single group activity we did he took class time out to hand select each individual group and make a big deal out of making sure you never worked with the same people. Went out of his way to tell you us take out a sheet of paper and a pen to take notes. This is college not first grade. Tedious and boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2009<br>Class Name: WED204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The bad things are that he is heavy on attendance, never gives days off class or lets you out early, and also he is a tough grader that requires a lot of work.  The good thing about him however is that he has a decent sense of humor, and wants to see his students do well if you go to class and do the minimal work he will pass you</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was terrible. All he did was hand out pointless worksheets that he made students read outloud and constantly repeated himself. I felt like i was in elementary school again. He always made sure to take the full hour and a half with material that could be covered in 30 mins.  Very annoying.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>excellent professor! very helpful and even entertaining. he made his expectations and explanations very clear.  i also found him to be adorable :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a nice guy, had energy, was always willing to help, and he was crystal clear. I liked him. I will somewhat agree on the grading aspect. He did grade a little harder but it was not bad. He gives reading quizes but if you glance over the reading b4 class you will get it. I'm not an english fan at all but his class was one i looked forward to.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2008<br>Class Name: ENGENG<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice enough guy,and he teaches the material well... but I agree with previous statements, in that he grades tough.  He expects perfection, as it's been hard to get any As on his assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Ackmann is an excellent English Prof. The class isn't hard and he is very flexible around the schedule of others.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! very fun and helpful at the same time</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2008<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think what people are overlooking here is that he is teaching required, basic english writing/rhetoric courses.  This is not fun stuff!  It's essential, and he does a good job of preparing students for what is to come.  The class may be dry, but he's very helpful and nice, and I did not find him to be an exceptionally difficult grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof. Highly Recommend.

Although some of his assignments can be tedious, I found them to be very helpful.  He makes it a strong point to go over grammar usage because after peer reviewing other students' papers it's obvious that grammar can sometimes be a very prevalent issue.  Overall, he is a very intelligent teac</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I disagree with all these reviews that Ackmann is a ridiculously hard grader. I think with this class you get what you put in. If you work really hard and actually listen to the things he teaches and apply them, you will do great. If you try to bs your way through the class though don't be surprised if you don't do well. I enjoyed his class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not a fair grader, teaches like a robot</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher!

HE IS AN IMPOSSIBLE GRADER AND HIS CLASS IS SO SO SO BORING. HE PUTS STUDENTS THROUGH HELL WITH ALL THAT STUPID UNNECESSARY WORK.

He expects you to write like a Ph.D. He doesn't provide useful feedback. If you have been getting A's in English and want to maintain that, find a diff. professor. I recommend James Beasley. He makes you read handouts out loud as if we were high school students. Very boring. Does not give A's. You will be lucky if you can get a B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was not very understanding.
