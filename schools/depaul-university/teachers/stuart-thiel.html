			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

He curves like everyone has an F and it is almost impossible to fail.  Review sheets for all exams, attendece is optional.  Go first day, last day, and exam days and you are all good.  Just  browse through the book once.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good teacher.

He is a terrible, boring, teacher. He goes off on random tangents about his ex, or he will explain minor details for 20 minutes which are completely irrelevant in his stupid immature examples. He is probably the worst teacher at Depaul. Do not take him, hang yourself instead so your roomates will get A's.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Hard to follow. Doesn't respond to e-mails, and doesnt address your concerns as a student. the final is based off all of the quizes, but they come from left field, and its hard to get A's on the quizzes. I only took him because he was the only ECON class at LPC, but it was a MISTAKE! Go to the loop, worst professor I have encountered.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His quizzes are hard...but...the final (no midterm) is a breeze.  I got a 100% on it since it was all old quiz questions.  Also, the quizzes may be hard, but they are curved.  So getting an A requires some studying, but its not impossible.

If he ever reads this, I would suggest he have his students purchase a text book to follow him along on the ride.  I had the sensation the quiz'es came out of nowhere, until I bought a $5 Micro-econ book from half.com; then I started being 6 points or so over the median.  I think he knows a lot though.

I would reccomend him, he is not difficult at all, he is very smart and knows his stuff. The midterm and final were both open book take-homes. I am coming from the standpoint of an economics major though, so 105/106 classes probably beware, he might be too hard for first-timers - take Bucci, Ownes, or Berdell.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2005<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst teacher ever!

It's hard to follow him sometimes. He definitely knows his stuff it's just that he talks too much and gives some of the crappiest examples there could possible be.

Basically you do NOT need to buy the book since the quizzes hardly relate to them at all.  He mumbles, switches topics at the snap of a finger, very hard to understand!

Asks the strangest questions on his quizes. I understand this subject very well and I don't understand his questions. Will contradict what he says to do in class on the quizes and expects us to know it. The grading though is very lenient. He curves A LOT, but he needs to</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expect to study your butt off and still fail all the quizzes.  It is normal.  He gives everyone atleast C- He wears the same things every class, has crazy stories, and mummbles, so sit up close to hear.  I would stay away from him and try to take another professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's really nice BUT....horrible teacher.

Yes, he mumbles. I can only surmise that those who gave this guy a bad rating are slackers.  He's one of the more knowledgable profs that depaul shouldbe proud to employ.  Take him if you have the opportunity.  You actually learn something (for a change)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: MICROECON<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Class.  Just show up and listen.  He tries to be very helpful if you don't get it.  Quizzes are once a week and can be difficult, but everything is curved.  Final is based on Quizzes.  No Midterm.  Take this class.  He's a good guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2004<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good guy. Yes, he mumbles. Who cares! If you are struggling at all he is more then willing to help and is very understanding. 75% quizes, 25% final...ridiculous curves. All you have to do is try and you will get a C. Put in some work and you are guarenteed an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you study for the quizzes, you'll do just fine even if you don't do so well on the exams.

His teaching styles vary from week to week dependeing on how many people FAILED the quiz.He tries to be helpful but it makes things worse. He looks like he just rolled out of bed & his methods reflect that.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2004<br>Class Name: MICROECON<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>to break it down....he scribbles on the board, mumbles a lot, and gives you weekly quizzes...and his curve is a bit odd because a person who got 35% and another who got 68%, both got a final grade of c...but there are still worse class at this school</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/12/2004<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a terrible teacher.  His quizzes made no sense at all.  I am really good in Econ. and I did not do very well because of his questions.

Students with a 44% average in the class received a C-. He doesn't fail you unless u just aren't trying. Check out his website at www.stuarteugenethiel.com and click on final combined curve.

He's boring & not the best teacher, but the class is pretty easy.  He has weekly quizes that are all multiple choice and kinda tough, but overall the material isn't hard.
