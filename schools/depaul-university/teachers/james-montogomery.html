Luckily, they don't take long to complete (usually), and he seems to be an easy grader. Discover Week was awesome with Monty as our professor and he's genuinely just a super nice guy. So glad he's head of the environmental science department! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2014<br>Class Name: ENV310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Monty rules. Fun teacher, committed to the students. His courses usually cover some in depth stuff so they are not easy, but you get a good education from him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2013<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Monty is just a good guy, always willing to help. He is the perfect teacher to help with the difficult transition from high school to college, especially if you are new to Chicago. He has such a wide knowledge of Chicago history, it's amazing! The class is interesting and immersion week is fun. You read a great book, Devil in the White City.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Monty for Discover Chicago City on a Lake. He is a great teacher who really enjoys what he teaches. He has a great sense of humor, and seems genuinely concerned with helping the freshmen in his Discover class adjust to college. His class was not easy, but I learned a ton about Chicago! I highly recommend this professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him for Discover: City on a Lake. This is by far the hardest discover class of all the Honors discover's. The work given is way too much than it should. Very few will get A's as he feels teachers and professors grade too easily these days. I was interested in what he had to say, but the difficulty of the ENTRY LEVEL class made it unbearable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2011<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an incredibly nice person, as well as incredibly helpful.  Does a good job of making the material easy to understand, esp. for those like me who are non-majors.  His lecturing can get very dull, however, but if you just need to fulfill the science requirement, it's an easy A or B without much work. And I did learn a decent bit too ;)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2010<br>Class Name: HIN100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is by no means easy. He is a very educated man, he knows a lot but he does not know how to explain himself well, and repeats himself. But like I said he is very smart and knows a lot about everything</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2009<br>Class Name: HON222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you need to take the HON lab requirement take it Environmental Science with Montgomery! The class was a lot of fun, the weekly quizzes are easy if you do the reading. Lab component was actually fun, better than the other sciences. Responds to emails quickly and is very helpful out of class. He gives in-depth study guides too.Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2009<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice guy. there to help if you are confused.class was A LOT of work..a ridiculous amount for a 200 level class, and although I enjoyed the subject, I still felt overwhelmed at times. Essay/short answer tests and quizzes made things even harder. I did well in the class, but if you are going to take him know that you have to buckle down and work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: ENV101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the lectures are painful. do the readings!!! i mean it. he let the class take the midterm over because no one did good. sad story...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2007<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nicest prof. you'll ever meet. Lectures could be a bit dull, but overall I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot. Very helpful. If you do the study guide, you will do fine on the tests. Only downside was a huge group project that ended up being a huge pain although the subject was interesting. Highly recommended though!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2007<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His tests are the hardest I have ever taken! He's very vague on what he expects. Midterm and Final were ALL written!!! The workload for the class is ridiculous for a gen-ed. Find another class to take, this one is not worth the effort.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2007<br>Class Name: ENV242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, funny and wierd but knows his stuff. The class is demanding and tests are NOT easy....but I highly recommend this teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2006<br>Class Name: ENV224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take his classes.  He is hard but possibly one of the most amazing professors i've ever had.  I'm awful at ALL sciences and he was there to help me whenever it was needed.  He grades bsed on how hard you work in the class not neccisarily if you are the most knowledgable in the science field.  If your willing to work you won't be disappointed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2006<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class, but professor is demanding.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2006<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cares a lot about students and course material.

It just seemed like sometimes, he got lost in the sound of his own voice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the most passionate professors I've encountered, but very difficult (tons of material). He should not be teaching intro level classes, for non-majors. Tests are very difficult and long, lectures are very in-depth. But he is understanding, and will help you in any way he can.  Do not take him is you're not willing to try!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2005<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely easy class. listen to lectures, take down notes and you'll do fine!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2005<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Instead of making this entry-level class entry-level, he makes you work like you are doing PhD research. DO NOT take him if you are a nonmajor. Gives out more reading then you can expect to read for 4 classes put together, and is inconsiderate to commuting students. His classes are NOT worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You have to work hard for an A but the class was very interesting.  Monty is a dedicated teacher who knows his subject matter very well.  Gave a review session for final, took 2 fieldtrips.  Highly reccommend</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2004<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>uncle monty was a pleasure as a professor. It is  a tough class for non-majors! the exams covered a lot of hard material!! but the professor is a real gem!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good class if you're a non-major. Lectures are incredibly boring. Homework was easy but the final is ridiculously hard. The Review sheet was 300 questions+ and only put about 25 on the exam. He's a good guy, does care about the students, and is very accessible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2004<br>Class Name: ENV<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Uncle Monty as some of us like to call him is great. He really cares if you do good or bad in his class. He will always take his time to help you out if you have a problem.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2004<br>Class Name: ENV115<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A nice guy, though very oppinionated. He tries sooo hard to make the class relevent, and is offended if you don't have interest. While you might think geology is a blow off, watch out. We really do spend three hours in lab examining rocks.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2004<br>Class Name: ENV<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not the best, when you are taking a non-major class.  He takes his subject matter a little too seriously, and will be upset if you don't care as much as he does about the envronment, watch out he gives hard tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2003<br>Class Name: ENV224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, has a genuine care for student's success, definitely take him for a class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2003<br>Class Name: SCI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher.  Lots of enthusiasm and very easy to get along with.
