People who say they didn't like him just didn't care enough about the class to try to understand his teaching style.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2009<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hilarious, goofy bowtie-wearing dude. Talked about how much he hates living in Gary Indiana, pretty random and funny. Overall, good class and very easy. Randomly loves to show movie clips that have little to do with material which is cool in my book (office space included). Take this guy, you'll get a good grade and a few kicks</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2007<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He did a thorough job.

Did not learn a darn thing. He read the textbook to us, showed movies in class for no apparent reason, and assigned lots of 5th grade busy work.   DePaul should be embarrassed for hiring this guy for the MBA program.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2006<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy.

Hardest class I have taken at Depaul with a huge workload.  If you want to get an A in your HR class take it with a different professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2006<br>Class Name: GSB555ANDGSB<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took two classes from this guy.  I really liked his style. He's very funny and he cares about his students.  I'm sure glad DePaul hired &quot;Dr. D. - the students' friend.&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2006<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's great and funny. i picked up a lot in the class. i am taking class with him again gbs 599, cause i learned a lot in mgt 555 and got good grades too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2006<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wasn't a hard class, but a waste of money. You will really come out of the class thinking you wasted a lot of time on nothing. Not sure who hired this guy....but they didn't think it through, he's strange.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2006<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he was very thorough and not particularly demanding.  Quirky, though.  Was always willing to give assistance to students.  He does randomly ask questions of all the students so you have to be on your toes during the lectures.  I really liked him.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
