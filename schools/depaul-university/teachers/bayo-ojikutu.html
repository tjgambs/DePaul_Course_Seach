Both great classes. Great guy. Class is always very interesting. I skipped his class once and I actually felt bad for doing so haha. Opens your eyes to a whole lotta things. His LSP classes are pretty easy, you do have to participate though!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2012<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Ojikutu, seriously adore him. He really opens your eyes to a lot about the Black Migration to Chicago. He is a novelist himself and very passionate about the subject. He expects a lot on papers but its totally worth the work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him for my focal point -Chicago's Black Migration Narrative. He is really interesting and knowledgable on his subject. If you do the readings and participate in class you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2010<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite teacher at DePaul by far. He gets you to think about things in a way you never would have thought of. You discuss things like the definition of race. Get to know him because if you do hell care about you as a person not just a student. He is hard, because he is smart but its not hard to get a good grade if you put a little effort.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2010<br>Class Name: ENG101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bayo is a great teacher, he really cares about what he teaches and knows his stuff...hes an author and also teaches at the university of chicago, descent amount of reading but as long as you read most of it and speak up in class he will take a liking to you, very good teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2009<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is very interesting. He is very intelligent and witty. He leaves any sort of political correctness behind and gets to the true root of why things happen. He is always there to help personally and professionally and takes deep interest in his students. I would take another class from him anytime.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2009<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was decent. Four books for this class which you hardly use..I'd recommend borrowing them for the library which will save you about $100. He tends to mumble and his handwriting is horrible.  He's kinda boring and uses too many big words..like he can't say what he wants simply and wants to show off his vocabulary.  Overall I'd give the class a C</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2009<br>Class Name: ENG291<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Those who rate him poorly have ridiculously high standards for people. He's great! He's smart, funny, helpful, knowledgeable. Granted, he mumbles a lot but it's a kind of enlightened Einsteinian sort of scattered-brained mumble. And, yeah, he isn't particularly organized, but, in exchange, there's lenience on his part. I'd recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: ENG307<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was not completely organized, so it was a little frustrating never really knowing details about assignments. The actual class was a good class to take. Very useful workshops. The most helpful part of this class were the peer workshops.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2008<br>Class Name: WRD203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His writing is attrocious and he often requires you to write down random thoughts he has, but no one can even come close to how much he knows about the subject. He is quite funny, and very approachable. Only lectures, and they are quite boring, but very informative.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2008<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He may have an impressive vocablary, but everything he says is repetitive, and his lectures are unhelpful. We only has class once a week,  but he often did not show up, and he seemed to see no problem with this. He assigned papers only 2 days before the day they were due, one of which was the Sunday after Halloween. I am not a fan.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2008<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome class, amazing teacher. I would recommend Film and Lit to everyone. He does use big words but he is smart and nice. One of the dopest teachers at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Did not really understand what he was talking about.  He mumbles threw things and goes off on tangents.  Does not help students when they need it.  Really difficult to deal with.  I understand that hes a published writer but I don't think he has any business teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2008<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is incredibly intelligent, passionate & inspiring. He will make you think & question the way you view yourself and the world around you. Plus, he is a novelist. His assignments were not the easiest but I greatly enjoyed them & learned a lot... Finished w/ an A, so it was worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very smart, very funny guy. Yes he tends to ramble on on his lectures..but he is very intelligent. very willing to give feedback for papers. READ the books and participate in class and you will do fine. 1 pop quiz, 1 paper, 1 test, 1 final paper. not too demanding. easy load. easy A, would recommend</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2008<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>no one could understand anything he said. its the way he talks and writes. i had to send an assignment to my mother who is a writer and an editor to have her decipher it for me. it took her half an hour to try and figure out what he wanted us to do. he also insulted me in an email when i asked for help. also a tough grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bayo is the illest in the game. Not many understood his sense of humor in the early classes, but once you do you realize the guy is hilarious.  He the smartest teacher ive ever had.  He cares about his students, and always offers help.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2007<br>Class Name: ENG101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best teachers ive had</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2007<br>Class Name: ISP407<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Carlton Banks.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Clearly these raters have no understanding of the privilege of being taught by a two time published and decorated novelist. Come on DePaul, I expect more from you. Stop expecting to be entertained and listen to the man; he's brilliant.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, class discussions are not only about the readings but he also relates them to real world situations. He is very knowledgeable and makes class interesting. He does mumble sometimes but if you listen to what he's saying, he's probably cracking a joke. He's awesome, take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2007<br>Class Name: ENG307<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ojikutu does not organize class time and discussions well. This was a workshop class and people were giving more feedback than the class time permitted and Ojikutu did not stop them. The class went on overtime into spring break. The professor does mumble and his instructions are unclear and not directed at the students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2007<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was so unorganized and was 2 weeks late getting my rough draft back to me.  It should have taken him one night to do it... tthats how it was with everyone else's paper!  Also we learned maybe 3 concepts the first week of classes and after that we did absolutely nothing.  Hands down worst english teacher ever, i dont know why depaul keeps him!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2007<br>Class Name: EN104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most pretentious teacher I have ever met.  I would not recommend taking this class, but if you end up in it it is not that bad.  He lectures to the board and assignments take at least 10 minutes to decipher what he is even talking about</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i love ojikutu he is the best ever, he has very interesting discussions and assignments arent that bad if you do the reading</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awful.  He speaks to the chalkboard and mumbles.  His assignments are unclear.  He cancelled class and graded papers during class time.  He makes waste of class time like its his job. Some of the ideas discussed are interesting, but the man has attitude!  He is argumentative and arrogant.

Realy deep conversations. He let us know that the only thing that matters is the assignments (we only had 4 for the whole semester) it didn't feel like you had to do the readings as long as you where able to give civilized discouse.
