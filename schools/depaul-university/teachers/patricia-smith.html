She is pretty clear and basically tells you what to study for mid-term and final though, that is her best attribute. She has a weird grading scale though where adding up the points don't actually get you your grade either. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2015<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of your grade is based on team work--my only complaint. The syllabus seems intimidating, but Prof. Smith is very nice and the work is absolutely manageable (if your team isn't completely worthless). One of my least hated accounting classes. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2015<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very specific in what she is looking for and very clear as to where you got points off. Her lectures are informative, and the tests have no surprises. Ultimately it't not a hard class but does require work. There's a group assignment every week (not all of them are hard) and one group formal. Put the work in and you should get a good grade. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2014<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>She is very approachable and checks email frequently. Her fill in the blank as we go along style lecture notes are the exams, along with a few short chapters from the novel sized book. Lots of group work in any ACC350 class, and she takes it seriously so check everyone's work b4 submitting. I would definitely recommend.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Smith is very professional, nice, and a decent professor. She had a few slip ups in the class but who doesn't? I think she prepared us for her finals but not to the degree I would have preferred (for example she just told us to study with a little review in class). I got an A but I had to study</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Acc was always hard for me but Prof Smith is a very good teacher. Her material on take home tests is pretty hard and you must study for her exams. Lots of outside time requiredfor studying and homework</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not easy and she doesn't plan on making it. The material you learn in class is completely different from the quizzes and HW. She doesn't curve and tricks you with everything from quizzes to the midterm and final. Avoid her if you can because you will see no results of improving.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard quizzes in the beginning with a tough midterm and takes forever to grade papers. She zooms through certain topics too fast in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has an odd and quite ineffective way of teaching the material. Also, you won't finish all the chapters you're supposed to finish in this course. Take someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has her own unique style of teaching. This causes a lot of consfusion, because her notes are not always very similar to the book and she will often give assignments and quiz questions where the book will not help you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As people have stated before she talks very fast and she will also make quizzes very complicated for no good reason at all. It doesn't matter if you know the material, if you're not familiar with the type f questions she will ask then you will struggle. If you find accounting easy, this professor can make it very difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quizzes are much harder than necessary. You can easily fail them even if you feel like you understand the material in class. Take someone different if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not like most accounting professors. The questions she gives you on quizzes and are incredibly difficult. You'll think the stuff easy in class but that is not the case. I compared the questions to the questions that my friend's professor had and his were much easier.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The quizzes are impossibly difficult. You can have an easy time with the homework and assignments but the quizzes are way harder that you would expect having breezed through everything else.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you thought ACC101 was easy then ACC102 will be a lot easier.  She is a very helpful teacher.  Be sure to go to class and follow her notes. I never used the textbook and did well on her tests just going over her notes and the online hw.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Smith is crystal clear when it comes to her lectures. She teaches you well and prepares you for exams really well. However, show up to class. I got an A on everything...including exams but received a B+&#63;&#63;  I missed class once and left early once.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was not very clear on exactally what to learn in class. she gave real world examples but instead of helping and teaching what we were tested on she wanted us to know everything. not the best professor to take if what to know what to study for to get an A, her h.w and class notes were filled with extra work which you are not tested on!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not that good at accounting and I took this 2 quarters ago, but here is my analysis. It wasn't easy for me. There were quizes about every other week. The midterm and the final was pretty tricky. It doesn't help that she talks a little bit too fast sometimes, but just ask her to repeat what she said. On the bright side she is very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2009<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>her notes were crystal clear. if you didnt read the chapters but studied the notes you wouldve gotten a good grade. and yea the midterm and final was probably hard bc students didnt put enough effort into it. this is an intro class, so there must be a lot of freshman taking it that dont understand that they need to study! TAKE PATTY SMITH!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2009<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Im a senior at DePaul now and i had smith when i was a sophmore and i wish there were more professors like her. to see all these negative comments about her (obviously by the same person) is sad. she is such an excellent teacher i wish more acc teachers like her were at DePaul. she does everything in her power to make the material clear to the clas</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor--she makes it clear that you must attend class and do the homework to be successful.

I thought the midterm and final were ridiculously tricky. I would not take her again for anything else so obviously I do not recommend her. If you can take Pritchard for 101 OR 102...DO IT! She is the best--seriously!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a really good teacher. Accounting is actually fun with her. So take her. She goes over homework problems and explains them well. She has hand outs for all chapter . So book is really not needed.

I loved her! Cares about students, prints out notes so no need to read text, puts everything online so don't need to go to class. You either got it or you didn't. If you do the homework it's an easy A (takes a little time but easy). I never took accounting before and got 99 on midterm, 97 on final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she talks too fast and she expects u to know the material even if ur not an accouting major...DONT TAKE HER!

She does talk extremely fast and sometimes makes you fall asleep because you just can't keep up with her so it's easy to just tune her out. The avg. midterm grade was a 75%, which is ridiculous. The labs are ridiculous too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not a good teacher at all. She talks too fast and Does not offer any extra credit.  She is only giving extra credit because the college of commerce is making her give it to people this quarter.  Tests are hard. class average is like a 75, which sucks so she is not a good teacher. If i were you take someone else if you are not an accounting m</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Smith is just awesome! funny and straight to the point and makes the material crystal clear! ACC 101 is one of the hardest courses at DePaul but with this professor you'll ace with no problem! There's a quiz every now and then and she even offered extra credit if you participate on eRecruiting.

Her class is very well structured and she makes it easy to study by outlining each chapter in typed notes. Quizes were frequent early on, but only one or two after the midterm. Material was kind of rushed post-midterm.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor! Really tries to make you understand the material. Took her for both ACC 101 and 102 and would recommend her to everyone.  Midterm and Final and a project or two.

She explains everything very well that kids can understand her. Always interesting & never boring. Very few hw, little to no reading, & has notes prepared for u already. Also, I recommend going to all the classes just so u don't miss anything. It helps. Best acct prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2007<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smith is definitely not an easy teacher, but she does teach the material well.  Your grade is based off of some take home assignments, eduspace, midterm, and final.  Though it is not required, I would strongly recommend attending class.  The lectures are very helpful.  You have to work hard for an A, but it can be done.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2007<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting professor. Keeps you entertained. Never been a moment where I was bored in the class. It's hard, but if you take good notes and pay attention to his teaching, you will be fine. One thing good about is sometimes he gives hints away. If i had to chance to take managerial accounting again, I would take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2007<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>too much costly printouts. her midterm and final are tricky. if you're not interested in accting at all, i would def recommend TOWER instead.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A...

If I could i'd take her for all my accounting classes. She doesn't give grades away, but as long as you pay attention you'll have no problem passing. Very helpful and not boring.

Which was a relief, yet average midterm grade was a D-. Certainly passing, but not acceptable. Understandably, one gets what one puts into a class. I would not recommend for those who need detail. Large amounts of costly print-outs needed. Far too fast for intro class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: ACC202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worlds fastest talking professor.

Tests can be difficult if you do not study. She definitely does her part well, but you have to work to get an A. Just attend class, do the take-home assignments, and take notes.
