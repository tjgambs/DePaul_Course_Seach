She is always willing to help at any time, if you need help. Although she doesn't have a ton of assignments, she still taught me a lot about writing. However, be prepared to participate, as she usually picks on the quiet kids in the class. Also, you do not need the textbook. I didn't even get it. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an amazing teacher. So nice, So understanding and can really relate to her students. The only material we needed for the class was the New York Times. Other than that just being there and doing the short, easy reflections, and a couple of essays thats pretty much all. Would definately take another class with her!!! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Weiner was really one of my favorite teachers.  Her assignments aren't hard, but I learned a lot from the class.  Most of all, she gives really detailed feedback.  Definitely recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice, always willing to help you with anything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Weiner was incredibly helpful.  She really cares about her students and is available to meet, text or email any time.  I learned a lot in this class about how to write better.  Would completely recommend taking her class for anyone who has to take WRD 103.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Weiner is often unclear with her assignments, and every handout contained multiple typos. The class essentially insulted my intelligence and I didn't take it seriously whatsoever. However, she is a very easy teacher and means well, but if you are a good writer, you will be bored.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2011<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her assignments are always unclear. There no assignment description. All the things she puts on the syllabus are like argument, proposol. And after you sumbit the paper, she will say this is not what she askes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: TL429<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Of all the methods courses I have had to take,Ms. Weiner actually taught me something. She provided concrete lesson ideas, shared relevant classroom experiences of her own, and made all of her materials and class notes available to us via the web. Definitely worth taking!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Weiner is a great teacher.

Although writing is not my thing, she definitely made me work hard and helped me improve a lot.  Definitely worth taking</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a decent teacher, but I had some issues with her. I had a question about a paper (what exactly she wants from you isn't always very clear) and emailed her about it 5 days before the due date, and didn't get any response until the morning the paper was due. Other than that the class wasn't very hard, I got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Weiner is great. All you need is to work hard and show her the rough drafts, she will help a lot!.. Highly recommended, class is really fun. If you have to take WRD 104 take it from her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice woman.  I had some issues with her though.  A lot of her assignments seemed vague and I only really understood what she wanted after talking with her.  Strict attendance policy.  She exudes confidence, which can be really annoying at times.  Kind of pretentious actually.  A lot of busywork during class periods, didn't help much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2008<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Deborah is a great teacher! She takes a lot of time to work with all of her students and she really cares about every single one of us. I would highly recommend taking her for an English class if your given the chance... you won't regret it!!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
