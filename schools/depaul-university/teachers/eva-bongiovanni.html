This is a perfect class to take to get a taste of the PRAD realm, and it was the class that convinced me to change my primary major to PRAD.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: 224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows her Advertising. Years of experience. Hands down best professor I've ever had. Actually wanted to come to this class. Her tests and IA's are all based on what you learn in lecture. Show up, pay attention, and pass the class. Everything she teaches is 100% useful in the working world. Did I say she's the best prof I've ever had??</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Big data class is one of the best classes I've taken in the PR & advertising program. It's a class which makes you really learn something (instead of creating some stupid campaign no one will need). I wish DePaul had more classes like this one.  Professor is very knowledgeable and experienced. She is not a tough grader, so don't worry!  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor at DePaul hands down. Learned more in this class than any at DePaul- Eva isn't easy but she helps you when you need it and teaches you exactly what you need to know to enter the Advertising field. TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. B is very passionate, due to her experience in the industry. The format of the class is effective. She indirectly prepares you for the final/mid-term by constantly reviewing core material. A final project comes mid-way through the quarter. You will have more than enough time to prepare for the final after the project! I have learned so much!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She is great, she pushes you harder than any other professor in Comm. which is exactly what I wanted.  Most Comm classes are no work at all.  This is the hardest one I have taken yet.  She knows everything about advertising and it's great to learn from a real professional.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Eva has worked in the advertising business for years and really knows her stuff. She is straight up and can be critical, but she is a great look at what a future in advertising will be like.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so inspiring I made this account just so I can rave about her & her class! She is absolutely brilliant. I recommend you read her DePaul Bio as well. Very successful career and great teacher! Not overly difficult if you find advertising interesting. Three individual assignments, one group project and midterm/final. Taking her for everything!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really the best Professor At DePaul. She is their to help you and get you ready for your Career. She is straight forward and treats you like an Adult. Its more of a Professional Environment instead of a classroom with her which is what more classes need.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD336<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a difficult course but it's extremely valuable if you're interested in advertising.  Prof. B is really helpful and clearly outlines the course project.  I would strongly suggest taking one of her classes, one of the best teachers I've ever had. Also the course project is a great experience, and she's very helpful with career goals.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was not an "easy" class but not impossible to get an A. Lots of assignments throughout the quarter. She's pretty strict but you'll learn a lot if you're interested in the topics.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I've had at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has every right to be arrogant! She's the best professor I've ever had. Most of prad classes at DePaul are kinda stupid but not hers! You will learn a lot, a lot a lot from her. Prof Bongiovanni is extremely experienced and knowledgable. She can be a hard grader sometimes. Shouldn't be a problem though if you work hard & smart.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Bongiovanni is tough re: deadlines and always says she wants professional style papers and projects.  High expectations for an intro class.  Very inspiring teacher, I want my career to be just like hers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best prof I've had yet</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best "real world" learning experience.  She has high expectations, this is not an easy "A", but if you are going into advertising you will learn more in this class than any other.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2012<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Bongiovanni is great! She is pretty tough, but she wants you to learn something! Class consisted of MC midterm and final, three small individual projects, and a group project. The exams are pretty much straight from the textbook so you MUST read it! She knows what she is talking about and super enthusiastic about marketing! Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2012<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super helpful. Really funny. She wants to challenge you and wants you to learn and you can tell. Would definitely take her again!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
