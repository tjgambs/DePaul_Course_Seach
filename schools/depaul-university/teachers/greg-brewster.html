It was a good use of time (especially if you're busy and don't have time to watch hours of lectures). Everything was explained clearly and the prof was helpful and engaging. I would definitely sign up for one of his classes again, and his voice is so relaxing! Haha.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2013<br>Class Name: TDC560<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows the material being taught in the class.

At first it may have seemed a bit overwhelming but he explains his lectures very well.  Although there are mostly powerpoint lectures, there really is no other way to learn this much information.  Also, the labs are very well instructed and are excellent examples of what we actually learn in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: TDC365801<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best Instructor out in DePaul.
