Not a ton of homework and realizes that you spend so much time on it so he gives you 45% for it.  Tests are just like hw problems.  Always willing to help.  Stats really made sense to me after this class. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2010<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love stats now because of him.  I realized how useful and easy it can be.  Homework worth 45% and he doesn't give more than 15 problems a week.  Always willing to help.  But you have to attend lectures to know what is going on obviously.  Easy to get a good grade if you stay on top of homework.  Midterm and final is taken from homework problems.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like the fact that homework is worth a lot. However I personally thought the powerpoints made the homework confusing. Not as clear as it could of been. But still pretty easy to get a good grade in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2010<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>definitely take him. home is work 45% and tests are easy. if you do the homework you'll get a good grade. makes powerpoints so easy to understand material. he gets confused with himself but knows what he's doing</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
