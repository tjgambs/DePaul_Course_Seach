You HAVE to attend or you just won't be able to do well. 4 tests each 25% of the grade. You have to work, its not an easy A, but if you use his clear study guide and keep up you can do well. He's a great professor. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2014<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT take a Business Ethics with this guy!!! He is totally not clear on what he accepts on the exams. It is very easy to do poorly in this class. I am a philosophy major, senior at DePaul,and this was my worst PHL course at this university. Once again, avoid him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2013<br>Class Name: PHIL229<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You'd have to make a conscious effort and try REALLY hard in order to do poorly in this class. Awesome guy. Funny. Makes philosophy really easy to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2011<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kevin is such a great professor! Kevin gives you all the exam topics and the essay prompt before the exam. Prepare for the exams, and you're golden! Attendance is not mandatory, but if you don't go, you will not understand the material from the textbook. I highly recommend this class for business ethics or an easier phl credit!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: PHL300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I truly miss having this professor.  He was great to listen to, he explains philosophy in such a way that it clicked in my mind.  Prior to his class, I hated philosophy, most likely due to bad teachers.  Prof. Thompson turned me into a lover of philosophy.  All he does is lecture, but its great to listen to and take notes on.  DONT SKIP HIS CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2007<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool guy, low key down to Earth.  He gives you the essay question before the exam so you can actually formulate a response.  Open to all ideas, but they MUST be backed up by the philosophical approaches studied.  Made three hours fly by.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2007<br>Class Name: PHL297<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>must keep up with the material.  two test worth 60 percent of grade and one final paper worth 40 percent.  if you put in the work you can get an a</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Thompson was a fantastic professor. He was very clear and concise in his lectures. He made summarized main themes to the point where even the least philosophically inclined person in the world would comprehend the material. His expectations were reasonable and homework assigned was never overwhelming. A+++</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has the ability to talk for an hour and not say anything.  Though his class is allegedly discussion-based, student comments only serve as a springboard for him to jump into another lengthy, dull, and extremely repetitious lecture. The plus side is that he will cover everything you need to know (in a roundabout way) very thouroughly: easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2007<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good prof. Material was well chosen, very interesting, and actually useful in &quot;real&quot; life. Although I think he lectures far too much, the lectures were quite good. Class stuture lacked any substantial dicussion--which you may or may not like.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2006<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To me the class was not boring at all, and well worth my DePaul $$.  He is an excellent teacher, and I would reccommend people taking his  class for phil. requirement.  You have to work hard in his class, and argue your points well to make a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2006<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he scares you when he says read the text 4 times, but it seems unnecessary.  Especially since he will repeat EVERY point at least 3 times.  Class is soooo boring and he does not shut up, but he gives you the test concepts and questions (which is always good!)  Also, tests are heavily weighted on the essay for bad MC test takers!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/04/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All this guy does is talk, talk & talk. It seems as if he can never shut up. He doesn't let others participate. If you try to say something he will cut u of and keep runnin his mouth. He makes you read thebooks 3 times. He's a mess. He comes to class with an untugged shirt, unshaved and no tie with a jacket. Bottom line is he's a complete ****.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's a good guy and he knows his stuff, but my god this class was boring!  he just talks at you the whole time, it is truly a struggle to stay awake.  he is easy though, i completely stopped reading halfway through the quarter and still got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: BUSINESSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him! This man is gifted. Don't miss class though and write down everything he says. You don't need to read the book even because he explains everything in class. Makes dull material interesting.  Love him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kevin is a great teacher. He really tries to make everyone understand what he says, so he will rephrase everything to make it easy. Gives u the test questions before the test, what else could u ask for&#63;!&#63;! So basically its just memorizing ur answers for the test and u will do fine. study and youll get an easy A!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2005<br>Class Name: PHL296<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart and funny, and probably the best philosophy professor I've had.  he presents the material like a story, so it's very easy to remember everything.  it's all based on his interpretations though.  readings aren't really necessary because he gives you exam questions in advance, and lecture notes cover it all.  just take good notes! easy A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was nice enough but the material was so boring that it was often hard to stay awake.  He tells you what the exams are on which is great, but he grades way too hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decent professor, but an insanely hard grader for not teaching all that well.  Seems to have a great attitude, but he can bore you to tears with his material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2005<br>Class Name: PHL297<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>material was sort of boring but he makes it VERY interesting. he treats everyone equal (non-majors and majors). I received an A but you must study. easy grader</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very interesting lecturer and good guy but a disgustingly bad grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor. He gives 3 tests to determine grade for the quarter, and the class before each test he gives you the questions and outlines the answers for you. He's very clear and reviews very well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has three tests, all of which are derived from his interpretation of the books he assigns.  He gives the test questions the day before the test, so put down what HE talks about in the lectures for answers on the exams.  Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2004<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Thompson is awesome. The classes are all lectures and there are 3 or 4 tests. No midterm, final, or papers. He also gives the test questions the day before the test. I recommend his class.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
