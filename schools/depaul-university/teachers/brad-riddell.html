His assignments are straightforward. If you watch the movies in DC 222 and pay attention to the lecture slides, you'll do fine on all the online quizzes/tests. Do what he assigns and you'll be fine. You don't have to stay and watch the movie when he shows it because he leaves, so just watch the movies on your own time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2015<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class online. Class is worth 500 points,4 exams and 1 paper each worth 100 points. Two 25-point extra credit opportunities. Easiest online class I've ever taken! No discussion boards! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2015<br>Class Name: DC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm into directing and VFX, but after being "trained" by Brad to write well I now feel more than confident with the process. His enthusiasm and feedback were a refreshing comfort to the other stuff shirt profs I had and he saved my first year experience at DePaul. I'm taking another class taught by him. If you want to sharpen your pen, he's the man</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2014<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Riddell was a fantastic professor. I took his class over the 2013-2014 Winter Intercession to knock off a liberal arts class and I must say this was the best class ever. He is very knowledgable about the industry so if you're looking to go into that take him! Also, who doesn't want to watch movies for a class?!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: DC561THESIS1<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing Professor. Super hottie.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Riddell, makes you want to be a screenwriter. He is in the business, so he is very knowledgeable about all that is film. I regret that i took this class as an online class, i wished i could have taken it there. He had so many comments regarding the movies and made this class fun. Be sure to take notes and learn all the beats.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unbelievable class.  It is basically watching movies and interpreting them. Not recommended for an on-line class because you miss so much by not being there.  Prof. Riddell is so charismatic and knowledgeable. Just watch the movies and dissect the materials that he provides.  GREAT class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: HOLLYWOOD<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really outgoing teacher who's really passionate about his job but at times when you try your best on the homework, you don't end up receiving the grade you would think that you deserve. He's a really hard grader and the work load is a lot. If your looking for an easy "A" don't take this class. There is no slacking</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really hard when it comes to grading papers and expectations. He expects everyone to act like they are film majors. Good movies are watched, though. If he didn't grade so hard I would probably enjoy this more.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
