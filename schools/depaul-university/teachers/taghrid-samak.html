She explains things in a way that is easy to follow, but when she answers the same questions over and over to that one students that &quot;just&quot; can't get it the simply but time consuming activities will get on your nerves. Bring a pillow and blanket.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, very helpful. Provides a very straight forward approach to the material. No projects, just short homework and in class assignments. Midterm and Final were easy. No one should have a problem doing well in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated this class but I loved Taghrid. She is so cute and helpful. Knowing that she was always going to be helpful and grade you fairly made suffering through a class completely uninteresting to me tolerable.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
