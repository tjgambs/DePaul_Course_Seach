A good mathematician but a very poor communicator and she didn't seem to care if a student struggled. She simply was not interested.

She favored male students and I would have never known she was discussing my weaknesses in Math, grades and SELF unless a kind student who I wasn't even friends with but had went to h.s. with and heard my name informed me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2006<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Best Profesor at DePaul.

I wish her all the best as she ventures into the world of high school math.  She's such a cutie and extremely helpful and knowledgeable about her subject.  Her assistant was also a cutie and very helpful.  He did a fine job of grading!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2005<br>Class Name: MATH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear and helpful, quiz and test are based on hw and class disscussion problems.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Tolias is someone who is clear and understanding. However, I feel ISP 120 was the biggest waste of time. The class taught me almost nothing, and while the homework was easy, it was extremely time consuming. If you do need to take ISP 120 though, Dr. Tolias is a great professor to have.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prob. the best QR prof. Real nice, first teacher to actually show how math is valuable in real life. Likes to be called by first name, which tells you a lot. Have fun with her, but take her class seriously at the same time, bc she does and expects respect, never skipped a class bc I didnt mind going</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: ISPQUANREAS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice and knowledgeable teacher, can be clearer on certain things but overall she was pretty cool.

She has a TA grade all of the homework in which the TA grades awful. Overall, she is nice and always willing to help you. However, she should grade her own papers and go over her lecture notes for longer than 10 minutes in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: MATH215<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The math reasoning class was mostly learning on your own and then having to come to class just to have her go over the homework. Meanwhile she never teaches you anything. Take it she sucks. I had to drop her class it was so awful. If you take math reasoning take it with Dr. Gato instead.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2005<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tolias is a very nice teacher. She is willing to give you help during office hours, or after class. Makes math relate to YOU. I found her very helpful, if you do the homework you should be relatively okay on the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>probably the best teacher you can take for QR. the homework can be kinda time consuming. all the information in the class was very knew to me...but i ended up getting a B anyway.
