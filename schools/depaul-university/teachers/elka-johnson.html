The material itself was kind of hard but she made it as easy as possible.  No textbook only printout articles, which was nice. Just be sure to go to class and participate and you'll do fairly well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2011<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a very clear teacher and as long as you did the assigned work, you would receive a good grade. She did a good job teaching, especially considering that I was not a fan of the book that we had to use. I took her for two quarters, and overall I would recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was annoying when she talked, mostly her hand gestures. It was really difficult for me to stay awake in class, and I had it at 2 in the afternoon. I couldn't get interested in the class no matter how hard I tried</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2010<br>Class Name: SPN352<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!!!
