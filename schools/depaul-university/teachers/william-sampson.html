He is smart but also super unforgiving. If you are the type of person who might miss class or procrastinate this isn't the teacher for you. Also he changes the syllabus a lot, and does not have a D2L page. You must be a really good note taker and type A personality. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2015<br>Class Name: PPS251<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Sampson is old school, but he is a huge source of information. Although disagreeing with conservative arguments, gave one of the most thorough understandings of it, despite other reviewer, and no, doesn't pick favorites on class or race. Really amazing and enlightening, takes care of his students. Wouldn't take if not public policy major.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor. Preaches reverse racism, refuses to hear opinions outside of his own with utter arrogance, and picks favorites choosing to explicitly seek out African Americans, rich or not, and identify them with struggles they don't have. Utterly coddling them. If you're white, he essentially marginalizes and degrades you and your values.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2012<br>Class Name: PPS302<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE Sampson's classes!

And he's a jerk.  Sure, he focuses on race and education, but hey.  No sense in ignoring the elephant in the living room.   I didn't mind the white-girl verbal beat-down. He never attacked me as a person, just told it like it is.  I appreciated that. Get tough and take the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: PPS201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not helpful at all. Funny at times but makes you feel like****. He makes fun of everyone for not knowing certain things, and not asking questions.When you do ask he rips on you even harder.

He treats you like the adult you should be.  He asks tough questions to push you, not to be a jerk.  I believe he truly wants you to learn.
