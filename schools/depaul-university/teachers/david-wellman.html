He makes sure you know he is always available to talk for help and provides very clear criteria for what he expects of you in papers. He is very focused on D2L discussion posts (annoying) and assigned a lot of reading for each class. Papers/Exams were not terrible. You need to work for your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2015<br>Class Name: CTH 246<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's an easy class but requires a ton of work. Specifically there are readings assigned every class, where you need to come up w/ question(s) based on said readings. He's a funny guy. No tests. Downside: You have to give a 10 minute presentation at some point in the class & ton of readings. Do not take this class if you don't like to read!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2015<br>Class Name: REL190<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I was skeptical going into this class due to the reviews here but he actually wasn't bad! Took the class online, it was the usual stuff of reading, responding, and taking quizzes. 1 midterm paper and 1 final paper. Given there was a lot of stuff to read but it still wasn't awful. Get what you put in, I'd take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2015<br>Class Name: CTH246<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>David is a passionate professor and you will learn a great deal from him.  He is crystal clear in the expectations for each assignment, and as long as you follow them, you will be just fine.  Be sure to complete the assigned readings, as the following class discussions will be based on the material.  One of the best professors at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: REL201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Wellman is a very good teacher. He outlines exactly what is expected of you in your papers or presentation. Very fair grader, and most of the students succeed in  his class. 2 papers and 1 small presentation, along with weekly postings to the d2l discussions area.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2013<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wellman is the best teacher i've had so far at DePaul. I plan on taking another class with him again if all plans out well. He is sooooooo smart, engaging, enthusiastic, classy, and charismatic. You will learn so much from professor Wellman and you will have a good time doing so. He is really hip and youthful, and pretty easy on the eyes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2013<br>Class Name: HON350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wellmann is one of the nicest and most helpful professors at DePaul. There is quite a bit of reading to do before each class, but you don't have to read all of it. D2L discussion posts about the readings are due before each class. 3 papers that he walks you through. Really easy to participate in and no book. Interesting and great class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2013<br>Class Name: CTH235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wellman is one of the most brilliant people I have ever met. He knows exactly what he is talking about every topic that is covered in the syllabus. The subjects we cover can get dry at times, but his personality and attitude keep the class entertaining. If you need to take a religion course, go with Dr. Wellman!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Wellman is seriously one of the smartest men I know.  He is also a great teacher, very understanding and truly cares about his students and having them actually LEARN!  Take him! :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An incredibly intelligent and insightful person. Very open minded and kind. Helpful and willing. Yes, there is quite a bit of reading, but the reading is interesting and always discussed in class. He is very passionate about his job and about learning new things as well as teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2010<br>Class Name: REL298<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared to have your brain twisted into new and exciting thought.  This class proves to be very challenging but all the expectations are clearly outlined in the syllabus and Dr. Wellman does a fantastic job in teaching the class.  It is the corner stone for the Religious studies program and therefore is intense in vocabulary and expectations.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2010<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wellman is awesome. He lets you discover things for yourself and I found that his class had me learning a lot about Christian Ethics in relation to ME rather than just facts. He does grade a little rough, but offers a lot of extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2010<br>Class Name: REL201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very passionate about a very dry and boring subject. I enjoyed his enthusiasm. If you don't want to dress up as a historical figure and give a small presentation in front of class...don't take it. Great man, not so great of a class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: REL201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at DePqaul. Had him for 201 and he offered to do an independent study with me for a class I really needed, which was an exellent learning experience. He truly cares about his students, is patient and challenging and always willing to help. People who took him for 298: that class is supposed to be exceptionally difficult!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2008<br>Class Name: REL298<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wellman's class is unecessarily difficult. There are excessive expensive blackboard printouts and the papers/tests are at the same time and extremely stressful. He is very intelligent and tells interesting side notes. You have to give 100% in this class, it feels much more on the graduate level. If you don't need it, DON'T TAKE IT!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this class personally.  Yes, you do have to post two questions to BlackBoard 24 hours prior to each class which is a pain, but not that difficult.  The readings aren't that necessary.  You can read a little bit and still manage to post a good question.  Grade is based off of 3 essays so if you're a good writer you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2008<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst class I've ever taken @ DePaul! This is the first time I've not enjoyed a class at this school. He tries so hard to be transparent that it makes him unclear. He has a very UNREALISTIC view of the world, and believes religion is the medium to solving major world issues. He doesn't allow for debate and fishes for HIS answers from the students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have to agree with the past few comments about the condesending and arrogant nature of Wellman. I dropped the class. I couldn't take it anymore. The computer printouts are worthless and cost a fortune and you have to post responses on Blckbrd for every single class, so you have no breathing room in this class! Larry Raspison is overrated!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2008<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unclear. Helpful only if you call his cell phone. Does not believe any students come close to being as smart as him. Perhaps the worst class I have taken at Depaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2008<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wellman is condescending. he is constantly &quot;fishing&quot; for answers in class and will randomly call on people to define broad terms in the most specific way. Also he asks all students to read at least a 1000 pages of textbook material on blackboard. I would not recommend him unless you want to leave every class extremely frustrated.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2008<br>Class Name: REL201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was very engaging and seemed to care about his students. His attendance policy is strict- you can only miss two classes. There are only 2  papers and they are only 4 pages. You only have to read enough to be able to ask two questions about it. Easy class that you can learn a lot from.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2008<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is very smart and engaging. Although he may seem intimidating at first, he's the most friendliest and helpful teacher at DePaul. He does assign at lot of readings, but you really don't have to read them. u have to write 3 essays and post 2 questions on Blackboard. There are no tests in his class!u will def learn a lot in his class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: REL102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wellman is a great teacher. Yes, he can be hard at times but it's throughout the papers. At times he can be vague, but it's only because he wants you to figure it out for yourself. There's readings every class that you don't really have to do. Just skim the pages and have something interesting to say.

There are 3 papers which are 25% of your grade, you have to post 2 questions on blackboard 24 hrs. before every class as part of your participation grade.

As long as you act like your interested during his lectures and pay attention you will do fine.

Almost impossible to get A in this class. Only 2 out of 80 ppl got A- and rest average out  a C-. Not very clear to what he expects from you.
