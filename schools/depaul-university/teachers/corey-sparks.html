HE ASKS FOR A SUBMISSION DRAFTS AND GIVES US COMMENTS BUT WHEN YOU FIX WHAT HE SAYS HE STILL DOESNT GIVE YOU AN A ON IT. CLASS WAS VERY LAID BACK AND HAD SOME REALLY INTERESTING COMMENTS ABOUT TOPICS THAT LED INTO TANGENT SUBJECTS. COOL TEACHER OVERALL</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice and funny guy. It was his first year, so he was learning as he was going along. Not very clear about what he wanted, but was willing to take the time to answer questions. Attendance isn't a huge deal. I would recommend him if you're looking for a relaxed class atmosphere. Keep in mind this rating is based on his first quarter at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a really nice guy and led some interesting discussions but they had nothing to do with what you were learning. Also, he's new, so he did not really know what he wanted out of the class or assignments so essay prompts were extremely vague. He was really hard to please and didn't have a set of expectations yet. I learned nothing from the class</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
