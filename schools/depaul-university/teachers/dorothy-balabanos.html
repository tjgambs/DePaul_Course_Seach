She is definitely a hard grader and has a lot of assignments packed into one course. Attendance is necessary and she encourages participation so reading is necessary. She offers advice on the "real world" and is very subjective. Would I take her again? Probably not. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2015<br>Class Name: PRAD335<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She encourages in class participation so you have to read. Assigns very long assignments and many exam questions. No objective just subjective and theory questions for exams, so if you do not know the answers, you will fail. She is too demanding. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2015<br>Class Name: ORGCULTURE<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>The workload is not overwhelming- go to class, read the texts (a must), complete your assignments, and participate in class (there are tons of group assignments). The professor is great- always available and willing to assist. She elaborated on her own experiences (very applicable and informational) and assigned relevant reading assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD335<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a very hard class. I met with the teacher several times outside of class to get clarification on assignements, which resulted in more confusion and bad grades. HARD grader and expects too much. She also talks a lot about her own company, which has nothing to do with the class. This class was miserable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD355<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is brutal.  Basically she expects you to memorize 5000 pages of articles, pages out of the book, and power points for the final and mid term.  Her homework are more like 5 pages essays and she does not receive constructive criticism well.  Find someone else!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD335<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard grader who comes off as pretentious. Talks a lot about herself and her work in the industry. Discussions encouraged but ideas that don't mesh with her own are often glossed over. Extremely hard and long tests that are short answer and essay only. Gives a lot of work to students, doesn't seem to realize her class the only class they're taking.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD335<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Show up to class, do the homework (which, by the way, isn't that difficult), write the papers, scan the readings and you will be fine. If you go to her and ask for help instead of whining to yourself you will definitely be better off. The course material is not difficult, but her tests can be a bit long and tiring for your hand.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD335<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never been more frustrated with a class or teacher. She is one of those teachers who does not realize that along with her class you have at least 3 others, not to mention organizations outside of school. She is obsessed with in class pointless group work, and the homework is basically a short essay for multiple questions. TAKE SOMEONE ELSE!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD335<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not easy.  She is impossible to understand when she comments on your papers or tests so you really dont kno what she wants from you. Her notes are awful and state what you wrote, not how to fix it.  She does not explain her methods or her teachings very well HW is every class and her point system is flawed. NOT ALLOWED 2 MISS EVEN 1 CLASS STAY AWAY</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Balabanos is one of favorite teachers.  She really goes out the way to help those who want her help.  She knows the field and has a passion for it.  If you study and do good on the group campaign you will be fine.  Don't wait last minute to study!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
