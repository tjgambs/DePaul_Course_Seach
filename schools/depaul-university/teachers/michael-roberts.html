His exams are tough, but they're curved and there are plenty of other graded assignments. I learned more in this class than all my others combined this quarter. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a hard teacher. His study guides aren't consistent with whats on the tests, meaning that he will test you on a whole range of topics, not just whats on the guide.He also doesn't respond well to e-mails. For an LSP class he is awfully tough when it comes to the tests. Additionally, he didn't really help us review for the test.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class and cool professor. Read the book b/c questions about it are on the exams which are kind of tough. I agree with all positive comments written here.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor and great class. Wish all my professors cared as much about students as he did. Test are kind of hard so study. He makes the history of blues fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Roberts is a great guy. Super genuine, really cares about DePaul and its students. This class was a lot of memorization of artists and their styles of playing, not exactly what I was expecting. We didn't listen to as I had hoped. The final/midterm were pretty detai-oriented, so definitely read the study guide.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class and nice professor.  Disagree that he didn't specify stuff in the syllabus.  It was actually very detailed and he covered it multiple times with the class.  If you like rock music or the blues, then you'll enjoy the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is knowlegable about the topic of the class, however his delivery fails to interest you. It is mostly a history class and not very interactive. Nor does he specify certain aspects of the syllabus. The class in general is not as interesting as it may sound.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Explore Chicago Blues was a great class with a pretty cool teacher. He was very knowledgable and passionate about the blues and it showed in his teaching. He cared about the students and offered plenty of opportunities for feedback on assignments. Field trips were fun. Class was fun and fairly easy if you read the textbook and study!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2009<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Equal parts blues and rock 'n roll.  If you have any interest in rock 'n roll history you will love this class.  Super cool guy and fun field trips too!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2008<br>Class Name: ISP116<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>only cl;ass i looked forward to.  funny and nice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very laid back professor.

I left the class knowing a lot more about rock and appreciation for blues.  By far the best prof and best class I ever took at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't know anything about the blues before taking his class.  He knows a lot about Chicago and music.  I actually bought some blues music because of his class.  He's very cool and a really nice guy.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
