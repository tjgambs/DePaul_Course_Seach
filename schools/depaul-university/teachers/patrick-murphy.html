	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

If you post something on Bb or send him an email, he'll probably get back to you within an hour (unless it's like 3 AM). If you're having problems in his class, go talk to him, and he'll fix them. Watch out though! Midterm and final are hard - I got 100 on both, but I did the reading!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The BEST professor I have ever seen at Depaul. He is professional, ethical, and really cool at the same time. He brings real-world experience and the case study to class. His exams are tough because he wants students to seriously learn Management and the subject is interesting as well. It's a fun class & he turns the class into an organization.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>never thought I would lead a consulting team, and advise a successful entrepreneur...during college.  the class is real-world and professor treats students exactly as consultants, making you learn hard lessons.
