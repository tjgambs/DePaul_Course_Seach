He leads awesome discussions which help a ton with our essays. He has a lot of passion on the subject and is pretty lenient and understanding most of the time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2013<br>Class Name: ABD235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kohli's one of my favorite professors at DePaul. He's a fantastic lecturer, genuinely kind to his students, and always engaging. He can be a tough grader, so make sure to put in the effort and participate in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, the class was pretty interesting especially for a four class! He is very detailed and expects a lot out of you. You read two books that are quite enjoyable and write a total of 5 short essays. It's not an easy A, but if you do the work you'll get a good grade. Great Professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2012<br>Class Name: ABD208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amor Kohli was one of my BEST professors at DePaul. He is chilled as long as you communicate and dont' take advantage! Tough assignments, but always willing to help and address your concerns!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: ABD208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really amazing teacher. You'll definitely learn alot and he keeps class super interesting. You won't WANT to ever miss a class. Work isn't too hard or abundant, but he does expect a lot from you and to live up to your potential. Just do the work and you'll do fine. One of the best teachers at DePaul for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2010<br>Class Name: ABD235<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's definitely a LEGIT teacher.  A very soulful guy and is very well read in what he teaches.  He is a hard grader and expects top notch work but if you at least read enough and really focus on the lectures you'd be good for the most part</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2010<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class discussions! Understanding if you miss a class or turn an assignment in late as long as you let him know and explain what is going on and ask for an extension on the assignments. Homework consists of a lot of reading and analyzing novels, but very helpful in explaining.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: ABD235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Kohli gives interesting lectures.  He asks the class to answer questions instead of always talking. He is a pretty easy grader, given that you do the work and show that some effort was put into it.  Only two formal papers the entire quarter; pop quizzes on readings and requires online posts.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2008<br>Class Name: ISP104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I have had thus far at DePaul. I had him for a Langston Hughes focal point, and I learned more not only about Langston Hughes, but his poetry, life, and the social movement of the time.  There is a lot of reading and writing, but you learn tons. Take Kohli for sure. He's even helped me with projects in other classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2007<br>Class Name: ENG111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>smart, fun, and HOT.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2007<br>Class Name: ABDSECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jazz and the Diasporic Imagination: Even for those not interested in the topic, professor Kohli provides readings and insight so all can participate in discussion and excel in course work. Prof. Kohli is very knowledgeable and is great to talk to outside of class about course work or other topics related to the class. Good sense of humor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>African American literature in Chicago: Kohli was okay.  I did not enjoy the topic all that much, plus it was a four hour class which was horrible!!!  (dont take a four hr class, esp. if it is a boring subject!!!)  We read alot of books, but the field trips were interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: ABD249<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jazz and the Diasporic imagination.  Great class - awsome prof.  Super interesting topic and good music selections played in class. There was a lot of reading a lot of reading but the discussions rocked.

His classes are a break from the norm and everyone gets into discussions. He is also very interesting and easy to pay attention to. I most definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: ENG101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he was pretty good, but a tight ass marker...i gotta make sure u hand in all the stuff he asks for. but other than that hes a pretty cool guy, u will find he gets in lengthy class dicussions..!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: ABD139<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good teacher, very though provoking.

His discussions about race are very thought provokinga nd challenging. One of the best teachers at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This cat knows his stuff and he expects that you do to, hence the heavy reading. He lectures, but mostly asks questions aimed at testing your knowledge of the topics at hand. Towards the end of the quarter, his questions seem vague because he expects the class to have knowlwedge enough of the material to ask and answer all the right questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2005<br>Class Name: SOPHSEMINAR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is very interesting. He does not give you an answer. He makes you figure it out on your own and if it just sounds good then you will get a good grade. The only thing that is a little much are the bogus reflections you write about once or twice a week after reading. Just make it sound good as long as it sounds good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2005<br>Class Name: BLACKSTUDIES<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, dont come to him with trite clichés.  Most of the grades for the class were essays.  Make sure you understand the 4 or 5 major concepts he presents...otherwise your ****ed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>cool teacher. sparked some good in class discussions.  not hard at all.  barely read for his class but still got a &quot;b&quot;.  as long as you speak up ever once in a while you'll be fine. very approachable, has a lot of intersting knowledge.  i'd take him again</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: ABD245<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor...yeah, it's a lot of reading, but welcome to college :-) The reading is interesting and he explains anything you don't understand...and yes, you do have to come to class or else you're stuck, but that's what you're paying for so...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2004<br>Class Name: ABD245<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Basically this class involves a lot of reading.  Some of the readings you can find on spark notes but most of them you have to do on your own.  He is a very easy grader and gives you many chances to boost your grade.  He also really likes to talk and see you outside of class around campus.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very fair grader...as long as you involve yourself in the discussions and can write a decent paper-you will be fine and get an A.

HE HAS ALOT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT AFRICAN DIASPORA. THE BOOKS FOR THE CLASS ARE NOT EASY READING MOSTLY BUT THEY ARE VERY VERY INTERESTING.

Yeah, it's a lot of reading, but what do you expect...it's cross-listed as an English class, too. If you register for the class, you must be aware that it's a LITERARY class--you know, reading&#63;&#63;&#63; Anyway, really great class, so glad I took it, would definitely take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: ABD<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a pretty cool teacher. Alot of reading, but we talk about it during class during our discussions. Discussions are cool, but he can be pretty unclear at times. He needs to learn how to be clear and concise when asking questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: ABD208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy. Knows a lot about black lit/history. Initially the discussions were excellent, but they started to lose some of their stamina, as his questions became more and more vague and confusing. But all in all, take his class only if u love 2 read and can handle serious reading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: ABD245<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher, makes students interested in the readings.
