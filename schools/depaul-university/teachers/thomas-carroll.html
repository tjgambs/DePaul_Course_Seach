I was nervous after reading some reviews, but he is one of the best professors I've had at DePaul. His lectures are fast so you have to pay attention, but he is clear with what is on the exams-so study, do the homework, and definitely practice and you'll be fine. If he sees you put in effort he'll want to help you succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2015<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Fast lectures and sometimes not clear. Do the homework and study the long problems and you should be fine. I'm not the best student, so it says a lot about this guy.

Just focus on the long problems he goes over in class and do some conceptual learning in myfinancelab and you'll be fine for the tests. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2015<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Carroll is not the easiest professor, but certainly not the hardest. Make sure you do the hw appropriated to the lectures.  All hw is due at date of midterm then date of final. If you pay attention in class, no problem. Dull at times and funny at others. If you like finance, you'll enjoy him. If not serious about finance, choose alternate prof </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2015<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Miss 1 class and you're in the world of hurt, weekly wsj quizzes are easy once you figure it out. MUST have good note taking skills because there is a lot to be covered. do the hw for the sake of understanding the material. he's fast in his lectures, too fast in fact for you to even think about what you don't understand, i dont regret taking him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2015<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: WD</div><div id="right"><div>Rather than teaching the professor in the middle of class either goes on rants about his past work experiences or has a 10 minute comedy routine that has nothing to do with anything. The exams make no sense but what is worse are his notes. The notes overflow the whiteboard with the writing quality of a 1st grader. Avoid him if you can!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2015<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gives quizzed every class on the WSJ. His tests are tough and he does not curve. He will not meet with you for office hours the week of midterms or finals. Must pay attention in class. Not the best professor but not the worst either. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2015<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was hard for me but I'm not a finance major so that factors in. PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS if you just show up and sit on your laptop, then good luck cramming the night before the test. He is super clear about what is gonna be on the tests and he talks about it all quarter. He is funny and makes you want to be well-liked. not for slackers.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Carroll is among the most helpful if you go to visit him in office hours, and he's very friendly (most of the time I visited him just to discuss markets). You absolutely need to go to lectures to know test material. Know concepts plus steps for the major problems and you will do well on tests, especially with the large curve.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: 310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>He definitely has been my hardest professor at DePaul but my favorite. He does go pretty quick in class and does tend to jump around a lot. But, if you go to his office hours, he's super helpful and explains everything perfectly. HE DOES CURVE TESTS.   The grade breakdown: Homework- 20% Quiz (taken online)- 10% Midterm- 35% Final- 35%</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2014<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not an easy class to take over the summer but I felt he explained everything really well and told us exactly what would be on the exams. He's very knowledgeable and i would definitely take another one of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2014<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>He is unclear and explains material way to fast. He expects you to know the material and talks to you like you have been working in the industry for past 10 years. Very casual in explaining concepts and doesn't write on the board. Make sure you know FIN 310 back and forth no exception. Avoid him if you can at all cost or be ready to teach yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2013<br>Class Name: FIN555SUM2<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Carroll covers a lot of ground in this course.  Some of the classes may seem overwhelming while scratching out notes from the board, but if you read the text before hand, understanding his lecture becomes a lot easier.  He has a dry sense of humor, which I enjoyed, but it's not for everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is difficult, but if you pay attention is not that hard. The Wall Street journal quizzes are a little difficult but you only have to get 3 questions right to get full points. Midterm all questions were straight out of the book, and for the final he gives you all six questions before hand.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2013<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Weekly Wall Street Journal quizzes which are pretty hard. Homework isn't due until the midterm and final but you have to buy the textbook + my econ lab. Exams are fairly easy and he lets you know what will be included. Fair grader. His jokes are typically cheesy and lectures can get dry, but he knows what he's talking about and is a nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good professor. He gives questions on the exam that are way tougher than the hw and the class problems. When he is lecturing, he doesnt give many details to the problems that he is doing. An A is still obtainable but be prepared to teach yourself everything</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's smart and has experience in the industry. You should go to class if you want an A. Even if you don't understand everything he's going over, it will make sense of what you learn in the book. He can't tell when students are asking questions vs. when they're being angsty so he'll usually have a 'smart' reply to everything. would take again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't have anything bad to say about Professor Carroll. He gives example problems that students can relate to, tells you exactly what is going to be on the exams, and curves fairly based on the class average. His jokes might be a little cheesy, but they made finance a little more tolerable. I learned a lot in the class and would take him </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2011<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked this professor. He is so nice to everyone and grades fairly. The class was not too hard; some of the cases were though. But he would answer questions, gives us a lot of time to work in our groups, and grades nicely. The class was so much fun!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2011<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does not write clear notes. He has a weird way of curving the exams. He tells you whats going to be on the exams but the questions on the exams are different from the homework and class problems. he tries to give smart remarks when people ask him questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2011<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not recommended. His teaching style consisted of rapidly writing notes on the chalk boards, not pausing to answer questions or clarify difficult points, etc. His grading system is a black box. For the case studies he just assigned random grades with no apparent rhyme or reason.

Very fair grader on cases and final exam. After 15 courses at Depaul, Carroll is definitely one of the top you'll find.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2011<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Learned so much from this class. Wish I was majoring in Finance or he taught classes in my major. Definitely the best professor I have had at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Carroll usually runs through presentation slides and draws some equations on the board. You probably won't learn much from class, but if you do all the homework and read the book, you will be able to get a good grade in his class. He grades very fairly and has a unique way to curve exam scores.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice person, terrible instructor.  His teaching style is basically reading directly off the publisher's PowerPoint slides.  If you want to sit through 3 hours of someone clicking through 100 to 200 slides a night, go with Carroll.  If you actually want to learn finance go with another instructor.  Cases & exams were difficult, but fairly graded.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Very interesting. Is a HUGE help if you attend office hours. Relates the work to real life experiences which is helpful. Very straight forward. If you attend the class, do the work and listen to what he says you should be able to get a great grade. Really enjoyed his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not the most in depth teacher but is very straight forward and prepares you for what you need to know.  He strays from the book and provides his own examples which can be confussing to some.  If you are ok with math and aren't scared of finance you will be fine.  His tests are easy, and grades a little harder on the cases.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2010<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly interesting teacher. Provides examples with real-life experience. Tells you exactly what will be on the test. The two people below are obviously stupid. He tells you what you need to know and there is no reason not to get a high A in the class. He is also very willing to help out during office hours.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
