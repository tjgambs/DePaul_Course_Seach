Easily 100-250 pages of reading for each class. Unclear grading criteria. Very egotistical of his 9+ books. Discussion in class is torture. Very subjective overall.  Can send in drafts of papers for review before final submission. Understanding when things out of your control interfere with completing schoolwork.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: HST173<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher, has clear expectations on what he wants from his students. Just spend a couple hours each week reading the chapters and watch the online lectures to complete an easy weekly quiz. Some assignments can get stacked up around the same time as other classes but that is to be expected in college.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2014<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class consisted of 15 multiple choice quizzes, 5 graded discussions, 2 exam assignments each with 5 essay questions that have to be minimum two pages (exactly 20 pages of work) Then a four page cumulative take home final. Plus another separate four page paper and he is not an easy grader. My advice don't take his class especially in the summer.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2014<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class consisted of 15 multiple choice quizzes, 5 graded discussion questions,  2 exam assignments each with 5 essay questions that have to be minimum two pages (exactly 20 pages of work) Then a four page cumulative take home final.

Half online, half in class. It was also a night class. Really boring but you can get through it. If you like hearing someone humble brag about their achievements, this class is for you.

Expect to write several long papers. Has a high writing standard but offers help and actually doesn't grade too hard. If you are diligent and participate in class you'll be fine. Downsides: not many details on assignment instructions, TONS of reading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2011<br>Class Name: HST277<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely intelligent IN HIS FIELD, but ultimately I tend to take criticism of my &quot;writing mechanics&quot; more seriously from rhetoric or discourse faculty - specifically when addressed via e-mail by the good professor utilizing the wrong form of &quot;you're.&quot; Not worth the damage to my GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2011<br>Class Name: HST399<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took his capstone section my last quarter at DePaul. Prof. Mockaitis is a smart dude. He literally knows everything. He's able to combine numerous disciplines in the field of history, thus, making a very compelling and interesting class. I wish I took his classes more often.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2011<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy. Discussion style class focused on Nazi Germany.  He almost always kept class interesting. The papers weren't too hard and the reading wasn't too dense. Highly recommend this class.  He will definitely improve your ability to think critically!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2011<br>Class Name: HST277<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting lectures. It was a night class, so a little difficult to pay attention the whole time.  Exams were all in class essays - must study!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2009<br>Class Name: HIST292<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unclear.

He thinks he's brilliant and loves the way he writes, so he docks points if he doesn't like your writing style. He really knows his subject, though, and the workload isn't terrible if you keep up with it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Thinks his class is the only one you are taking. He gives you only two days to read literally hundreds of pages. He expects you to read several novels during the course and write long papers on them. The workload is huge! Yes, you do learn a lot about Nazi German, but at a great cost to your free time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: HST330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  Very articulate, and if there is a final he will give you the exact copy on the first day of class.  No surprises.  Take him, you'll learn something.  Only issue with him is that he hates laptops in the classroom.  Oh well</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2008<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>After reading some other comments, I would like to say the following. He is challenging because this is college. Wake up people someone is paying 8 grand every ten weeks for your bum to be at DePaul. He is a great professor and I feel I got educational bang for my buck. If the prospect of reading scares you...you shouln't be in college!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2008<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Some colleges require laptops in class.  This old man bans them from his room.  I guess as a history teacher he is stuck in the 17th century.  Lectures in the most boring tone.  Requires 2 written pages per week plus a four page paper which requires you to reach a 300+ page book. He is cocky, rude, and arrogant towards students.  He should be fired</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: HIST292<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor so far. Very nice about snow storms and being sick, is funny in a highly intelligent way. Not just lecture actually involves students in discussions. take him if you get the chance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: HISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a smart guy, but has a huge ego. Overheard in the post office: &quot;I have a Ph.D. and yet I cant open a mail box&quot;... insisted that we call him &quot;Dr.&quot; sure it's respectful but he lectured us on how he deserved to be called Dr... as a future medical school student I thought it was a bit funny. Still, smart guy. Take him or leave him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: HST277<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was looking foreward to his class on war & peace but its obvious he has favorites and likes to hear his own voice talk. Also don't bring your laptop to his class or he'll kick you out.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2007<br>Class Name: HST397<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mockaitis is one of the best and brightest professors at DePaul and I highly recommend him. The class was very low pressure while keeping the pressure on the papers which he offers more help than other professors on anything you need help on. Although he is kinda tough, you will learn a lot but only if you put forth the work. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2007<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of the harder honors classes, and he is one of the harder honors profs. Requires a lot of reading, and grades papers hard... at first. Towards end of quarter loosens up. Doesn't explain due dates very well though, but you can send him rough drafts!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he really knows his stuff and he really cares about his students. just participate and youll be fine. mayeb nto the easy a prof but he is cool! kind abig ego though...but hes cool!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2007<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great at teaching, bad at being a teacher.  extremely interesting lectures but refuses to communicate with students. really just likes to hear his own voice in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: HST397<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult to write papers, but interesting class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2007<br>Class Name: HST331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't get why anyone would give Prof. Mockaitis bad ratings.

It was very informative and Mr. Mockaitis was very funny in a strange cynical way.  He had a lot of nice anicdotes to tell and always prepared the lectures in an organized, comprehensible manner.  I thought that the tests were a bit random, but a little extra research never hurt anybody.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2006<br>Class Name: HISTORY218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's pretty good, you have to pay some attention.

Not clear about assignments- will make you think guidelines are easy, then hack the hell out of it while grading. Not willing to help students outside of class.

Full of generalizations. Name a trendy leftist theory and he has incorporated it into his watered-down,banal, blandly liberal worldview.

He tries to act all high and mighty like he knows everything, but is not willing to help his students. AT ALL.

We had to write 8 papers over the 5 week course or 10 classes. However, he gives you (at the beg of qtr)what he will test you on.  Study that and do your papers...you will get an A.

Prof. provided help as needed.

Lectures all class but he lets students discuss anything that needs clarity and also uses powerpoint. He is tough on grading the papers and exams but if you enjoy history take him.
