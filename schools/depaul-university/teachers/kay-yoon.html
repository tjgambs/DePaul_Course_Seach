He cares immensely for her students and wants you to do well.  Be prepared to read and there is quite a bit of work, as well.  However, the workload is pretty evenly spread over the quarter.  Kay is very organized, and you will learn a great deal from her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC358<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very helpful with everything! You have to read for every class period because there is a quiz, but most of it is common sense. You also do a group project throughout the entire quarter, but it's with the same group of people and it's split up really well. It's steady work but not too demanding.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Yoon is an amazing teacher. This was my first semester transferring to Depaul and her method of teaching made sense. She doesn't confuse anybody and she goes over everything thoroughly. I love being in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's so helpful and understanding.  The class seems a little intimidating the first day, but it's actually really easy.  Hopefully you get a good group or else you'll be stuck doing a lot of work on your own.  Choose a topic you're interested in.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures are super dry but she doesn't mind if you're on your computer/tablet in class. She is an easy grader. But, she is literally one of the nicest and caring professors at DePaul. Take her small group class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2013<br>Class Name: ORG212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Small group comm- easy class and very very sweet teacher. A little boring, but she's just so nice!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC317<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If anyone's heart is in the right place, it is Kay's. I took ORGC317 online and she was always immediately responsive with questions and did everything she could to ensure the class was going smoothly. She has creative pieces in, such as an online simulation, which I really enjoyed. Lots of group work- but it was mapped out ahead of time! Thumbs up</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS358<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kay is incredibly nice/helpful. You have to read (weekly quizzes) & lectures are BORING. Quite a bit of group work. Easy but not a lot of feedback on grades - i.e.  you'll get a 92 each week with no explanation of why its not 100 or how to get 100. Its easy if you study for exams & can stay awake! She also writes great recommendations.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS358<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kay is such a nice professor.  Her lectures were clear and for the most part the class was easy- There's a quiz every week from the readings but if you just read the summary at the end of each chapter you pretty much get the idea.  Her class can get boring at times, and have to do a group project</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS316<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing prof. I've had 2 classes with her and am enrolled to take a third one with her.  She is nice, gives minor amounts of hw (aka great for procrastinators like me). Has weekly quizzes that you can get an A on with only doing 5-10 mins of work/week. You have to try to not get an A in her class. The greatest thing is that I leaned a ton from her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: COM211<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kay was really nice. She is very soft spoken and this class was SOOO easy. You basically had to... do a small project in the beginning with a group of your choice and then she picks the groups for you later in the class. My friend missed about 12 of her classes and he somehow still pulled off a B-. She is really nice though and very understanding..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2007<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the most devastatingly boring class i've taken so far at depaul. if you hate group work (2 presentations + paper), this class is not for you. 50% of your grade is group work, so pick a nice group or you're screwed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2007<br>Class Name: CMN396<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The only way I passed this class is because Professor Yoon is seriously awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2006<br>Class Name: CMN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very prepared and nice professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: CMN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a very nice person. her expectations are clear, and there are many quizzes/hw, but its all relatively easy. just do the work and you'll be fine. shes very calm and sticks to the syllabus. i would take her again for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: DECISIONMAKING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice teacher. a lot of assignments but no midterm. interesting class. would take her for another class.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
