He will help you in any way possible and he is very clear explaining financial concepts to people who have no idea what finance is(like me). I'm very pleased with the end result of this class I learned a lot thanks to him .</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful guy and knowledgeable in finance and economics. Tough class but he tries his best to help by providing past exams and a way to get extra credit by finding errors in them which will help jump your grade by one level. He is very fast in replying to emails and he explains the answer to any question in details. Overall take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2011<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher. Has a strong background in Financial Math and Financial Engineering. Tests are tough, but no surprises. I took the class in the 5 week format and wish there was more time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor, very challenging. Definitely take him if your interest is finance or financial engineering. He will prepare you for later course work in the Econ/MSF/MSCF programs. Even if this is not your area, you can still do well. Several marketing/management MBA's with no quantitative backgrounds earned A's on the midterm.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not bad for someone who isn't a professional teacher.  The class started out rough but he made adjustments and improved the format over time.  Sometimes he went off into the weeds instead of focusing more on the critical issues.  Overall, just ok.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
