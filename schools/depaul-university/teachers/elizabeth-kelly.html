Two-faced, for sure. Re-writes are abound, but offers little in constructive commentary unless you reiterate her talking points.  Otherwise it's a great course with a lot of new detail and PLENTY to learn.  If you have testicles, you'd better be a feminist: OR ELSE!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSC328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's an awesome Professor!

Interesting and funny. Assigns a lot of reading but she lets you do unlimited rewrites so there's no reason for you not to do well in her class. However, she does play favorites and takes participation VERY seriously. Otherwise, I truly enjoyed her lectures and learned a lot in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: PSC230ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is my favorite professor at DePaul. She is not only a great teacher that really sucks you into the material of the class, she is also a great person who takes the time to get to know you on a personal level. She is a true role model for other teachers and I do look up to her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: PSC217<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>:-(</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2005<br>Class Name: WMS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is awesome and really smart (she went to Harvard).  Be sure to read because she hates it when nobody reads.  As long as you read and speak at some point you'll get an A.  She offers unlimited rewrites so if you get anything less than a B it's because you're a retard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: WMS338PSC369<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was an amazing teacher all around.  I loved her interest in the topic and her general concern to keep her students interested as well.  I went to every class, because each one was a great experience - discussions, critical thinking.  I think although she is a teacher that expects a lot from her students, it's still the best class I've had yet.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2005<br>Class Name: WMS352<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knitting was fun but at times she was mean to some students. she favors one studets over the other, but luckily, she favored me. if you were not favored, she was harsh and crical.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2005<br>Class Name: PSC217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's enthusiastic about what she teaches.

(She's my advisor.) She has an unending wealth of historical information and is a dynamic lecturer. But I'm unimpressed by the theoretical and analytical sophistication of her courses. Tends to adore but underestimate DePaul students and possesses a paternalistic attitude toward her &quot;darlings.&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2005<br>Class Name: WOMENDSTUDIES<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: WMS354<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have also had Dr. Kelly for ISP 200 & PSC 230.
