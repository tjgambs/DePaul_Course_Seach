Was a great class.  He expects A LOT of work on projects.  Pay attention to details.  I learned a lot about sports campaigns.  Best part - Our group won the campaign and I got an internship.  I really feel that Professor Devlin helped prepare me for the interview to get a job because of this sports class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: 102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Huge Alabama Football fan! but in regards to classes, really clear about what he expects from you and helps you get an A. He basically gives you questions for the 3 exams he gives. I really learnt a lot even though I was an accounting major. I didn't buy a textbook and learnt right before the exams, and I got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD291<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy, almost stupidly easy. Yes, he is an effective instructor, but if you have any background in research or high school level stats whatsoever, you won't get anything out of this class. Don't buy the textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2014<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE HIM. Gives you what is pretty much exactly on the test, lectures are very engaging. Ended class early a lot which is cool. Attendance is a must for him and also some participation, only thing is he doesn't like the use of technology in class (even though he's young) so be prepared to write. Honestly an easy A!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD291<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such an incredible professor. His lectures include a lot of information and he lets you know what is important, but they are also hilarious and class goes by very quickly. He is more than willing to provide any help you need and he seems to really care about his students. Would recommend taking this class one hundred percent. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2013<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Very cool and relatable.  Made the intro class interesting.  He doesn't just lecture from a book.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
