I enjoyed going to his class every day and really learned a lot. He will call on you just to hear your opinion. I highly recommend taking him. By far my favorite professor at DePaul. He grades slightly hard on the midterm and final, youll get a B if you went to every class but you MUST do the reading to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2015<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hibbard is very engaging. My class grade was 40% midterm, 40% final, and 20% paper. If do the readings, participate in class, study for the midtermfinal, and type a decent paper, you should get an A. He is easy to talk to and has a lot of experience, so go to his office hours if you have time! Great discussions!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hibbard was great! He always stimulated interest in class and covered very thought provoking topics. The only homework was to read which wasn't bad and the midterm and final are easy as long as you read, show up to class, and pay attention. I definitely recommend taking professor Hibbard if you get the chance!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2014<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm, final, and final paper are all the grades you have. Midterm and final include a fairly long review sheet, but if you take the time to prepare the exams are pretty straight forward. Hibbard is really inspirational and a great lecturer, a privilege to be in his class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2014<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hibbard is so fun! He makes class enjoyable and I look forward to it. There's a midterm, final and final paper. A lot of outside reading, but it is clearly explained in class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2014<br>Class Name: 390<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Hibbard is a pretty good professor. His style allows for a more comfortable atmosphere to discuss some difficult topics. Definitely makes you think. Great material choices.

He is very passionate about the material and does a great job in class of keeping everyone engaged and interested. Do the readings, participate in class discussions, and PAY ATTENTION and it is impossible not to finish the course with an A. He even provides a study guide for the Midterm and Final with all the topics covered.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2013<br>Class Name: PLCP3500501<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If your a politics major, then you will like his class. Many of politics friends who took this class with me enjoyed it, but as for me, he put me to sleep everyday with his lectures. Readings are very lengthy and there are many of them.  There were about 6 essays. One 5-7 and five 2-4 pagers as well as a final. "Let me digress for just 2 seconds"</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2013<br>Class Name: PLCP3500501<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If your a politics major, then you will like his class.

Before coming to his class I was intrigued by international relations.  After his class, I am even more so.  After one class with him, you'll wish you could have him for every class at DePaul.  Show up to class, read, and participate.  This guy makes you want to learn.  Take his class!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2012<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree that he is an amazing teacher, lectures are super interesting and you can tell he's really passionate about what he's teaching. However; he's a really smart guy, so its difficult to understand what he's talking about sometimes with no background on the subject matter. Also, difficult grading system- 40% midterm, 40% final, 10% paper.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>took him for 9/11 BEST FOCAL POINT COURSE OFFERED AT DEPAUL. you will learn so much about 9/11. most things you didnt even know. participation is practically required. if you dont like to share your thoughts and opinions i wouldnt recommend it. best professor at depaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for my 9/11 class, GREAT prof.

He made historical material my most interesting class this quarter. He was really helpful when I asked to talk about AFP too. Funny, engaging. Make sure you read. He has favorites, but those are just the students who speak up and know their stuff. It is more of a respect.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took the 9/11 class and it was awesome!

Just don't procrastinate on the papers, study for the final, and you'll be a-ok. The girls in my class all say that he looks like Richard Gere and yeah I agree. Nonetheless, he's one cool cat who has an immense amount of knowledge.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2010<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an amazing prof.

He's got a great personality, laid back teaching style, passion for politcs, and has high respect for his students. Don't mistake this for not doing work, however, as reading is an important element of class and writing constitutes the majority of your final grade. I love this guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2008<br>Class Name: PSC142<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hibbard is an amazing teacher: Funny, tons of experience in his field, makes the material interesting. Every political science major should take him. Reading is easy, he goes over it in class most of the time. Cute, too!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2007<br>Class Name: POLYSCI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>by far my favorite prof at depaul. he is a must take. i took three of his classes and he has the same style. notes everyday and midterm and final. pretty tough grader but prepares you well. if you are polysci major you must take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2007<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher.

I now can give in opinion on the war in Iraq. Mind blowing how more cultured and knowledgeable I am. Go to class, jot down things that he may repeatedly and soak it all in. He will call on you and ask for your opinion. As long as you keep an open mind, you won't be sorry! Best teacher I've had at DP!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is of the gods. Best class ever: funny, encourages discussion, generates interest in the topic, very knowledgeable. Doesn't badger you with too much work: just one midterm and one final. Oh, and you gotta write a paper about four events you did during the semester, but that's no sweat. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2007<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really helpful and unbelievebly intellegent!!!He knows his stuff and I mean not only about the middle eastern politics but virtually any topic.

The only thing I didn't like was that he expects A LOT from the essay portions in tests (which are worth a lot of pts).  Therefore, you don't know exactly what he is looking for since other than &quot;more than usual&quot;.  He needs to ease up on that part.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2006<br>Class Name: PSC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The above comments say it all. At some point, each student should have a prof. like Hibbard,everyday you will walk out of his class with so much more than u walked in, most interesting, intelligent and nicest teacher i have ever had in my school career.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2006<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best teacher at depaul. if you are a poly sci major than u must take his class. alot of reading but goes over it in class very good. doesnt grade by whether you agree with him or not but by how much of the work you know. i take his class whenever i can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Many good things have been said about this prof. already, so I won't repeat. The most satisfying thing for me was that he was not an idealouge. He was liberal but not so much so to shut down anyone's dissenting argument; he welcomes different opinions and encourages you to think outside the box.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Favorite teacher at DePaul. If you want to or not you become engaged in his lectures and want to do well. Very fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly recommended.  Amusing anecdotes about his days inside Washington.  Friendly, funny, straightforward, approachable, has a following of students who keep on taking him.  Organizes notes well on the board.  Does not seem as passionate about the subject as some DePaul teachers, though.  Has favorites but not distastefully.  You'll like him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a real clear and understanding teacher.  He is well organized and prepared for class.  I love his teaching methods.  Just take good notes and come to class you will do fine in his class.  I think he's the greatest teacher for Middle East Politics.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2005<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Professor who really knows the material and explains it quite well. Class is predominantly lecture with discussion, two papers and a cumulative final. Should be on the short list of DePaul Professors you musttake more than once. Highly Recommended.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
