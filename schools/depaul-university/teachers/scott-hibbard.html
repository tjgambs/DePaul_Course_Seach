He is very passionate about the material and does a great job in class of keeping everyone engaged and interested.

Before coming to his class I was intrigued by international relations.  After his class, I am even more so.  After one class with him, you'll wish you could have him for every class at DePaul.  Show up to class, read, and participate.  This guy makes you want to learn.  Take his class!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2012<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree that he is an amazing teacher, lectures are super interesting and you can tell he's really passionate about what he's teaching. However; he's a really smart guy, so its difficult to understand what he's talking about sometimes with no background on the subject matter. Also, difficult grading system- 40% midterm, 40% final, 10% paper.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>took him for 9/11 BEST FOCAL POINT COURSE OFFERED AT DEPAUL. you will learn so much about 9/11. most things you didnt even know. participation is practically required. if you dont like to share your thoughts and opinions i wouldnt recommend it. best professor at depaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for my 9/11 class, GREAT prof.

He made historical material my most interesting class this quarter. He was really helpful when I asked to talk about AFP too. Funny, engaging. Make sure you read. He has favorites, but those are just the students who speak up and know their stuff. It is more of a respect.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took the 9/11 class and it was awesome!

Just don't procrastinate on the papers, study for the final, and you'll be a-ok. The girls in my class all say that he looks like Richard Gere and yeah I agree.

He's got a great personality, laid back teaching style, passion for politcs, and has high respect for his students. Don't mistake this for not doing work, however, as reading is an important element of class and writing constitutes the majority of your final grade. I love this guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2008<br>Class Name: PSC142<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hibbard is an amazing teacher: Funny, tons of experience in his field, makes the material interesting.

I do like his class very much though, and the way he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I came to class knowing nothing about politics. I now can give in opinion on the war in Iraq. Mind blowing how more cultured and knowledgeable I am. Go to class, jot down things that he may repeatedly and soak it all in. He will call on you and ask for your opinion. As long as you keep an open mind, you won't be sorry! Best teacher I've had at DP!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is of the gods. Best class ever: funny, encourages discussion, generates interest in the topic, very knowledgeable. Doesn't badger you with too much work: just one midterm and one final. Oh, and you gotta write a paper about four events you did during the semester, but that's no sweat. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2007<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really helpful and unbelievebly intellegent!!!He knows his stuff and I mean not only about the middle eastern politics but virtually any topic. BEWARE: His handsome looks tend to be distracting, he is a gem of the PSC Dept at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2007<br>Class Name: PSCMEP<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He Is quite possibly the sexiest teacher at DePaul. Very smart and knows what he is talking about. Just take good notes in class and read some and you'll be just fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2007<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the best teacher i have had at depaul. he really knows his stuff but doesnt force it upon you and encourages discussion. i took him for mideast politics and political islam and he has the same style, notes and lecture everyday, mditerm, and final. you must take this professor, you wont regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2006<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Scott's the man!

What can i say, he's awesome, awesome to the max! Tests are very straightfoward, no surprises whatsoever! You'll enjoy whatever class you take with him, even if it was the history of snails. :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2006<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Flat out one of the best teachers the Political Science department has to offer. All he does is lecture but it is so captivating. Pay attention in class and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2006<br>Class Name: PSY140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great instructor; super nice and has an explosive attitude towards education.  The only thing I didn't like was that he expects A LOT from the essay portions in tests (which are worth a lot of pts).  Therefore, you don't know exactly what he is looking for since other than &quot;more than usual&quot;.  He needs to ease up on that part.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2006<br>Class Name: PSC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The above comments say it all. At some point, each student should have a prof. like Hibbard,everyday you will walk out of his class with so much more than u walked in, most interesting, intelligent and nicest teacher i have ever had in my school career.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2006<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best teacher at depaul. if you are a poly sci major than u must take his class. alot of reading but goes over it in class very good. doesnt grade by whether you agree with him or not but by how much of the work you know. i take his class whenever i can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Many good things have been said about this prof. already, so I won't repeat. The most satisfying thing for me was that he was not an idealouge. He was liberal but not so much so to shut down anyone's dissenting argument; he welcomes different opinions and encourages you to think outside the box.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Favorite teacher at DePaul. If you want to or not you become engaged in his lectures and want to do well. Very fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly recommended.  Amusing anecdotes about his days inside Washington.  Friendly, funny, straightforward, approachable, has a following of students who keep on taking him.  Organizes notes well on the board.  Does not seem as passionate about the subject as some DePaul teachers, though.  Has favorites but not distastefully.  You'll like him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a real clear and understanding teacher.  He is well organized and prepared for class.  I love his teaching methods.  Just take good notes and come to class you will do fine in his class.  I think he's the greatest teacher for Middle East Politics.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2005<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Professor who really knows the material and explains it quite well. Class is predominantly lecture with discussion, two papers and a cumulative final. Should be on the short list of DePaul Professors you musttake more than once. Highly Recommended.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
