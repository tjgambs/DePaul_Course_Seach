			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

She's fun, understanding, and genuinely excited about what she teaches. Papers are serious business content-wise and must be finished, but she isn't overly scrutinizing. If you're easily t'd off by perky attitudes, definately don't take her course -- but that's YOUR shortcoming, not hers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She wasn't bad.  A little too excited by frenh literature, but that's what she teaches.  She is able to interest you about the subject.  Grades decently.  Attendance is mandatory but she cancelled class a lot and allows you to miss up to two classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2009<br>Class Name: HON350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her a few years back, and all I can say is AVOID AT ALL COSTS! She spent an entire class session dissecting a negative RateMyProfessors.com review that she found offensive. She should spend time preparing class sessions and less time checking her profile on here ;) Overall, I found her class to be unbeneficial and her grading to be unfair.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2008<br>Class Name: WMS388<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Queer Theory with Bradshaw, and I have to say that this class was MUCH more intense than I anticipated.  She is a great teacher and does alot with the material, but do not take this course expecting a blow off.  It is cross-listed in Philosphy for a reason!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2008<br>Class Name: WMSS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best teacher I have ever had, hands down. I have had her more than once, and always loved her. Her material is very difficult, but she makes it so easy to understand. If you can, just take her. One warning- don't piss her off!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2008<br>Class Name: WMS300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Bradshaw is an extraordinary teacher and she will inspire you to be a better student and a more well-rounded person.  She has the unique ability to make theory classes fun...and very intellectually satisfying.  She is hilarious in class and her personality just shines through while she teaches.  Y'all have to take Prof. Bradshaw.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: WMS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG I LOVE BRADSHAW! I have had her for a number of classes and she rocks. she has quite a wit and is good at relating the topic to current pop culture. she is easy to talk to and is more than willing to help. you will love her class! I go out of my way to take her classes, but her advicing skills aren't as good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2007<br>Class Name: WMS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Bradshaw is the best!  She breezed through Intro to Women's Studies and made it interesting and easy for everyone.  All you have to do is read some articles and come to class and you will fully understand what is going on.  If you have the opportunity, you should definately take this professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was amazing. I took her for an Edgar Allan Poe focal point and she made that class fascinating. Her main thing is participation so raise your hands and definetely keep up with the readings. You'll love her, she fun and energetic.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really didn't keep my interest. I had her for a focal point class, the Edgar Allan Poe focal point, and half the time we talked about movies that were adapted from Poe stories. I really don't care about that. I wanted to learn about Poe. My knowledge of the subject increased somewhat after taking the class, but not nearly enough for my liking.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: HON300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not entertaining, far from it. Her teaching style is basically her trying to be a ditz in order to try to get our attention: doesn't work! She is too feministic in her views. Everything she assigned was based on feministic themes. She is narrow-minded in much of her thinking. Expect a lot of reading, sarcasm, swearing, and pop quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2007<br>Class Name: WMS388<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Being in her class is like being at Second City. She is hilarious & loves what she teaches, and is good at it.  Readings are very difficult to understand but she explains them. 3 papers due on hard material, but well worth it. Not recommended for non-WMS majors. Very helpful too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2006<br>Class Name: HON300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Bradshaw is anything but entertaining. Her sarcasm becomes too much at times.  Too feministic in her views. Everything assigned tied into feministic themes. Biased in her views and plays favorites. Hard grader, moderate amount of reading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: HON300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I seriously loved her!!  She was so funny and very knowledgeable.

A rare professor who can be comic and entertaining while also confronting complex and challenging material. Especially good at making high-level theory accessible to a diversity of individuals at various stages of intellectual sophistication. U'll wish she was your drinking buddy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>am i the only person who didn't like her class&#63; i expected college level readings rather than high school material.  lots of reading but it was all so remedial - there was no challenge!  she's also an outspoken liberal which is fine but not in this particular setting.  perhaps she'd enjoy teaching a political course rather than literature&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2005<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's great!  Very funny, interesting conversations, good teacher.  Keep up with the reading 'cause her quizes are just SOOOO easy if you've even skimmed it. Fair grader. Lots of reading, but overall a great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bradshaw is a great teacher although I felt a little overwhelmed the first day because of all the reading but stay on top of it and you'll do just fine.  She encourages participation but I barely spoke and still got an A. She totally rocks and she'll keep you laughing.  I highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely good teacher!!!

If you take her class, participate in discussions, not because it effects your grade but just because it makes her happy. She grades fairly and reading quizes are super easy.

However, she is brand new to the professor scene and should strictly be teaching lower level classes for a while until she can step it up. very sensitive and possibly a narrow definition of feminism (with a disregard to the(S)of feminism(s).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2005<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is soo sweet!
