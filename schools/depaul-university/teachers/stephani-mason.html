You will learn more in her class than in any of your other classes at DePaul and she is EXTREMELY helpuful in office hours and via email. My favorite teacher I've had at DePaul, BY FAR. and Im a fin major!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2013<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mason's class is definitely not easy. She is clear during class and explains concepts fairly well. However, her midterm and final are very difficult. They are much more complex than the examples learned in class. The midterm and final are CPA like if not harder. Many people failed and no one got A's. Final project and large curve.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
