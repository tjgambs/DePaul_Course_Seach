Honestly, she makes the class more difficult than it should be;  I was going for a Spanish minor but definitely reconsidered after this, the first day she lectured us on  4 cited papers and a 5-7 min presentation we'd have to do. I could go on, but for your own well being DO NOT take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2015<br>Class Name: SPN205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>Never again.

The amount of homework she gives out is ridiculous and feels more time consuming than actual learning. The lectures can be very long, teachers should be motivating us but instead she always makes everyone feel so small. I would not take another class with her again. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2014<br>Class Name: SPN203<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She changes the syllabus almost every class to the point where no one knows whats going on and gets mad when you ask her about it. The workload is unnecessarily excessive for a nonnative speaker language course. The class itself is a very dry and uninteresting hour and a half which will make you regret taking Spanish altogether. Avoid this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2014<br>Class Name: SPN203<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The workload is ridiculous. I am a Spanish minor, but felt like I was just bombarded with assignments. Definitely no walk in the park. Do I feel more competent with my Spanish? Maybe a little bit. Obviously, college shouldn't be easy, but when I have more homework in this class than all others combined, I start to wonder. Not recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: SPN206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very hard professor but only because she wants you to learn. She literally gives you no choice but to learn. If you don't work hard and make an effort you won't do good. If you actually want to improve your spanish definitely take this class. She grades on improvement and effort not on test scores!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: SPN312<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the hardest professors ever! Several students dropped, one right before the midterm. She relies heavily on text but is so unclear during her explanation of its history and there are 4 essays, 3 due the last few weeks of class. DO NOT TAKE HER if you can help it. She's also a hard grader but says she goes easy. Yeah right!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2013<br>Class Name: SPN305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is definitely not an easy grader. But she is an excellent professor! If you take her class, you will gain so much knowledge. She pushes you to become a better writer, but is always there to help. Additionally, she is very understanding. She takes everything into consideration, so things like consistent attendance and participation really helps</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2013<br>Class Name: 201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is Strict. Don't stereotype. She doesn't like it- At all...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was very unclear on assignment expectations and there was a lot of miscommunication between here and her students. But she was also always willing to help students outside of class and she is incredibly knowledgeable about the Spanish speaking world.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2012<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a horrible experience. If I could go back in time I would NOT take this class. I have never had a professor make me feel so small. There is no communication, no set instructions, no clear agenda, just a big mess that you will regret and your GPA will suffer immensely.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2012<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you love feeling frustrated and confused during class, she's the teacher for you. Spanish is my minor, and honestly I was willing to work, but she changed the syllabus so frequently and then got mad when students had questions. She's not very organized, gets side-tracked, and is not helpful in any way. The movies were interesting, at least.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2012<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She responded to an email so rudely getting angry when addressed without the proper title. How about some clarity on the assignment. Are you kidding me? She has zero respect for her students or their time. DO NOT TAKE HER! If you have any interest in the subject, she will screw it up for you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2012<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I came into this class extremely excited about the subject and she ruined that for me. We teach ourselves all of the subject material, and all we do in class is talk about meaningless topics.  we had to watch 5 movies outside of class. I also had a legit excuse for missing class because of a religious holiday and she was completely uncaring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2012<br>Class Name: SPN323<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is among one of the worst I've had at DePaul. She is absolutely unclear in what she expects from her students. Additionally, she assigns enough work for 3 courses. We were required to read 6 novels and watch 8 full length films. There were also 4 7-page essays assigned, 3 due during finals week.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has HIGH expectations from her students, something that should be a rule from professors.  I learned tons of new things through the chosen books, discussions, and individual meetings.  In fact, what I know from Latin America is thanks to her.  So I say TAKE HER, but if you like mediocrity, then she is not for you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2011<br>Class Name: SPN315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Beltran is brilliant, she knows her subject and really values education.  She has very high expectations from her students and this would not be an easy grade but if you really want to learn something valuable, please take her.  And do all your readings and your work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the hardest teacher ever. She knows what she wants and you are expected to read her mind to know too. Try an avoid her. Also, I found her teaching at times to be mildly offensive.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a strict professor with high expectations. Her class is not easy but i mena you leare a lot thanks to her i have something to sya in my WGS class and SPN. take her if you like to challenge your self but if your the kind that it's looking for an easy class then it's not for you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2010<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very strict and unaccommodating.  Yes, she has high expectations, but she is seeming unequal per student.  I asked her one time if we could meet outside of class, and she said, &quot;I am not going to change your grade&quot;.  She is hands down, the worst professor at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2009<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Here s the thing; AVOID. Plain adn simple, if you can, do not take her. She assigns a ton of work and she is an EXTREMeLY hard grader. I have no idea how she gave me a B when all a got on the quizzes were Ds. No joke, i guess it was a mircle but she ll put you through a lot of unnecessary stress. Please, AVOID her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I've ever had at DePaul. Has extremely high expectations of her students which is fine, but she can't even meet those expectations herself. Always late, never at office hours, never prepared for class, and constantly changing assignment directions/due dates to fit her needs. Extremely unprofessional and just plain rude. AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE PROFESSOR. DO NOT TAKE HER. GIVES TOO MANY READINGS, LIKE TO PICK ON HER STUDENTS AND OVERWHELMS YOU WITH FINALS. SHE GAVE A FIVE PAGE PAPER AND TWO THREE PAGE PAPERS DUE IN THE SAME DAY. HARD GRADER. I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS AT ALL. HORRIBLE TEACHER.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: SPN315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You should be warned that she is a very, very challenging professor. The reading load was unreal. I talked to her outside of class a couple times because I was struggling so much. She's brilliant, and is aware she has super high expectations, but I think her attitude is pretty much deal with it or drop.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is without a doubt, the worst teacher I've ever encountered in my entire school career. She has no sympathy for her students that do not understand the work, she explains things horribly, and if you do not do the million-page reading she assigns daily, you are screwed for her class. Do not take this class if you want a decent GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was real mean but gave out her office hours, but was so unapproachable that you wouldnt want to go.  She showed no respect to anyone elses opinions.  All of your time will be consumed by this class.  Does not explain anything.  Speaks in Spanish ALL the time when it is CLEARLY not spanish class.. avoid at all costs if you want a good GPA</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i personally enjoyed the topics discussed in this class but i believe that she should not be so harsh on freshmen. i am not going to complain about the readings because its college and they were interesting. And for those white boys who said she did not like them for their race, i disagree because i am hispanic and she did not like me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, this class was incredibly hard!! and she said it would be easy at the beginning, whatever you do, do not take this class!!!!She makes you spend soo much money on books that you never talk about!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2008<br>Class Name: SPN207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i took her both ISP 120 and SPN 207.  ISP is alot of essays, books, field trips...its just alot. SPN 207, on the contrary, was a piece of cake. All we do is talk! its great. she's a really good professor too, she knows her stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this teacher if you want a good GPA. She was ridiculous with her grading and overall opinions. I wound up with a C-, all the while she was telling us that if we do the work, we'll be sure to get an A or B.

None of the latinos were there to make friends, so I loved to start class discussions that often left most people pissed off. I probably wrote over 100 pages just for her class this quarter.

My transition to college was rough because of this class. The class was on the Chicano Experience, not on her feminist views, I wish she would have kept that in mind. We learned nothing about the subject. She should NOT teach an ISP class next year. On a brighter note, if you get to know her one on one she's a much better person.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are Hispanic you are fine, she hates white males.  She makes you work hard and grades hard.  She had 3 out of 5 papers due in the last three weeks of class.  I expected a A- or B+ and got a B.

Do the readings so you know what's going on in class. Ask questions if you have them. While this class was a little tough, it wouldn't have been so hard if I had asked questions. Take her if you want to learn and put your tuition to good use!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2007<br>Class Name: SPN205<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID this prof!! She was the hardest B+ ever! As a native speaker, I wanted to learn the grammar but she was NEVER THERE! Our class lost three wks worth of lectures bcuz she was absent.
