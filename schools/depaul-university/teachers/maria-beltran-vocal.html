The amount of homework she gives out is ridiculous and feels more time consuming than actual learning. The lectures can be very long, teachers should be motivating us but instead she always makes everyone feel so small. I would not take another class with her again. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2014<br>Class Name: SPN203<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She changes the syllabus almost every class to the point where no one knows whats going on and gets mad when you ask her about it. The workload is unnecessarily excessive for a nonnative speaker language course. The class itself is a very dry and uninteresting hour and a half which will make you regret taking Spanish altogether. Avoid this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2014<br>Class Name: SPN203<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The workload is ridiculous. I am a Spanish minor, but felt like I was just bombarded with assignments. Definitely no walk in the park. Do I feel more competent with my Spanish? Maybe a little bit. Obviously, college shouldn't be easy, but when I have more homework in this class than all others combined, I start to wonder. Not recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: SPN206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very hard professor but only because she wants you to learn. She literally gives you no choice but to learn. If you don't work hard and make an effort you won't do good. If you actually want to improve your spanish definitely take this class. She grades on improvement and effort not on test scores!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: SPN312<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the hardest professors ever! Several students dropped, one right before the midterm. She relies heavily on text but is so unclear during her explanation of its history and there are 4 essays, 3 due the last few weeks of class. DO NOT TAKE HER if you can help it. She's also a hard grader but says she goes easy. Yeah right!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2013<br>Class Name: SPN305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is definitely not an easy grader. But she is an excellent professor! If you take her class, you will gain so much knowledge. She pushes you to become a better writer, but is always there to help. Additionally, she is very understanding. She takes everything into consideration, so things like consistent attendance and participation really helps</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2013<br>Class Name: 201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is Strict.

If I could go back in time I would NOT take this class. I have never had a professor make me feel so small.

Spanish is my minor, and honestly I was willing to work, but she changed the syllabus so frequently and then got mad when students had questions. She's not very organized, gets side-tracked, and is not helpful in any way. The movies were interesting, at least.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2012<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She responded to an email so rudely getting angry when addressed without the proper title.

We teach ourselves all of the subject material, and all we do in class is talk about meaningless topics.  we had to watch 5 movies outside of class. I also had a legit excuse for missing class because of a religious holiday and she was completely uncaring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2012<br>Class Name: SPN323<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is among one of the worst I've had at DePaul. She is absolutely unclear in what she expects from her students. Additionally, she assigns enough work for 3 courses. We were required to read 6 novels and watch 8 full length films. There were also 4 7-page essays assigned, 3 due during finals week.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has HIGH expectations from her students, something that should be a rule from professors.

Yes, she has high expectations, but she is seeming unequal per student.  I asked her one time if we could meet outside of class, and she said, &quot;I am not going to change your grade&quot;.  She is hands down, the worst professor at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2009<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Here s the thing; AVOID. Plain adn simple, if you can, do not take her. She assigns a ton of work and she is an EXTREMeLY hard grader. I have no idea how she gave me a B when all a got on the quizzes were Ds. No joke, i guess it was a mircle but she ll put you through a lot of unnecessary stress. Please, AVOID her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I've ever had at DePaul. Has extremely high expectations of her students which is fine, but she can't even meet those expectations herself. Always late, never at office hours, never prepared for class, and constantly changing assignment directions/due dates to fit her needs. Extremely unprofessional and just plain rude. AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE PROFESSOR.
