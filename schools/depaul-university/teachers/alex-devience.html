			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Buy Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />

Take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: BLW140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Devience is the man. I was quoting him in my notes more than I actually took notes. It's very important to establish a relationship with him and either go to office hours or talk after class. I didn't do well on the midterm, but he saw my improved effort the second half and rewarded me with an A. Show up, participate, and have fun in this course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attending class WILL improve your grade.  His lectures will be useful information for the mid-term and final exam.  The book alone is insufficient. READ ALL ASSIGNED CHAPTERS.  I got a "B" but if I had put more consistent effort into the class I could have easily earned an "A". The book is necessary and cheaper as a download. Search Amazon.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this class very much so.  The Professor is great, might take some time to get his humor, but his knowledge and experience in law is what made this class enjoyable.  If I have the chance to take more law classes I will definitely look up this Professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class attendance isn't mandatory but he does add points to your midterm & final exam if you participate. His lectures are pretty entertaining and helpful. Go to lectures to know what topics he's focusing on & read the book about those topics to learn everything in detail. He's always helpful & takes the time to answer everything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor.  His humor really keeps you engaged but do not take his comments to heart. Class is only the midterm and final which is all if not most blw classes.  He really encourages class participation.  If you participate he will add more points to your midterma and final. Really interesting class. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class,Great professor. he is the man! he is hilarious and makes his lectures the most comprehensive ever. The book does help, but if you pay attention to his lectures, you should do well. Note that the entire grade constitutes by a midterm and a final. He has a strong sense of humor, don't take him if you get offended easily. awesome class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly recommend him for students considering Law. He takes his class very seriously and doing the reading are vital, as well as keeping up with the questions! I have never considered law in before until taking this class. Not only, was he one of my most favorite teachers, but by far this was my most memorable class yet at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Devience is awesome! He has a great sense of humor and is fun to joke around with, even though his humor can be a little offensive sometimes (he called someone fat in our class). His class is not easy but if you participate a lot he will like you and it will help your grade tremendously.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2012<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great great great class!

He is extremely knowledgeable!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2012<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Extremely helpful and clear. Keep up with the textbook readings and you'll be fine. His sense of humor is an extra added plus, don't take it personal if he talks about you, he does that to everyone. I found it to be highly comical. Take his class. Knowledgeable, helpful and funny guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Devience is a great teacher. The class relies heavily on readings from the text, but you can take away the important parts of the assignments from his lectures. Very straightforward, friendly, and funny. Overall a good teacher and i would take his class again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Some people say that Devience is rude, but I think he's the most hilarious teacher at DePaul for some reason. Class is 45% midterm, 45% final, and 10% class participation. Do the problems and briefs he assigns because they help you alot on the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: LAW201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor you either like or will hate, no middle. Class is 45% mid 45% final 10% par. Book is needed heavily. He models class after intro Law college course not undergrad.Class is harder then anyother Bus.Law 201. Midterm is tough, final is brutal, very tricky needs complex thought. Prof. will give you any grade he wants based on opinion, no joke.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2011<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Devience is amazing! One of my favorites at Depaul so far. He is so funny, I laughed the entire class. Mid & final are 45% each. Mid was pretty easy but I studied a lot and got a 93. Final harder but still ended up with an A. Get on his good side and talk to him about questions, and you're golden.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2011<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Devience has a really dry sense of humor and will pick on you in class. He's only kidding, and it makes the class more interesting. The reading is really dry. The midterm/final is short answer/essay. The midterm was easy, the final was incredibly difficult. He definitely knows law!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2011<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, helpful....

After the first couple of classes you'll love him or hate him. If you can't handle being poked fun at don't take him. He's very understanding & knows his stuff; you'll learn alot from him if u try. Midterm & final are your only parts of your grade so study for them; take good notes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2011<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a funny guy. love him! pretty easy class, midterm and final are short answer</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2010<br>Class Name: BUSLA101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So kind, so helpful, so intelligent.

He is very laid back but he'll teach what he expects on the test. He repeats his exam questions in class discussions more than 2 times, so write it down and study it. Trust me, I didn't do it and now I regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2010<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I have had at DePaul! he will make fun of you and call you out in class so if you take those things personal dont take him, if you know he is just kidding it will be a great fun class. dont pass up the opportunity to take this class that could be extremely dry and have it actually be fun!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2010<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Big D is the definition of &quot;THE MAN&quot; or &quot;BMOC&quot;.  He comes off as a strict hard nosed kinda guy but is very intelligent and very funny.  He makes class fun and is very personable with students in and out of class. He is tough on you in class and plays mind games on questions but it all ends up helping you in the end. Great teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: BLW301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Devience is touch but he's a great teacher. He knows his stuff and he teaches in a way thats easy to understand and he's also really funny. Although he can be intimidating you will get rewarded for participating in class, even if you're wrong. The class is 50% final 50% midterm but if you take good notes you'll be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>absolutely love the man! his jokes are hilarious & definitely make you remember the concepts better. participation is kind of a big deal. 50 midterm 50 final; but don't let that bother you too much. just put effort in and you'll be rewarded.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great teacher.  He taught everything in a way people understood, and always answered questions even if they took up the entire class.  I failed this class with another prof, and got an A with him.  Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, I'd agree with the two comments below as I had him the same quarter.  Speaking up in class is wise, but really should be done in any DePaul class when your paying $25,000 in tuition.  Do the homework, take GOOD notes in class, and attend review session (even if you have to miss class, as I did).  Do that should help you to earn an &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Think before you speak when answering a question or makinga comment. If you make a dumb point Devience will grill you much to the enjoyment of the class. Awesome teacher just go to his office and talk to him about anything. Do the problems and understand them. Best teacher at DePaul hands down. Really nice too once you get to know him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Devience is hilarious and makes the hour and a half pass quickly.  If you participate in class you can get points which will boost your grade and do the briefs/problems to guarantee you a decent grade.  He is not easy but go to his study sessions and memorize things that he points out in specific.  It should not be too difficult to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2009<br>Class Name: BUSLW102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Devience made me want to go into business law.

He is just incredible to listen to. He has so much knowledge and experience in this field. He makes you want to be a lawyer.  The class itself can be challenging. You really need to read, study, and participate in class. But an A is definitely attainable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2008<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love him.

It is a hard topic, but Devince makes it easy. He is very funny and he gives you examples you could never forget. the midterm and final make up your grade, but he goes over everything on them five times in class.

He seems like he hates everthing and everyone, but it is his lawyer side.  My advice to you is to read the chapters and come to class prepared for the questions.  Answer questions even though you might not be correct.  I got an &quot;A&quot; because I talked in class and answered questions.  I prbably deserved a &quot;B&quot;.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2005<br>Class Name: LAW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher and hope he is going to teach again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: 5<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2005<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the best teacher I've ever had at DePaul.  Just get on his good side, and back up your comments with good reasoning from the book (which you should read and read well). If you can back up what you say, you're golden. Smart, sarcastic, hilarious, really can't say enough good things about him.  I hope he didn't leave after Spring Quarter '05.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2005<br>Class Name: BLW142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an excellent professor.
