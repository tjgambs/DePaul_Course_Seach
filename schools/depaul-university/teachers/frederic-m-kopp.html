The class was a great topic and was taught very well. The professor knows the material and can talk about it a lot. The assignments and tests were fair and prepares you to get an A. There are no reasons to not get an A. Enjoyed the class and you should take this professor. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2015<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor and funny guy BUT : Midterm and final 100% written, gives you 25 terms that you must know 8-10 things about each, you get to pick 8 out of five on the exam day, plus 1 of  4-5 BROAD ESSAY TOPICS, so you basically have to memorize everything. If you can do that go for it because he's cool but studying for those exams was awful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2013<br>Class Name: HST172<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most interesting class I ever had! Professor provides the material in a very engaging way. The grade consists of two exams (study topics are given in advance); two simple quizzes; research paper; and optional extra credit for presentation. The attendance is not mandatory, but participation is graded. Take the class, you will really enjoy it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2012<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was a pretty good professor. He made history interesting, and he definitely knew his material. He was pretty laid back, attendance was mandatory at first but he never kept track. A Quiz, Midterm, Final, and Final Paper. He gives review sheets and has review days. Hardly read the book after the third week, additional readings are definitely optional</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2011<br>Class Name: HST173<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>read the novels he assigns, pay attention to his PP lectures. he GIVES u his class notes so just read them before the quizes (2, but he drops the lower one) and midterm and final (each are the same format with one essayquestion and 8 historical terms that u have to have a list of terms about) EASY A. german accent makes class funny</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: HST173<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT TEACHER!! Two quizzes. He drops the lower of the two.  One research paper.  Midterm. Final.  Gives two study guides long before the quizzes/midterm/final. He is extremely knowledgeable! He loves his subject and knows it like the back of his hand. I highly recommend him. Would definitely take him again if I could. Definitely participate!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: HST112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't you hate BS reviews&#63; Wanna know if this class is an easy A or not&#63; Here's the review: 1 Midterm + 1 Final (Both exact same format: 5 terms that need 10 facts each, and 1 essay) and a final 6 page paper. Review has 20-25 terms, only 8 will be on test - only need to choose 5. 4 essay &#63;'s on review, only 2 on test, need to pick only 1. [EASY B]</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2010<br>Class Name: HST112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think the rating on 4/1/09 is semi-misleading. Participation is a big part of this class because the grade is worth 20% out of whole. I can't say how lenient he is about that, but he did say on day one that just showing up doesn't get you the full points and that you need to raise hand and answer couple or more times. But the class is easy though</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2009<br>Class Name: HST171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, knows alot.

If you don't like history, he is a good teacher to have. He is helpful to students and extremely nice. There is just a midterm, a final, and a final paper (which you get to pick what to write about). If you're not big on participating than take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: HIS256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>just show up to class and pay attention. just one test, one paper and the final. two quizes but he drop the lowest grades.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2007<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great speaker. Textbook was a total waste of money, the lecture notes he posts online are 100% of what you need to study for midterm and finals. 6-8 page research paper. He lets you know exactly what questions will be on midterm and finals, what more do you want&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2007<br>Class Name: HST218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was cool. He lectured everyday though...but there was a lot of material to cover. I never read the book because the quizes are mostly off of notes and the mid term and final is just listing facts about 8 terms. Plus the paper is on whatever topic you want to write it on. Easy class, def. recommend</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2007<br>Class Name: HST218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Kopp made me want to learn and take up my history minor. Maybe it was the subject or it was the way he taught it but i am in love with the material. only midterm, final, and one paper. come to class every day and take some notes ull be good. dont even need to read. gives total study sheet for mt and final. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TEACHER!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2007<br>Class Name: HST218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool guy.  Liked the way he teached.  Not a hard class at all.  I didn't even read the book and I ended up with a solid B.  He gives review sheet for midterm and final and you have 2 quizzes; he drops the lowest one.  Also a 6 page paper.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: HSTSECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic teacher!  He was very helpful, graded fairly, and didn't take lack of attendance to heart.  Always available to answer questions after class.  Gives out a study guide for both MT/Final and all questions are just identification: you write what you remember.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: HST219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kopp is a good teacher. He mainly leactures. The student can earn extra credit by doing a short presentation which he gives you the info on. The studyguides are very detailed and very helpful. Overall easy A, and very easy B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2006<br>Class Name: HST218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not very interesting, but he doesn't grade hard.

He barely referenced the book and I barely even opened it and I still managed to pull of an A+ on the mid-term and final.  He's a little disorganized, but he's a good teacher.  Highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2005<br>Class Name: HST210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice man and a fairly good teacher. Gives study guides before the midterm and final- they are essay tests, so no tricks here. There is also a 6-9pg paper on the topic of your choosing. Don't bother to buy the book (I just barely opened it), you can get all the info you need online.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2005<br>Class Name: HIST<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's awesome... if you could take history from the clash, this is your dude.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2005<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Prof. Kopp!  I took him for a night class, and he made the time fly by.  Very knowledgable in what he's teaching.  Down to earth.  No homework.  Essay exams.  Didn't even by the book.  Got a solid B.
