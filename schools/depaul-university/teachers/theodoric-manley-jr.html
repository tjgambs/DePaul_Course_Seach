Dr. Manley is not an easy professor, but if you work hard and really try to understand what he wants you to get out of it it may be the best class you ever take.  I left Chicago shortly after this class, but it will always be something that helped shape who I became.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: CORE2676<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worrssttt communicator ever.

His lectures involve 2 hrs of verbal diarrhea that leaves everyone confused. Very inarticulate. Expectations on the assignments are not at all clear. Doesn't answer questions clearly, sometimes refuses to. Some of his opinions are out of date and he discourages debates</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: FSEM1234<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>keep talking about his own views. too strict on grading. i learned nothing from this course.

Speaking of papers, you have to write a lot in this class!!  There is also a lot of reading, and you have to reflect on the reading in journals so it is pretty mandatory.  He is an interesting guy, but expects a lot out of students and you'll pay for it if you don't keep up.  The class is very interesting though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class: &quot;White racism&quot; . EXCELENT teacher! I truly recomend him. He is very nice, but a little hard with grades. He is gonna shake your head and make you think. The subject is very interesting; it can even make you cry when u realize about things u didn't know. It will open your mind!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2006<br>Class Name: SOC347<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took SOC347 & SOC230. First off, SOC347 sucked. Narrow view, doesn't teach, full of his own studies/research. If you do the independent project you can bypass all the reading/hw (6 books) and get an A if you write a 15-20 pg paper on anything u want. SOC230 was awesome! Easy A - don't have to do the readings at all. DON'T BUY BOOKS - save ur $$</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2006<br>Class Name: SOPHSEMINAR<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: SOC230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was his first time teaching this class. So it was kind of akward at times. In the final project, he didn't really tell you what he was expecting. This make the field work research difficult. But he was easy to get a hold of.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: BLACKMETRO<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The assignments aren't hard just v. time consuming, lots of reading. No discusions which is a shame, v. boring. loved the class but didn't care for him, he didnt treat some people in the field too well.  Readings are great and I learned a lot. don't take if you expect it to be easy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2006<br>Class Name: GRADUATESOC<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't believe some of the wimps that call themselves college students at DePaul.I had Dr. Manley in grad school and thought he was one of the best professors I had. Yea, he makes you work, so what&#63; Grow up, these comments of Dr.Manley make me wonder who DePaul is letting into the university, because I don't want my degree to become &quot;de-valued&quot; by</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: HST290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was great!

His assignments are stupid, his midterm impossible, and his lectures are soo boring and confusing. He hates anyone that doesn't read the four stupid books and he makes no effort to help. There are no class discussions, only lectures. he was so bad I filed a complaint.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: BLACKMETRO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

He's kind of an **** though. He is quite pretentious, which can make it hard to get into the actual material.

Full of himself, self-rightous and all that, but really sit down and talk to him.  He has a great mind and if you are persistant he is willing to question all of his rigid ideas.  You will see he is really more of a challenging personality than a hot head.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2005<br>Class Name: SOC390<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: SOC465<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think he is an excellent teacher.

Eye opening.  Great professor. Definitely not an objective class to take; he is teaching it to get a point across.  It was designed like a grad school course, hard work, lots of reading and writing that I was not prepared for, but worth the time and the awareness.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sensitive material that he teaches well.  He has an agenda in his teaching, but it's a good one.  Lots of reading, but overall an easy class.  He appreciates genuine reflection, and proof that something has been learned and gained.  I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was very interesting, but the professor wasn't very clear about what he wanted.
