	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

Micro is not an easy subject, but the fact that he teaches it, makes it a lot easier. You are allowed one formula sheet on each exam. 3 exams, 6 home works, rare MC and a regression project.

Tons of real world experience.  He really can back up his talk because he has walked the walk for many years.  It can be a challenging class, but most Econ classes are.

Just accept that slides for most classes will have errors. He is quite knowledgeable, but not effective in transfering/sharing that info.

If it's been a while since you did math, review the business calculus book before the first class.  Material updated on Blackboard the day before or the day of class - no time to pre-review.

He can't present worth a damn, and his entire course is based out of this presentation notes.  Don't bother wasting your money on the textbook.
