She gives alot of feedback, but the amount she gives creates a cloud of confusion. By far the hardest grading class I have ever taken as two credits, and I am getting my Masters. She is a good person, not a good teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2015<br>Class Name: ONLINE<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>way to much work for a 2 credit online class.

It was an insane amount of work for a two credit online course. I honestly should have reviewed the syllabus more closely when I had the chance to switch to another class. She takes it a little too seriously and picks apart everything. She's nice, but I absolutely hated this class. Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2014<br>Class Name: AI115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class over winter break and was so glad I did. Jill was incredibly nice and funny and the class consisted of only a couple short papers (400 word count) and daily discussion posts. The only thing I was marked down on was the discussion posts because you have to post a LOT. Anyone who needs a quick two credits should take this class.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
