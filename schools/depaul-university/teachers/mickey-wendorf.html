	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

There seems to be a disconnect in the class however.  I don't find her lectures to be very clear and struggle because of it.

Her class consists of Power Points for each Chapter.. and these power points are such BS.. they don't even highlight the main points of the chapter!

I had Murphy for acc 101 and she was harder. Wendorf at least goes through the homework and she puts notes up on blackboard. Accounting is a hard subject and it is difficult to grasp, if you are failing or doing bad maybe it accounting is not your thing and most of the teachers are not easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE. She is very obnoxious.  Makes things that are quite simple ideas (once I learned them on my own from the book) very unclear and hard to understand.  Her quizes are like riddles.  She never has any answers for you when you ask a question, just leaves you more confused.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of the ten hardest courses according to DePaul.

She is the worst teacher EVER. Don't let her niceness fool you. She is extremely disorganized, unprepared for class, and tells the corniest jokes. She would post quizzes 2 weeks after we discussed them. Her PowerPoint slides were not up to date. Random multiple choice questions.

She cares about how things are going and is always helpful as long as she knows you're trying.
