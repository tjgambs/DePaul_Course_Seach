She offers a perspective completely different from what many others could offer. She is interesting to listen to and the material is fascinating. The class is definitely best when people have read and participate because she loves discussion. She is a relatively easy grader as long as she can tell you read.

The books were excellent with an interesting take on religious violence. She's super knowledgeable, funny, cute and very engaging. Discussion is encouraged and interesting. No tests, just papers, generally 5-page max.

Yes there is alot of reading but all of it was interesting and you discuss it each class so everything is understood.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: REL278<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're taking her class to fulfill a gen ed, GET OUT!  There are easier gen eds than hers.  There is a lot of reading .  Some of it is interesting.  The class is based on 3 papers and 10% attendance.  She wants everyone to learn, but if you don't like the subject, don't take the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She isn't easy, gives you a huge amount of reading and some of it is hard to digest. But she tells you this up front, she is crystal clear on all everything and is a very talented teacher. She can be surprisingly funny at times and her knowledge about the subject was incredible. She is still figuring out her teaching still, will be great someday</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2008<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very knowledgeable, and the grade was based entirely on 3 different papers.  I really enjoyed this class, though. It was very interesting, and I highly recommend this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2006<br>Class Name: PAX200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really disliked her. Aside from her frigid personality, she required ridiculous mandatory trips with a peace/religious organization (30hrs! ), grades oddly and inconsistently. She made interesting material uninteresting. If you have other options take them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2006<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor, great class!

Take good notes, they're all you need for the exams and papers!  You don't really have to do the reading, just go to class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2005<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the kind of professor that simply expects you to get involved in the class...is that so much to ask for&#63;  Write a few papers, take no tests, and get involved in class discussions.  I like her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2005<br>Class Name: REL142<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great class. great teacher, very hard, doesn't take any crap</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2005<br>Class Name: REL142<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2005<br>Class Name: REL242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's super serious, so be ready to work. If you're a good writer, you'll do fine. Powerpoints are posted on blackboard. Interesting reading. Participate in class so she gets to know who you are. Beware of group project.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2005<br>Class Name: REL263<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took &quot;Religion and Political Conflict in South Asia.&quot; One of the strongest and most fascinating courses I've taken at DePaul. Amazing readings. Excellent balance of lecture and discussion. Knows how to keep conversation on track while synthesizing even the most inane comments. This course ignited my ongoing obsession w/ the Hindu Right.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: HINDUTHOUGH<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have no idea on Hinduism, then don't take her. Only take her if you have a good idea on Hinduism. For example, Brahim&#63; Atman&#63; if you have no idea what that means, then don't take her. Only take her if you know a good amount of hinduism. Very tough grader, went to the writing center and still got B's on my paper. &quot;I don't give A's&quot; (Menon)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: REL242<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes strict on attendance.  Shes really not that hard, her tests are very straightfoward, generally vocab identification and 2 essays which she tells you will be on there.  Papers are a little harder she doesnt really say what she wants clearly.  She is safe to take to fit your schedule or if no one else is available.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2005<br>Class Name: REL242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard teacher, she expects you to know every single detail and grades very hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2005<br>Class Name: REL242<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is 100% unbiased. I did not like, however, that she was able to take a subject as interesting as Hinduism and make it dry & boring (especially surprising b/c she is a Hindu herself). I felt she could have offered more personal accounts, or more of a Hindu perspective. She grades pretty tough on papers (B-) but received A's on the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I ignored the mediocre rating for this prof and took her anyway.  MISTAKE.  I did the readings, carefully wrote pretty good essays, and went to all classes but one.  Barely got a B-.  Unless you're perfect, don't expect an A, or even an A-.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2005<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>find a better class for your money. Getting an A is almost impossible. No tests,tho. u'll do well in the class if ure really interested or if youre already educated on the subject. If not, good luck. She doesnt engage the student enough, can be rude. Very tough grader. Take an easier rel req.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2005<br>Class Name: HINDU<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Menon gave me a good grade and didn't work me too hard.

I thought her lectures were boring and her way of teaching was awful.  I dreaded going to this class, she did not entertain or grab my attetion in any way.  Her papers seemed to be easy until you get it back and she did not like anything you wrote.  Don't take!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2005<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher. Her lectures are very in-depth, intelligent and she gives a multi-faceted view of the conflicts involved. Don't know where people got that she is trying to get you to &quot;buy&quot; Hinduism, b/c in this class she's v. unbiased. Her accent is fine. Learned a lot and loved it.

Three papers and no mid-term or final. The paper topics were a little unclear at first, but if you to go to her and ask her what she wants, she tells you pretty much what your paper should consist of. You don't have to take notes b/c there are no quizzes or tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2004<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has such a terrible accent, you simply can't understand her if you don't stand right next to her.
