All the readings in class were boring and irrelevant. It was really easy to fall asleep n his class because of his voice and material. Do not recomend taking him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class if you do the work and actually try. He grades participation, discussion, and attendance. But, he rarely leaves  time to participate. No textbook. Takes attendance. Is very hard to understand and hear when he talks. Makes things a lot more confusing than it really is. I am not sure he knows what he is trying to teach. Nice guy tho</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was his first time teaching the class so I'll cut him a lot of slack. He was really uptight in the beginning but got fun at the end. Grades tough on papers and quizzes but is willing to talk it out. And by that I mean give you extra points on them. Overall he was an alright teacher for the class. Didn't have to buy any books.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
