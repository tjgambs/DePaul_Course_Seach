DePaul just handed him the Head of the position because they did not feel like finding someone qualified and he was here. He can't direct, he can't write, and he doesn't even try to teach. He just hands out passing grades, that's the only reason people like him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2013<br>Class Name: DC398<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a fun professor, but is a bit pretentious as well.

He's hilarious, and the sweetest guy ever. He is so incredibly passionate you can't help but be affected by it. To a previous poster... so what if there are posters with is name on it... he STARTED the film program at DePaul and he is the HEAD of the program! He's amazing, I can't wait to take another class with him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2011<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very funny professor who knows what he's talking about and clearly has a passion for film.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2010<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what they negative comments are all about.

He expected masterpieces and great acting&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: DC270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Matt is absolutely hilarious.  His classes tend to be half blow-off and half really interesting. He wants his students to succeed and will trim down assignments/make them optional if things are getting too difficult.  He is truly a fan of film and seems to really enjoy teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2007<br>Class Name: CMN274<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Helpful.

His class goes by the syllabus and is very laid back about class. If all professors were like Matt, everyone would go to college. Keep it real, and do good work and you'll be rewarded for it, otherwise expect to get burned. Ask if he likes Sparklehorse.

You'll be well educated and entertained during lecture; he's very, very funny and handsome. On film critique days, he's completely unsparing with an unworthy product so plan to work.

I did see how he would kinda**** on other students who didnt share his tastes.Also, he did give off the vibe of the guy who didnt get laid in high school and being a prof is his big chance to redeem. This one gal rejected him and he stopped loving her videos.  Pretty lame.

Those that respond negatively are probably the ones that didn't care about the class to begin with.  And the sexual harrassment&#63;  Give me a break.  I'm a woman and I didn't for one minute feel that.  All I felt was Matt caring about this area and the students involved in it.

BUT he needs to figure out if he wants to be a teacher or a director.  He comes off as very charming but at the same time he is a little too opinionated for his repertoire.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2004<br>Class Name: DIRECTING<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes cool and funny.  Nice guy.  Good sense of humor.  Doesn't care how you get projects done as long as you get them done.  You should have some DC background before you enter the class.
