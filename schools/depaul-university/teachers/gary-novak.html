He's super funny and gives a ton of advice with writing and what not. Also really funny, and does not have much busy work. Probably one of the best DC teachers at the school, in my opinion. Also gives great feedback on scripts and has a lot of good examples to show in class. Overall awesome guy as well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class. While the lessons may not have been so captivating, the assignments (short film & music video) and field trips to Essanay & Big Shoulders Digital Video were a lot of fun to do. Terrific professor. Awesome common hour mentors as well. Definitely looking forward to taking his DC 222 class (Hollywood Film Structure).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty good guy, very energetic and well educated in the film business.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gary is an amazing teacher. He has influenced my life incredibly in just two classes and has always been supportive when I've come to him for outside help and advice about film. He's very much the brooding, angsty writer type but there's a lot of passion behind him, he's sarcastic and doesn't really take himself seriously, and he's so inspiring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting as a teacher, and very engaging.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: DC301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy - yes. Useful - no. Keep copies of your  work because he loses everything.  Feedback he gives on your homework is more about keeping you in his section of the school and filling classes than it is on anything else.   This whole thing seems like a joke compared to other film/writing schools. Sorry, but it is true. Save youself.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great, great, great teacher.  Take this class even if you have no interest in DC, because Gary makes the class fun.  He is SO laid back and likes to be called by Gary, and he doesn't care what he says, he says it like it is, and it's funny.  Doesn't assign too much homework either, and what he does assign is fairly simple.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the online version of this class and it was pretty easy. Listen to the lectures,follow the examples that he uploads, and do your homework and you should be fine. The only thing that could trip you up is the morning journal which can be a pain since you have to write two pages everyday for 5 or so weeks.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2009<br>Class Name: DC525<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a joke. This was a required course and a complete waste of actual class time.

If you have the chance to take a course with him DO IT. His knowledge about things is amazing and he really motivates you to be part of what he's teaching. Laid back, and has a great sense of humor. Attendance is not mandatory, but I enjoyed his class enough to make an effort to come, DO NOT PASS UP TAKING HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2008<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really fun and interesting class... learned how to make movies on iMovies.

I had him for both screenwriting and foundations of cinema. An extremely laid back and interesting professor. Despite being an easy A you still learn a ton about movies. Shows tons of clips from great movies. Definitely take Gary even if just for an Arts and Lit cred. Highly Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2007<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE BEST YOU CAN GET IN DEPAUL..

Informal in teaching style and works well. He's got great humor and his subjects are awesome. Spices everything up however he can and paper assignments are easy to complete. No attendance taken, but it's more than worth it to come to class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very laid back guy, fun attitude and atmosphere.
