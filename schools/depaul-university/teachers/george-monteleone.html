He's slightly disorganized. Two tests, both open note, can be a bit tricky, but if you actually went to class and paid attention, you'd do just fine. Two more papers that are a little vague but he was a generous grader. I was amazed to see I got a B+ when in reality I probably deserved a C at best.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2011<br>Class Name: DC228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class. Lays everything out to help understand difficult topics. 2 tests with notes sheets, fairly easy. 2 papers however a little more difficult. Overall good teacher, not a boring lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: ANI110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It surprised me to see how hipster this guy actually is (and I totally mean this in a good way.)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2010<br>Class Name: ANI105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring. lectures a lot and the quizzes have a lot of names and things to memorize. The text book was the most boring thing ever, he even admitted it. The only good thing was there was no exam for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: ANI105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's probably one of the coolest teachers at DePaul. He combines lessons with interesting pop culture references. Plus, he knows how to make people laugh. I'd take a class by him again. Also, his beard is just great.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/15/2010<br>Class Name: DC274<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Acknowledges when the material may be boring, but does his best to make it fun. Also had him for Ani 105. Both classes were equally enjoyable. Take his classes when you have the chance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2010<br>Class Name: DC233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SO CUTE.
