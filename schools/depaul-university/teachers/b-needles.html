Exams are difficult, but you do get a chance to earn some extra credit.  I had to teach myself throughout the course and ask other students for help.  Also the HPC report was very vague and he did not answer any questions on how to do it.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2015<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Needles is very passionate about accounting.  However, he does not do the best job of explaining problems to the class.  My biggest complaint is that most of the class is filled with full time students who are majoring in accounting.  Those of us in the part-time evening program have a tough time getting to the extra credit events.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: 372H<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really didn't find Needles to be as tough as everyone makes him seem. It's audit... of course the material will be difficult. However, I didn't find his tests any more difficult than other 300 level honors accounting classes. He sincerely cares about the success of his students. Although his lectures are brutally boring, he's a genuine man.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2014<br>Class Name: ACC372H<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not gonna lie, hardest class I've ever taken (and I took AP classes in high school). It's not the professor's fault; audit's just a lot of work. It isn't impossible tho. READ every chapter. Look over the multiple choice questions on d2l (I know it's alot but it's worth it). Take his 10 steps to auditing seriously. And PAY CLOSE ATTENTION in class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: ACC372H<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>It's a tough class, I mean its auditing. He really tries to teach you, kind of funny. He wants to help you and responds to emails quickly. The midterm and final are extremely difficult, but at this stage in the accounting curriculum, nothing is easy. If you study and ask questions you should do fine. Also extra credit opportunities. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2014<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Save your GPA.

You can go to class, read the book, and do all the homework and still do poorly because his tests are crazy hard. Don't listen to the people giving him good reviews. It's probably the professor himself.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2014<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most boring professors I've ever had. Takes very long pauses in his speeches and goes on boring tangents. You'll learn more reading the textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2014<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unless you're a genius, you won't do well in his class. If you pay attention in class and do well on the homework assignments you'll more than likely still end up with  a mediocre grade. His tests are some of the hardest I've ever taken. I know someone who aced all his accounting classes before this one.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2013<br>Class Name: ACC372H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Did not like him because I felt as if he was not good at teaching the information. The exams were not impossible but not easy either. You must study a lot for the exams. In the end, he was a fair grader</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: ACC372H<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Auditing is a hard class in general, but if you follow his 10 steps to acing audit you can get an A. Do the bonus paper, it will help boost your grade. Read the book, do the sample test questions from each chapter he posts on D2L, and review his slides before midterm and final. One of the harder ACC teachers, but very fair.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Needles is such a nice person and a great professor. The course is hard, but we're in a 300 level class that is expected. Read the chapters take the self-test questions online and try your best. He is aware his test are difficult, but they are not impossible.  Great professor and I would recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2012<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The prof's title (Professor CPA ...etc) might make you think that he is the ideal teacher. But you'd be wrong. I wish I read these comments before I took his class. It was a waste and didn't get anything from him. Basically, whatever I know about Financial accounting I know because of what I taught myself. you'd lose your money and time taking him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2012<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Needles definitely knows what he's talking about, but is unable to explain it to students. He also wrote the textbook so if you don't understand that- going to class won't help. Expect a lot of useless outside work. He doesn't even look at it and barely goes over it, and expect classes that jump all over the place and are completely rushed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2012<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He might know the subject, but his way of teaching is the worst in the world not just at Depaul. He doesn't explain anything, he will make you read the chapters and do the homeworks before the class, once in the class, he would go thru few exercises from the homework. I found his way a wast. if you take him, you would regret it. it's waste.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Needles knows this material inside out and expects you to do the same. However, he is always open to helping students out during his office hours.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is very hard. You HAVE to read the chapters and understand them. The midterm and final were basically very long CPA questions. It is interesting and he is a good teacher. It does require a lot of hours for homework and studying so make sure you can put in the hours, which is expected since it is a 300 level accouting class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a passion for accounting. He knows the subject forwards and backwards, and he keeps up-to-date with research.  However, his presentations are dull, and not very effective.  You also have to spend $200 on books that he wrote..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2010<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an expert in the field of accounting, so he is very comfortable with the material. I would not say that presenting material, however, is his forte. After ten weeks, I was happy to get through my first accounting course with a B. I would avoid him if I had to do it over again, but a lot of people prefer him. He was just a bit dull for me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2009<br>Class Name: ACC372H<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For the exams, you have to know your stuff.  There is much room for improvement, if you don't receive a *great* midterm score.  What you put in is what you'll get out.  I enjoyed this class and it is a unique ACC class because it is more theoretical and involves much more theory than problem solving.  Dr. Needles is a great professor, and I mean it</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2009<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers I've ever had.

He starts at the beginning so that even those students who have never taken accounting before can follow along. A lot of work, but the payoff is that you learn a lot as well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2008<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can tell Prof. Needles is well distinguished in his field and he makes sure you know it. However, this is beneficial to this class because he has a lot of stories pertaining to Acct. To study for tests, do the practice questions on BB.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2008<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took accounting before and I just found out that he teaches totally new accounting to me. He puts a lot of attention to remembering useless formulas instead of teaching what those numbers mean in real life.

He also uses technology(& his asst!) as a crutch to rarely actually grade anything - so what does he get paid for&#63; He knows his stuff though - so if you do have questions he is great with answering them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2008<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There was a lot to learn in this class, and the exams were challenging.  Most of the time I think he explained the concepts well, though he lost me a couple times. If you read the book, do the homework and the practice tests online you should do well. The scam with the book he wrote and the Eduspace (online) code is kind of annoying though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2008<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think Needles is a very good professor.

Needles goes off on random tangents about his influential friends all the time...best to bring a crossword/other homework.  Homework almost every night, but only 1-3 problems each time.  Luckily all the exam questions are straight off the practice quizes on blackboard.  Definitely sparked an interest in Auditing, but not the best teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is pretty hard and needs to have a good prof.  Unfortunately Needles is not the guy to teach it.  He gets off subject easily and loves to brag about who he knows.  He travels so there are days missed of class.  His tests are pretty hard..very hard.   If your not in strobel try to take someone else...if you are in strobel....good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: AUDIT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was dry, boring and useless. lots of rambling. the final was impossibly hard. don't take him unless you got no choice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2005<br>Class Name: AUDITING<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>damn....</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/15/2005<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grading is fair - very knowledgeable professor - tests are challenging if you have never had acounting - but finally a graduate level class that isn't a complete joke - welcomed change</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is extremely boring!
