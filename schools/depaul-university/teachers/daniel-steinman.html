This guy's lectures are dry and will literally put you to sleep. There is an assignment due EVERY CLASS covering vague and technical readings about recording. They are nothing but busy work. The labs are all right, but 6 is too many and I don't think he's reviewed his own lab instructions in years.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2007<br>Class Name: REC216<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, agreed.  I found that the class added to my understanding of the broad subject of recording.  This is not a course covering ProTools software alone.  When I took the course there were four labs.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2007<br>Class Name: REC216<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of busywork! Wasn't that effective teaching the material and was pretty unorganized. Really hated his class by the end of the year, but I'll cut him some slack because his wife had a baby in the middle of the quarter so that might have made things tough on him. Knows a lot about the subject but doesn't teach well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2006<br>Class Name: REC216<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, easy guy. Makes you do busy work in class, doesn't really teach about the subject itself. You only end up doing two labs, didn't really learn all that much.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
