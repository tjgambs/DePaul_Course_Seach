The material itself is boring and difficult to pay attention in class. it would be better if we did more practice problems.  he is a little vague about what he expects for each assignment, but this is more to the students benefit. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2013<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great professor. He's not boring at all and very straight forward. He has a great sense of humor and makes the class fun. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2010<br>Class Name: MGT315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Sharmanator! Wow... guy leaves me speechless. What a classy guy, laid back teacher, and loyal friend. I don't care the position, I would vote this Hero in.

No HW, quizzes, or attendance.  Just 2 tests and a paper.  Easiest grader ever.  Bring your laptop to class and sit in the back.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a cool guy, really. The class is just a midterm, final, attendance, and group paper. The midterm and final was confusing because it wasn't what was covered in class but if you just read the book and you'll do fine. The class lecture isn't too helpful though, he sort of reads off the powerpoint...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor! Really intelligent and you can learn a lot form him. The subject is kind of dry, but he makes it interesting with real world examples. midterm, group project and final! Huge curve on tests! gives extra points for attendance :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Totally chill and very helpful.

It was an hour and a half, but we only stayed for an hour and most days he was 10 minutes late.  It was fairly easy as long as you read.  the midterm was open book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2007<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a completely laid back prof. The class is VERY EASY. A freshman knowing nothing about psychology can ace it. Prof. Sharma is extremely helpful  and will go the extra mile to help you understand the topics. Its was a fun class to say the least.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was extremely easy.
