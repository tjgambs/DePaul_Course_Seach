However, be prepared for her to talk the entire lecture. Lots of reading required. It's difficult to understand her, but if you ask her to explain further she would be happy to do so. No tests, just 3 papers and some reading assignments. Make sure you go, she takes attendance every class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2012<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class does require quite a lot of work from you but she is extremely helpful. Always available during her office hours and more than willing to break things down and work with you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2011<br>Class Name: SOC402<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a little hard to understand but if you go to her office she will do what she can to help you out. I used the internet to help me understand some of the topics and once I understood them her lectures were much easier to follow. It is easy to get a little lost as she teaches ahead and then backtracks.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2009<br>Class Name: SOC279<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does not present material in a way that is understandable. I found this class very unhelpful in my study of sociology.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2009<br>Class Name: SOCI412<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just want to say that it makes no sense to me to rate professors on their ability to teach because professors are not trained in teaching. Rather, they are trained in Ph.D. programs to conduct scholarly research. That is, they are trained to be scientist which is something vastly different from a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: SOCMETH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Since you need to take research methods, take them with her. She is very open to suggestions and listens to her students. She's cool; the workload was reasonable. In 380, there was a midterm she basically goes over with you and a final paper. In 381, there were 4 papers. Put in some effort and you can easily get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: SOC411<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Garner is very helpful if you meet with her outside of class; the library catalog in her head is ridiculous. She is a bit too focused on the &quot;classical&quot; theorists for my tastes, but to each their own. Regarding the course: could only miss 1/2 class before it affects the grade, but she seemed to relax on this a bit.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: SOC279<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This Professor is horrific. She cannot teach to save her life, could not possibly be LESS HELPFUL inside and outside of the classroom, her tests are written horribly and do not reflect class material whatsoever.  The only thing worse than her teaching is the book we used...which WAIT, was written by her. Avoid Garner like the plague.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: SOC379<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was an excellent teacher when it came to stats.  She explained everything so well and never gives up on a student.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2005<br>Class Name: STATS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Garner is one of the greatest teachers I have ever had. I have taken easier math classes and have done worse then in Statistics. She is very helpful and makes class the best it can be, especially for a statistics class. I have actually learned fromer her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: STATS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is hell bur stats suck to begin w.  Really hard to follow and understand.  If you show her you care by going to see her at her office hours she'll give you a pitty grade of a &quot;c&quot; which allows you to take the next course required research method I.  Funny and sweet try her out.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2004<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>loved this lady</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: SOC331379<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Garner is fabulous - she's not too difficult but not terribly easy...and though she'll make you read her book, she's not arrogant about it. She actually made Stats kind of fun, though I still despise the subject. Very nice to talk to outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2004<br>Class Name: SOCIOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best and most influential teacher i have ever had at depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2003<br>Class Name: SOC379<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Explains things a million times until the students finally understand it-- she won't give up on anyone.
