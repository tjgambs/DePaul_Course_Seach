I just took her for winter intercession and couldn't be happier. On our last day of class, we had a pizza party (which she bought for everyone) with review bingo and prizes. She means well and is warm hearted. She is always trying to help with career advice also. Show up to class and participate and it's a very easy course. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>She offers the option to do community service instead of 3,000 word paper. I think at her core she is a nice lady, but honestly but can be rude. She grades the homework much harder than she should. Will call on you at randomly. No quizzes or tests. Exams online (the q&a can all be found easily on google) Don't need the book or to show up in class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2014<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took the 5-week summer course.  Most of the learning was done outside the classroom.  The mid-term and final were pretty easy, the MC portion was 60 points with a 10-point curve.  The case studies aren't too bad as long as you put some original thought into them.  Should get an A as long as you put in the time and effort.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2014<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class online. Gives you tons of material/tasks for each section, most of which is irrelevant. She doesn't really clarify what is expected of you so her grading is tough until you figure it out. Grades based on her required "word count" threshold. Buy the online book so you can search for answers to the exams easily.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was the worst class experience in my entire student life!!! She thinks this is the only class we are taking and requires time consuming tasks!! Very tough grader on everything! The class is so boring and if you ask/answer a question she makes you feel like you are stupid. Just avoid her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2014<br>Class Name: MGT529<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take any courses with this professor. She has bad grammar, explains things poorly, and her assignments are long, cumbersome and redundant. For example, she will ask you to 'tab' a document, when she really means that you should create a heading. She is also very biased against international students, especially from China.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2011<br>Class Name: MKTG555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was interesting on a few points. Very high level recap of HR. Cases were straight forward. Grading was easy. Midterm and Final were hard as they were online. Create an outline of the topics and pg numbers to help during the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2011<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wastes ALOT of class time handing back papers & doing admin stuff that could be done online.Online exams test speed rather than knowledge.They are HARD but curved to be fair after.The one great thing about class is that she forces you to network with classmates and offers detailed & practical resume tips.Bearable only b/c of the networking & tips.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2010<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>took her for dec. session. attendance counts...you have to stay the WHOLE time cause she will go through it before end of class. i didn't use the book just use the notes...either way midterm and final are hard. 60 multi choice and 5 essays through D2L timed! the journal is truly a waste of time as are the cases. boring!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2010<br>Class Name: MGMT307<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is terrific. She is very knowledgeable about the topic and very willing to help. Also a very nice and sweet person. The book is necessary, but easy to read. Great intro to human resource management.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2010<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I personally would not take her again. The material seems to be simple so far, but her &quot;opinions&quot; and &quot;assumptions&quot; about minorities are very biased and offensive. She made certain students feel very uncomfortable when it came to race, nationality, ethnicity, etc. She says what she wants and doesn't care who likes it. I would never take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2010<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is biased and sticks to her own opinion even though she doesn't have anything to back up her points or valid experience. She brags about how amazing she is. She talks slow and will mark you late for attendance! She is strictly by the book and is stuck in her own bubble. Doesn't seem very willing to compromise and is a tough paper grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2010<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Poor Quality. Doesn't actually lecture much. Students do presentations, sticks you in group to discuss cases that have little to do with reading. Grading unfair. No understanding of the real world. MT/Final Hard, but curved. Overly Critical and pompous. If you can take someone else... do so.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does not go over any slides in class.  A LOT of reading and 3 case study assignments with too much required writing for answers to case study (min. 2500 words/ case).  Online midterm and final difficult, but she curves generously.  Not a hard class, just a lot of reading and busy work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2010<br>Class Name: MGMT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst class. Dr. Lavan is an awful teacher who does not even teach. I took the blended (1/2 online) class. What a waste of time going to class was. She assigns a ton of work too. She is very opinionated and does not take feedback well. STAY AWAY!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2010<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for December Intersession class and she wasnt too bad.  The whole class consted of group work, and online midterm and final.  Also if you didnt want to take the online exam she lets you take a paper exam.  Stict attendance but shes nice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: MGT305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My instructor in 1973.Outspoken then as the only woman instructer in the school of business.BUT, she was the only college teacher I ever had that took the seniors on a field trip, to an employment agency.She did more than play the classroom game. She cared about her students.Hopefully, inspite of the character attacks here, still does!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is nice but too boring. She expects you to know so many concepts. We had to do journals of everything we went through in class and didnt give us the time to work on them. Even though the midterm and final were on Blackboard, the exam was timed and the questions were very hard. You really need to know the concepts in the text book very well</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RUN AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS WOMAN AS YOU CAN. She's absolutely terrible! She doesnt understand the world of HR, has NEVER worked a day in her life for a company, teaches based on her own theories rather than first hand, practical application. VERY opinionated and refuses to entertain anything but her own views. Spend your tuition $$ elsewhere!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2009<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT WATE YOUR TIME IF YOU DONT HAVE TO... she is the worst ever.. she gave us a test online with open books, yet balme us of cheating... you can copy from the internet from the book from your note but you cant get help from a preson sitting next to you. she blame the all class for it can it be more crazy then that dont waset your energy in her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2008<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lavan has her opinions, and you have to agree with her to get the grade you want. She discusses peoples grades in front of the whole class. Tells you how your career path is all WRONG and then expects a complement. You learn how to argue better in her class. Online Mid Term and Final, no hw.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2008<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible teacher doesn't know how to teach give an online test but doesn't consider software problem. she is ignorant and if you have a different point of view she would not like you. doesn't have any respect to people and everything you say is wrong.. since we start the class we didn't study anything helpful. AVOID TAKING HER IF YOU DON'T HAVE 2</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2008<br>Class Name: MGMT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lavan reads straight from powerpoint notes. If attendance was not taken, lectures would be useless. Workload is okay, but in the summer it is incredible! Easy grader, but it is hard to get her to tell you what she wants. Terrible feedback on assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest A I have received.

Crazy grader, has no idea what she wants. Holds &quot;conferences&quot; with students in front of the whole class for all to hear. If she picks you to be on her good side you'll get A's for the quarter. Otherwise you're screwed. Avoid her!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2007<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady but a little strange.

I have to be honest, she is a fair grader, BUT no benefit from her classes at all. Be ready to work your ass off, but learn nothing!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2007<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While she may not be the best lecturer, she is very responsive to inquiries on a variety of topics. She has lots of experience and has proven to be a great resource for any questions regarding job hunting and HR policies. Plus, she treated us to delicious deep dish pizza on the last day of class. Very generous!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2007<br>Class Name: MGMT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is completely useless.  Midterm and Final are brutal.  She pulls out useless pieces of information that are relevalant only to ensure you read every line in the text.  She assigns a huge paper at the end of the class and I know for sure she doesnt read it.  Just concentrate on the summary.  She is rude and very condescending stay away.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2007<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is Brutal! She doesn't teach anything. You have 7 quizes(40%). She does drop 2 but some of them are on 5 chapters, and only have 15 minutes to take it. Also, the questions are really specific. There is a paper, that is a &quot;best practice&quot; paper (50%) and 10% for going to class. She is awful!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2007<br>Class Name: MGT529<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Try to avoid taking her.  She is very condescending and always offers her blunt and sometimes rude opinion on everything!  It's her way or the highway!  She is very knowledgeable because she is a career advisor, but it does not compensate for her poor attitude.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2007<br>Class Name: MGT529<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>powerpoint slides are outrageous - my little brother could make them more applealing. lectures on and on about common knowledge - probably the worst class of my grad career so far. it's only 4 classes and she teaches two, but seriously, unless you really want to change careers (portfolio project is decent), avoid this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/24/2006<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the worst professor at DePaul and possibly any school.  This is the worst experience I have had in the MBA program.  She needs to retire and stop ruining the learning experience for everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2005<br>Class Name: MGT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>get on her good side, your in good shape, other wise, im sorry.

Easy class though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2005<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is horrible!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I've ever had at any level.  Her lectures are useless.  Her final exam covered nit-picky BS that had nothing to do with the material.  Her discussions are very one-sided as she is intolerant of any view point that isn't her own.  Her class was a miserable experience.  Avoid Prof. LaVan at all costs!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2005<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The lectures were meaningless and unstructured.  The course materials were asssembled by the professor with minimal effort.  If you have to take this class take it from any other professor possible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2005<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most useless lectures I have ever been to....</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: MGT361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is very boring.  Homework assignments are incredibly easy.  The midterm is easy too.  The final paper is 15 pages, but she is not that strict with it.  Mine was only about 11 pages of real writing and I still got an A-.  Take this class if you want a good grade, but prepared to be bored.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: MGT361<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the worst professors I've ever had. There is no focus or purpose to her course, very unorganized - just visit her office. Power point presentations are BORING, and she is a terrible speaker, gets distracted, etc. then is extremely fickle when critiquing others. Who knows what her logic is when it comes to grading&#63;She just plain sucks!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: MGT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is boring, bring lots of coffee otherwise you are going to go to sleep. Do not take her. Tests are hard, and not an easy grader when it comes down to papers. Do not make the same mistake i made, do not take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2005<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely nice lady. Her tests are directly off of her powerpoint slides, so make sure to study those decently & youll be fine. The only bad thing is the long paper at the end, do not procrastinate on it and the class will be a very pleasant experience.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She definitely has real world experiance, and knows what she is talking about, but teaching class through 40 slides of power point is a killer.  There is a midterm and final that are so-so, and a HUGE final paper.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is quite easy, the teacher however is just alright.  Slide shows each day have roughly 40 slides just to ensure that you wont keep paying attention.  Tests are very easy, would recommend class to anyone that just needs to get a class out of the way.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2004<br>Class Name: MGMT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will learn a lot from classroom discussion - teacher is very interactive with the students.  Midterm and Exams are very difficult, but there is a curve.  I learned a lot from this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2004<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. LeVan needs to spend some time in the real world. Her acedemic advice to students on career changes and approach to career change is grounded in the hot employement market of the 1990s. Some of her opinions are dangerous to careers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2004<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her the summer of 2004 and her classes are not boring, but her exams are the hardest I have ever taken and are based almost all out of the book.  She gives you extra credit on the exams, but there are very few &quot;A&quot;s given out.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2004<br>Class Name: MGTN307<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talks a lot about**** you won't care about.
