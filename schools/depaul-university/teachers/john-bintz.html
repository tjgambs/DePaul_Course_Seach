Bintz went over powerpoints that he posted on D2L. Welcomed in class discussion. No homework given, just a solo project and small group project. As mentioned, do write down the little odd stuff he says as it can be on his tests. Would certainly recommend him, great instructor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Suuuper easy class. He flies through the lectures, but everything is online, so it doesn't matter. Write down the random things he says during class instead of lecture notes, those will be on quiz and you can look at lecture notes online anyway. Really nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super easy class.

He is much more concerned with the students actually learning something useful than straight memorization of abstract ideas. He has real life experience to share and brings in many guest lecturers to share their thoughts and ideas. This was one of the most enjoyable classes I had. When you enjoy the class, you always pick up more.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Bintz was great!

Teaches from powerpoint slides, but supplements them with his own wisdom. No book required. He brought in guest speakers, which supplemented the teachings. Tests were straightforward. His simplistic teaching style enabled me to learn a lot from the class. He's my favorite professor from college. Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2012<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor and guy. Not an academic, but you learn lots of real world material in his class.  Exams of from powerpoint slides.  He doesn't make you buy a book.  YOU MUST STUDY THE POWERPOINT SLIDES.

I took this class during winter intersession as a night class he let us out early every day. Don't buy the book. He covers everything in his lectures through powerpoint slides.

I took him during intercession and never used the book. Everything he says is what is on his exams and the assignments are a breeze all you have to do is put forth SOME effort.
