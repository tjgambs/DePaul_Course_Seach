			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

If you actually want to learn something, I recommend taking her. It's a difficult class, but she really tries to make it not so bad. We had many online quizzes, take-home stuff, but the midterm and final were really difficult-As long as you print her class notes and study thoroughly you'll be fine</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lueders is the best professor I've had. she explains everything and make sure everything is clear. she gives out take home quizzes that are not hard. online quizzes are once a week but you get two chances to take it. She really cares for her students and tries to benefit them as much as possible. Take her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2014<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady and very helpful. However, it was not an easy class be ready to study Governmental acc (that she says is not a big part of the test)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2014<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If DePaul had a few more good professors like Lueders, then maybe it would be worth the tuition. She honestly taught the class very well, class time passes fast which is  very unusual for any class, especially accounting. She teaches everything that is on the exam and tells you exactly what u need to know. Most students did surprisingly well!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was by far the BEST professor in all of accounting.  Clearly, I thought so because I took her for both 102 & 308.  I HIGHLY recommend her.  Accounting is a difficult subject so none of the professors are going to be really easy, but not only does she make great & organized lecture notes but the tests are not too bad either if you study well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lueders is a very nice lady. She honestly gave off the feel like she could be an intelligent aunt. Introductory accounting classes are difficult by nature. If you're looking for a blow off teacher in accounting you're not going to find one but Professor Lueders is the next best thing. She is so entirely organized and the workload was consistent.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She can come off kind of strict, but the hour-and-a-half goes by like a breeze. If you're not a bum, I would suggest taking her, as she expects a decent amount from you. You WILL learn. I would take her again, too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is very helpful in class and office hours just ask for help! she is straight forward with her requirements. she DOES NOT curve final grades so try hard. If something is unclear just ask and she'll explain it again. If you have another professor, drop them and take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall Luders is a good teacher, she cares about you knowing the "big picture" as well as the working parts. I think she is a giving grader if you do the work. I think the key here is to STUDY! I would take her again but this time I would  study more.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very sharp and experienced, probably won't find a smarter accounting professor. It was difficult to keep up with her during class, I had to hire a tutor to reteach me. You really need to work hard in her class or you will fail the exams. Take only if you grasp accounting well. Nice lady though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was really bad at Accounting 101 and was terrified of having to take another class after a summer has past. Prof Lueders completely changed my mind. She is a great teacher that explains everything in clear detail and is very helpful if there is something unclear. Definitely would suggest her, she really does care about the students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hated accounting after 101. Still hate it. So from someone who hates accounting, I highly recommend taking this professor. She makes the subject as clear as possible. Class is midterm, final, and 6 take home quizzes. Midterm and final are straight off the quizzes and she gives a detailed study guide. So study and an A is a real possibility.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Weekly Quizzes. I liked them b/c they kept me on track. Looking back the Midterm and Final, they were very fair. She gives you a study guide that covers it and sometimes hints off a question or two. Sounded easier than Towers b/c they had to do some kind of 4 page page versus our 10 question-answer(ended up being 2 pgs)paper. TAKE!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a student apart of the Strobel Honors program and someone who had no prior accounting education in high school I can honestly say that Prof Lueders saved me from dropping accounting as my major! She is willing to go slow and help students. TAKE!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: ACCH102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wasn't too bad of a class. I would take her again. We were behind so she cut out 4 chapters, so that might not work in my favor in the future.

She is a very smart lady and does a great job teaching the material. She does have high expectations and assigns a lot of homework. I would recommend getting in a group to do it and also study.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2012<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a terrible teacher. The homework is always way harder than anything she teaches in class. She's very disorganized especially when writing on the board. Also she has no mercy with late homework even if it late for a very valid reason. Don't take this teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102H<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was an alright teacher. A lot of people liked her but she seemed unorganized, especially when she writes on the board which sometimes is confusing. This class sounds like it was a lot easier than Tower. I would recommend the class for the fact that she tells you exactly what is on the midterm and final, which makes studying easier.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great professor, she taught me alot, but she is NOT easy....
