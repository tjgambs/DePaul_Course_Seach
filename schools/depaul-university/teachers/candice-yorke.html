There were three exams and four homeworks. She offered an extra-credit opportunity, which was extremely helpful. It is very possible to get an A in the class. The overall class evg. was a B- and 3 failed, but that was due to laziness.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: QREAS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, but boring and difficult.

If you have to take ISP 120, her class is definitely an easy &quot;A&quot; as long as you do the assignments. She allows revisions on the homework assignments and if you have a question she will respond immediately through e-mail. Definitely recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good prof, highly recommend.
