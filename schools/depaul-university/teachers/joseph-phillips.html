Bad: slow at responding to emails (sometimes not at all, or 48 hours). I did well in the class but I don't feel like I learned much.

Tough grader. Lost a lot of points because code didn't compile.  His assignments are FAR more advanced than the basic code he hoops us through in class. I have lost 7 lbs this last month from overwork and stress and I got B+s and A-s in all  my other classes effortlessly.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2015<br>Class Name: CSC407<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an ok teacher, not very clear but its fine if you do some extra work on reading.

His lecture style rambles a bit, but colorful. He strives to  explain machine instruction and addressing in easy-to-understand language because he knows it's hard to get at first.

He will make a fool of himself just to give you a better chance of retaining the material. Keeps class fun. Recognizes students pay him and his willingness to help reflects this.

He doesn't goes into the details of anything, just giving you a main idea about the subject (which I didn't like).

Participation in his class is required though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: CSC403<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is an easy A class. However the professor doesn't go into details of the subject, just touching the surface. You'll not get that much new stuff in the material. His homeworks are unorganized, but easy you're writing little code in specific parts of the program and running it, just like that.

As others have said he is very energized and tries to keep the class lively.  I walked out with a decent grade which was clearly curved but never felt like I learned the material.

Similar to how other's have picked up on, he speaks in short quick bursts and it is difficult to follow him. His homework assignments are extremely disorganized although not too difficult.

His lectures are not your typical kind, he makes them very entertaining. The homework was straightforward and papers were graded fairly easy.

His enthusiasm is so intense that he'll bounce between subjects within microseconds. He does expect you to talk though, since its a seminar class. The homework is easy (reading and questions to discuss) but sometimes he'll tell us the homework at like 9 pm the night before.

He teaches (arguably) some of the most difficult concepts for Computer Science Majors to grasp.  He was available via email for me the two times I needed him.

He's enthusiastic, which is great for paying attention.  However, he talks a little fast and in bursts, which made it hard for me to follow/understand.

Dynamic personality covers up the lack of teaching.  Gives you assignments and walks you through them; gives exams that are way more difficult and obtuse with little guidance.
