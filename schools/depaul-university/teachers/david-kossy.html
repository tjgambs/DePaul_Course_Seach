			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

He is awesome! Best personality ever, not just for a prof. but in general. I would take him for every class if I could. All I could think when he would come late to class is that he came from somewhere cool</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy tries to come off as cool by saying f*** & s***, but he's not, he grades really harder, and doesn't explain what he wants out of his assignments, u have to work your a** off to get a decent grade, 1 person got an A on our first two assignments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Comp.He's an authentically intelligent man who is passionate about his subject matter and as laid back as they come.

Kossy down talks the students. He puts students on blast in fron t of the entire class and most of the time he doesn't even have his stuff together. I spent the whole hour and a half sitting in that class wondering  why am i  here. Do not take this course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dave is really nice guy!  he makes class fun and interesting! This class is laid back, but as he warns, his papers are a challenge.  Expect to put in effort but if you've ever written a paper its not that big of a deal.  He wants his students to be creative and hes a really funny guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is lazy and tries to hard to be likeable.
