	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

He knows everything about ecology and plants, and I took away many concepts about plants that I wouldn't have learned. Attendance is mandatory since the trips taken are for participation, so go to class. Overall he is great and I am taking his focal point in the spring.

His exams go all over the place and are not a good reflection of material covered in class. Disorganized as well. He is not approachable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2004<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a very good professor, his exams weren't a fair representation of material covered in class. Better as a lab instructor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2004<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For what he was teaching-Plants-he did an ok job. Lectures were boring, but mostly cuz the info was not too exciting. Just read the book for stuff you don't get and TRY to pay attention & u'll be fine. Tests were kinda hard, but he curves tremendously.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2004<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes going to lab fun.

Powerpoint ok, couldn't remember what to teach when it didn't work once. Still young, so he needs more practice. Test was ok-huge curve.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2004<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The easiest science class ever!I got an A and I didnt even buy the book!His tests were kinda hard but the labs were easy(we got to go to the L.P. Zoo for a couple)Just take good notes from his ppt lectures. He's a cool good-looking guy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he was a pretty cool guy.  I didn't do spectacular on the tests, but I still pulled off an A somehow.

All of the labs were out in the field where Ecology takes place. He was really understanding and let me take the final after break b/c of my train. I recommend him to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2004<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>4 tests, some quizzes. teaches class with a powerpoint presentation. tests aren't fair - they don't cover the material well, only certain parts of the material. unless youre really good in this subject, don't take him. i wish i didnt.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2004<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an awesome professor.

However, his tests are all about applying the material to the real world.

I hate his exams though.  I would be better if the exam were straight forward instead of being on how to apply the material to real life experiences.  Other than that the course is cool.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
