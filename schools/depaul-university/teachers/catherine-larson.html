She mixes things up.  She often put the student in the place of their future students.  She engages like no body's business.  She's professional and awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: EE344<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was very tedious. She was enthusiastic, but often times unclear with her assignments. Alot of us would leave class feeling so overwhelmed and confused. She was an extremely hard grader of lesson plans. Just a headache, overall.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2012<br>Class Name: ECE286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely love her, she makes class so much fun and very helpful. All the assignments are clear and directly related to the things we do in class. We DO everything, which makes it a lot more memorable of an experience. I would definitely reccommend this class! :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2010<br>Class Name: EE344<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the reason I was able to finish my spring quarter. Nothing but the highest of praise from me. The class is interesting and you will learn alot if you get a chance please take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2009<br>Class Name: EE344<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Larsen is extremely nice and helpful. She always looks out for her students best interests. You learn new and interesting ways to integrate the arts into your lessons. Plus We get to do some of those lessons, which can be pretty fun, especially the art ones! I think she is a great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2005<br>Class Name: MED<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Larsen is one of the best professors I had at DePaul.  Her assignments are very useful if you end up in a music classroom.  I hope the school of education appreciates her because the school of music is missing out on a first class teacher.  Thank you, SoM for your continued lack of concern for individuals and continued concern for money.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2005<br>Class Name: TL418<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She plays favorites and grades accordingly. She knows nothing about teaching, or how to prepare teachers. All of her lectures and activities revolve around singing, since that's her area of interest. One of the most awful teachers ever!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2005<br>Class Name: EE344<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is awful because she makes you sing in class!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
