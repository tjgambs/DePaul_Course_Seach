But she's great, she's maternal and encouraging and supportive.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2005<br>Class Name: CMN320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She doesn't tell you what's gonna be on your tests and she pulls stuff outta no-where. She'll ask for a definition of a term that was used ONCE in class. Her performances are SO easy, though. There are 3 tests (the only thing that'll hurt you) but you just read poetry and short stories out loud.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2004<br>Class Name: CAPSTONE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful, and you learn a lot. I really liked her class, and it was easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dont suggest her. She is angry and takes it out on students. If you do take her class don't come in late, and going to the performances helps... a lot. Not too many assignments (which was nice) but then again, the midterm, final and 2 essays count as most of the grade so do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her spoken word class and completely loved it at first. But, some of the things she teaches are pointless and unclear.  She also is very prone to anger outbursts at the least expected times. Yet, she is very encouraging and is usually smiling.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2004<br>Class Name: EXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm afraid of her. I don't know if she likes me or not. Sometimes she's nice, sometimes she's mean. Her class is okay. It's not for sensitive souls.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2004<br>Class Name: CMN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought Dr.Cherry was excellent.  If you are late to class, then of course you should get reprimanded, especially if its a performance class and its rude to walk in on other people's performances.  Overall, I thought she was excellent, from all angles!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2004<br>Class Name: EXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a lame. she makes things seem what they are not. she will be nice for like 5 minutes and then just bust out and start yelling...hey leave ur personal problems at home lady!!..she gave good students, friends of mine, bad grades, for some reason..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2004<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice woman!  I enjoyed this class a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2004<br>Class Name: EXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cherry is a nice outgoing lady. She loves poetry and I took her for a spoken word class. One second she can be cool & then she would just whig out about something like coming in late, kinda like she was bipolar but if she really likes u class is no prob.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
