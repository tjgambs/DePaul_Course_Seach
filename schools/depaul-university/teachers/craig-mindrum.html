When I first got there I dreaded the idea of such a boring class. However he made it more interesting than I thought it could be. Don't be scared of any front he might put up, he's just joking around.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cares about his students. The point of the class seemed to be to make you a better person, not just to teach ethics. (Not everyone likes that, but I did.) He forces you to think about your life and the responsibility you have to people who work for you or will some day.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is great. Only night class that didn't seem 3 hours long. Don't let him scare you, he's great.
