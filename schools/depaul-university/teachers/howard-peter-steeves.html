You will be missing out if you don't take a class with him. I have never had a more fulfilling/rewarding experience at DePaul, nor a more brilliant professor. Everything he says is pure gold. I wish I could take him again, but alas, I am graduating in a few months. Do yourself a favor and take anything he's teaching. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2014<br>Class Name: HONORSPHILOSOP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Steeves is by far the BEST professor I've ever had. His class was fascinating, and I always left with my head spinning from all the amazing things he taught us. He is not only intelligent, but he is accessible and unbelievably kind. He is incredibly genuine and just wants to share his passion. One of those profs who was born to be a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An INCREDIBLE intellect combined with a great sense of humor! Be prepared to read quite a bit; however, he takes a difficult subject and makes it as easily understandable as humanly possible. His lectures are jam-packed with facts and concepts yet entertaining at the same time. Do NOT pass up the opportunity to take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is the greatest professor/teacher that I have had in all my years of school! He is an absolute genius, hilarious and takes a difficult subject (philosophy) and makes it extremely understandable. He's always willing to help students in and out of class. So great that I'm actually having trouble putting it into words.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor I have had! He's like a giant teddy bear. I never read anything for the class but still got an A. If you pay attention in class and take notes, that's all you need, because he explains everything clearly and simply. Plus we watched 4 movies!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2012<br>Class Name: HON350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so incredibly intelligent and nice! I was hesitant to take this class because I'm not too good at understanding philosophy, but the way he explains really hard, abstract concepts is amazingly clear. Take him you will learn so much! The nicest and most genuine genius you will ever meet!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy is a genius. He's humble, nice, and even funny! A fantastic teacher. He was BORN to teach! As long as you pay attention in class, you probably won't have to read as much. But do the readings, it's fun! He doesn't give you work just to give work. He seriously cares about your interest in the class! I'd take him again any day!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Steeves is fair the whole quarter.

He's a great teacher and easy to listen to for an hour and a half! He tries to keep class on schedule, recaps the last class at the start of each lecture, and talks a lot but keeps things discussion oriented...which can lead to some great class time and he allows the discussion to keep going and building rather than stopping</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2010<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an amazing teacher, he really wants he students to understand what he is teaching.

However, his class barely touched on Business Ethics. There was some discussion of issues such as affirmative action, however his class focused mostly on political/social philosphy.

He's so smart and so creative, you wonder why he's JUST A TEACHER&#63;&#63; It almost seems like he's destined for something great. It wouldn't suprise me if he has or is working on his own philosophy. DONT MISS THIS CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Steeves is sooo smart!  And, he's probably one of the most good-nautured, gentle-hearted teachers you will meet.  His classes make you want to pay attention...in addition to his personality!  Great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You are missing out if you don't take this course!  He is so cool, you will be a better person for having been in his presence.  Everyday I left this class with a smile, and it is impossible to do poorly if you take notes on the lectures. Steeves rules!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2004<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Top of the tops!  But DO buy the books!  He wont test over things not in lecture, but we gots to learn-and he inspires you to go read and learn.  He is, without doubt, the best prof at depaul.  Perhaps the best in all time and space. :-)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2004<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr Steeves is a great teacher and a great man. He makes philosophy interesting and fun. You watch movies and the only stuff you have to know is talked about in class so dont buy the books.
