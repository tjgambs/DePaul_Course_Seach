He's like a unicorn. This was a capstone class in Philosophy, but I'm positive he is the same with all his other courses as well. When discussing an extremely complex theory he is able to break it down in a way to make the most confused undergraduate understand. He's inspiring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2015<br>Class Name: PHL391<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Steeves is AMAZING. You will be missing out if you don't take a class with him. I have never had a more fulfilling/rewarding experience at DePaul, nor a more brilliant professor. Everything he says is pure gold.

His class was fascinating, and I always left with my head spinning from all the amazing things he taught us. He is not only intelligent, but he is accessible and unbelievably kind.
