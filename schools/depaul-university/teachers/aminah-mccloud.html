			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Buy Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />

Teaching is probably just about the only thing you can do with an advanced degree in religion.  She can be very cool and down to earth sometimes, and then other times she throws other students under the bus.  Overall the class brings up some important issues, but is not a history class, and can feel pointless.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2015<br>Class Name: REL223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is absolutely ingenious.

The whole class gets involved in discussions, she gives you 4 excused absences!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: REL205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really cool, but doesn't know what she is talking about. I am a pretty decent student, but getting a good in this class is hard. She is very unclear about what she wants on tests. Participation is crucial to this class-20% of your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2004<br>Class Name: REL272<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You cant quite tell if she pepared what she was going to say in class or is coming up with it off the top of her head. She wants HER answers on quizes, not what you think. NO essays to be handed in.  She looks at everything from her perspective.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2004<br>Class Name: REL372<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>you have to read the books (at least 3) and write the books' review up to 4 pages. A lot of reading required in order to get good grade. She is so picky in grammer more then English techer. She wants a lot of discussion in class.Average grade point is B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2004<br>Class Name: REL272<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class has a very informal feel to it, even the dumb students feel smart. There is a lot of reading, if u dont read you will suffer, only homework is reading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2004<br>Class Name: REL266<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>unorganized, bad attitude, but shes not that bad of a grader on her papers.....she will only give you an A-, not an A.  We had 3 papers, and I got 3 A-'s.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2004<br>Class Name: RL343<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All this prof did every class was separate the students into discussion groups. That's it. She didn't even seem to have a great grasp on the material. If you repeat the few things she does say in class in your papers, it's an easy A though.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
