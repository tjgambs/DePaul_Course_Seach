But his quizzes are impossible. I read every week and take notes, but end up with a 5/10 or 6/10 on every quiz. I usually get all A's, but i'm barley hanging onto a C. This is the hardest class I have ever taken at DePaul. If history is not your passion or major, avoid. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2015<br>Class Name: HST171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall it's was a great class. You can tell History is his life so expect very informative lectures. Quizzes every Thursday. My advice would be to jot down key information while reading the sources assigned.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2015<br>Class Name: HST171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher who's very interested in history.

I also would recommend REALLY reading the textbook & not just skimming bc the questions on the quizzes are  hard. I didn't have a book the whole quarter due to a shipping mishap but he was really nice about it. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2015<br>Class Name: HIST285<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Miller really knows his stuff.

Weekly tests  on those readings ask you the most difficult details, which account for a whopping 35% of your grade. 100% agree with the reviewer below. Tough grader and expects a lot...

Be prepared to be quizzed on the most obscure parts of the reading. He does not post grades online so you never know how you're doing in the class unless you ask him (be prepared for a vague answer). I would not take this class unless you already have a PhD on Ancient Rome.. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2015<br>Class Name: HST171<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Miller was a super great guy. Super understanding person, I remember we had a disagreement about my Midterm Paper grade, after discussing my view with him he took a second look at the paper and moved my grade up by an entire letter grade. Also, extremely clear when it comes to what he expects out of his students throughout the quarter. Take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2015<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Miller really knows what he's teaching and this made assignments so much easier.

He knows EVERYTHING about the subject and he had amazing lectures. You MUST read if you want to get a good weekly quiz score. He is an incredibly nice guy and will clarify if confused.

The lectures were more like conversations as he encouraged participation and made it easy to do so. The assignments aren't too bad and he's available for assistance. His aim is not to make it difficult to pass the class--he's there for any questions or assistance. One of my favorite professors and classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: HIST290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Very passionate about the history of England.

He's such a nice guy and clearly interested in the topic, but he's an awful teacher. SO much reading for a 100 level course and he picks the most obscure parts of the reading to quiz you on, so you basically have to be an expert on everything to even pass this stupid class.

Loved the professor. He's a no nonsense type of guy. Will make you work for your grade which is what a good professor does. You NEED to read and NEED to go to class, you will benefit and your grade will go up. Not reading = failing. Reading isn't bad at all. You're in college, get used to it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2011<br>Class Name: HST171<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HST 171 WITH MILLER. it will be the biggest mistake you have ever made. the amount of effort he expects is atrocious and you will waste all of your time for other classes studying for his awful weekly tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2011<br>Class Name: HIST171<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A if you are interested in history.

His grading is not fair nor is it impartial. In fact, his grading is ambiguous and unclear. Prepare to work harder in this 100 level class than any other 300 level class. Excellent class for history majors but not for students trying to graduate!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2010<br>Class Name: HST292<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not reccomended for non-history majors.

His expectations for an elective class is ridiculous. I am a hist lover, but all that he is focus on is sources, sources, sources. The weekly readings are hard to understand & his quizzes are tricky. He is a hard grader. The final is dumb, he needs to realize that not everyones a hist major. I regret taking him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2010<br>Class Name: HST171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, the class is a lot of reading but Dr. Miller is probably one of more laid back professors at DePaul. His lectures are interesting and is really passionate about the subject. He is really helpful outside of class and goes over the final material in-class. Overall, the class is fair if you do the work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: HST171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers I've had at Depaul.  He knows his material, has been to the places that you discuss in class, and is very engaging.  Class is all powerpoint presentations full of personal pictures but are very entertaining.  Take good notes and do the reading and there isn't any reason you shouldn't do well even if you don't like history.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2009<br>Class Name: HIST171<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO Not take him unless you love the middle ages. If you just need a history elective this is not the class for you. Also he tells you to buy two books, You only use one so if you get stuck in this class only buy Reading th M A Source book.Final is soo much work 7 essays in class must provide sources not allowed to use note card. Stay AWAY!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: HIST171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher who is very passionate about Medieval History.

His lectures are somewhat engaging even if you don't like history. Weekly quizzes on the readings, 5-page paper and take home final.

The biggest problem is that he is a Medievalist focusing on England and France. The first 3 classes out of ten are medieval history and he only glosses over the Renaissance. So if you are interested in the Renaissance or Italian history, you might want to try a different professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2008<br>Class Name: HST211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE him!

It will take a good amount of your time and effort, so this is not a blow off class by any means.
