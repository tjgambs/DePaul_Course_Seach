He'd sooner chew off his own arm than admit he's wrong or incorrect. If he doesn't know something, he will feign that it is beneath him to even answer, and that it's your job to find these things out on your own.  But still, not a bad guy underneath it all, and you will learn.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: ENGBIBLEASLIT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher-dry sense of humor-very knowledgable about what he is teaching and class is well-planned...take him!  10% participation/attendence, 40% midterm, 50& final (tests are in class essays)...only hw during quarter is reading...thorough discussions about readings in class...just take notes</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENG434<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2005<br>Class Name: GRADLIT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arrogrant and bratty with a fake elitist accent to boot.

Thoroughly enjoyed his classes and his sarcastic sense of humor.  I disagree that he is misogynistic.  He went out of his way to include readings by Restoration/18th Century female authors.  I recommend his Bible & Horror Lit classes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2005<br>Class Name: RESTORATIONLIT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i hate him and you will too</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2005<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: ENG280AND284<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Parker is great. He is extremely smart and really funny as well. He is very clear on what he expects of his students and gives students a chance to improve their grades with an extra credit paper.
