Keeps class interesting and likes student involvement. As long as you go to most of the classes and study then you will definitely get an A or B! totally willing to help you whenever you need it! Just one paper, midterm, final, and minimal reading :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2006<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>his midterm seems hard</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: ARTHISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i don't even like art, but somehow he makes it work. i love this guy, he's awesome. all you hafta do is show up and take good notes. it also helps if you make flashcards for the midterm & final. he grades kinda hard on the paper but if you do well on the test then it shouldn't matter too much. just take the class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: ART238<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think he's great!  Term paper is hard but only because doing research on a painting takes a bit more work than a paper on a particular topic.  If I had to take another art course I would take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The whole point of an art history class especially intro is to view and take notes on slides.  He is very enthusiastic and a great teacher--even at 8:30am.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2005<br>Class Name: ART238<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, nice, laid back, does not call you out if you didn't read, won't force you to discuss. He's fair & clear with grading and answers questions outside/after class. Don't have to bust your ass for the paper/midterm/final, just keep up/stay awake. I ended up liking Art History.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Your whole grade is one paper, the midterm, and final. As long as you write down the slides he puts up in class you will pass. Very easy going and carefree enviroment in the classroom.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2005<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>just shows slides all class.very,very,vey boring.midterm is a little difficult,especially if u didnt read or take notes.he is a nice guy,not the best or the worst.u'll survive if u take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: ART238<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Norris is Great!! His lectures are extremely interesting and very clear. He definetely knows what he is talking about too! He gives two big tests and a term paper. Creates a great classroom environment, the most discussion I've ever had in an art history class. Big Plus.... British Accent!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2004<br>Class Name: ART238<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The whole class is slides of paintings. He's an extremely nice guy, but the midterm and final are about 50 paintings memorized to your full extent. Hard grader. Super nice guy. I got a C.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: ART238<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I Love This Man!!
