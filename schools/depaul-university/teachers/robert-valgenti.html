However, he's a great teacher especially taking into considerations that he's a philosophy major which in my opinion only a small handful can edify.

He relates well to all students impartially, has a vast/deep knowledge of this subject, takes time to answer questions completely, his lectures are fun and interesting.

Seriously, this guy was like, the worst teacher/professor whatever I've ever had.  He thinks that just because he's good looking he can act cocky towards students.  I think I learned more about his wardrobe than philosophy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2005<br>Class Name: PHLMGT228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is so arrogant! not helpful at all!

It's true that he expects a lot out of you, but he's really good in that he makes you think in ways you never would have otherwise.  His papers are tough in that he wants for you to write them as if you are a philosopher.  I learned a lot from this class & am v. gratef</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mostly an ineffective teacher because much of what he says and teaches is driven by his hardcore liberal beliefs and that hurts his credibility.

He is so easy.  He talks, and you have easy assignments.  It is boring.  Just sit there, and you'll be fine.  Don't even have to listen.  Group Project though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2004<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although he is really intelligent and can sometimes be interesting, overall, I found the class to be dry and uninspiring - the very things philosophy should noy be.

For a lower level class, there is quite a bit of work.  If you can find another Sophomore seminar I would suggest taking that instead.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A hard grader, he'll tell you himself.
