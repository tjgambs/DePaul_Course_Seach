You may have to fight for your grade a little at the end of the quarter because he will most likely mess up with the inputting of the grades.  He may be knowledgeable, but his lectures are painful, and attendance is a must. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: 140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quizzes are verbatim textbook definitions. Lectures are painfully long and awkward if no one participates. Has incredibly odd ticks that will summon his old man scowl. Not worth the headache in terms of constant emailing between him and GA to fix your incorrect D2L grades, but if you're the type who wants A with minimal academic effort, this is it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2015<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kanter is intimidating outwardly, but if you sit toward the front and (at the very least) maintain consciousness through his painful lecture pace, he is a very smart, well-connected guy with a lot of experience and knowledge that he loves to share. I'd take the course again, but I'd be bored to tears doing it. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't make new quizzes, Everyone had been given answer keys by their friends who had him before. Midterm and Final are identical questions from the quizzes. The final project is easy but he doesn't give much direction. He rambles a lot. If you sleep, throw something away, or get up he will yell at you. Easy but boring. Don't buy the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Kanter's course is as boring as it gets. This is to be expected because it is management information systems I guess. The quizzes are straight from the book. There's a confusing Excel project, but it's only worth 10% of the overall grade. Easy class if you want to suffer through it to get the grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is fairly decent my only issue with him was that he didn't remind us about things like quizzes for the first part of the semester, but he got better about it after the midterm. he is interested in the newer technology that comes out and spends a lot of class time discussing it. fair warning he teaches directly from the textbook</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2014<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ok I can see how many students complain because it's a boring class. But what did you expect? yes the class is dull at times,but in terms of teaching he is clear about what you should know on the quiz/exams. The information he teaches are basic yet important. After all, it's all about getting good grades. He also has stopped emailing ppts</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Kanter is somehow a nice teacher, very funny. However his teachings are not  good. In this class, I absolutely learn nothing.  I did well in quiz though. His assignment for this last quarter wasn't  really explained, I bet most students don't even know what to do. While asking about that, he redirected me towards a MIS tutor :( !</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kanter is a very sweet little old man BUT he's an awful teacher. over half the class is spent with him just chatting and ranting about how awesome his iphone and dropbox are. Basically talks straight from the powerpoint if he gets to talking about it at all. Worst is, his quizzes get somewhat difficult and downright hard by the end</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2013<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the hardest part about this class is motivating yourself to go. he emails you the powerpoints for some reason instead of putting them on D2L all in 1 place. it is incredibly frustrating to sit in class because I am "taught" in an hour and a half what I could teach myself in 10 minutes due to his random stories, and extremely long pauses. this guy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy, interesting sense of humor. Very boring and dry class. All about powerpoints and quizzes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2012<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kanter midterm are straight memorization of power points, the book and real life application. Only one project from book, kinda unclear on the answer.  Really nice guy otherwise,he's funny in a grandpa sense but still funny.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He must have gotten in trouble for making this class too easy before, because there are no more open note exams. The quizzes are not helpful, and he uses the slides the book creates. I could honestly tell you I do not remember one thing from his class except how frustrating it was.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2011<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TERRIBLE! Probably the worst I've had at Depaul. Still have no idea what the class is about or when it'll be useful. He's completely changed his curriculm bc mid and final are NOT open note. There are no practice quizzes and will say the opposite of what the book says. Project is a legit joke. Complete waste or my time and money.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2011<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of a boring class but really easy.  All you do is read the chapters and then take quizzes.  Study your quizzes for the mid/final because they are pretty much identical.  Highly recommended if you need to boost your GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2011<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class sucks he does not know how to teach and he tries to be cool and use his Ipad which he doesnt even know how to use. Take this class if you want to hear stupid jokes that arent even funny. Its an easy class but i would recommend another teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dry stuff, but at least he tries to tell funny stories to help. Weekly quizzes which are basically questions taken from his practice quizzes. Midterm and final are open note. Research and excel assignment didn't teach me anything. Though he is very understanding, esp if you have discrepencies about quiz/test questions. Talk to him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>yes, it's an easy grade with this professor, but we haven't done a single thing where he didn't mess something up! you have to constantly watch your grade and double check his work to make sure he won't lower your grade. the A is almost not worth the frustration!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible. terrible. projects make no sense,and his assignments are completely pointless. There are practice quizzes that provide you with the answers to the weekly quizzes, and the exams are open note. You don't learn a thing, and his class is nearly impossible to sit through. I honestly don't care about his iPhone. Or his calculator watch</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor.  His assignments don't make sense, and if you ask for clarification he'll look at you like you're dumb for even asking. He belittles students to make himself look better. I tried giving him a chance, but he's just a grumpy man.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kanter is awesome. i dont know what these people are talking about. I failed like 2 of his quizzes and got a C on the midterm and still got an A in the class. He has practice quizzes on bb which are exactly like the quizzes in class! Memorize them and you will pass! He lets you use all slides on final and midterm. Recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a sweet guy.  Just do whatever he asks, and it's always good to talk to him before class when he's eating his muffin because if he likes you, you will probably get a better grade.  A little off topic, but a generally easy prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2009<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is the worst I have ever had. Constantly sending random emails, unorganized and always off topic.  Easy for the most part, but you will learn nothing (isn't that why we pay for the &quot;DePaul education&quot;&#63;)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2009<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has a lot of connections.  If you are a student going into business, he is an endless source of information.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2009<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is smart, humorous and his off-tangent stories are actually good to listen to. I don't why he's rated bad here, maybe because he makes students do work.... or maybe because he isn't a teacher who'll read the text book for you. I like commomn-sense professors.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2009<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he was going to be horrible from all of the reviews on here, but he wasn't that bad. He actually dropped a paper because we asked him to do it and all of his tests are open note. I got a B+ in the class even though I failed 3 out of 7 quizzes.

He has a certain &quot;old man humor&quot; which is very enjoyable. He goes off on tangets sometimes, but they are usually connected to what we are learning. Make sure he knows you and you will do fine. All of the quizzes are straight from the book. As long as you read, you will pass.

He goes off on absurd, but pretty hilarious, tangents constantly, teaches very little material, but the class is easy.

Attendnance is mandatory, he argues with you when you ask him a question, he never talks about the book... yet tests on it. He has you write papers that he does not read.

Quizes are fine if you read the book and the midterm and final are deried from them.  The group project was hard because he did not install accountability for each member.

Class covered CH 1-9 but he skipped CH 5 and CH 8 (still on exams). The best way to get an A is read the chapters thoroughly and complete the HW before class.  Exams were take home. DON'T take him if you want to learn accounting.  Lecture is required but useless.  Better off reading the book.
