			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

She is intelligent, sarcastic (somewhat cynical) and applies the course content to the practical lives of students. You can get by without doing the readings, but then you are really just shortchanging yourself because the content is fascinating. Take her class, be a critical consumer!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: ENV150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely loved Professor Willard. I learned so much in her class and she is extremely hilarious. It was hard to be bored in her class.

She is very thorough given the amount of subjects she needs to instruct.  She respects everyone and in turn her students respect her.  I wish that I took this class as a freshman because it will make you love DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2010<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barb is a lot of fun.

Three speeches. If you give your last speech early, you have the last two weeks to do nothing! Barb makes 8 am fun! Do not buy the book.

I literally was one of those students who absolutely feared speaking in public.  After taking her class, I am now seriously able to give speaches in my other classes or in public confidently.

There was a midterm and final exam along with a 8-10 pg final paper. Does a lot of group activities. Towards the end the class became more enojable! she never takes attendance but does not post powerpoints=wats on exams</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2008<br>Class Name: CMN324<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so passionate about the subjects she teaches.  You learn SOOO much!  Makes you REALLY start to think about the world. I never really read anything because she's so good at lecturing (and I still got A's on the exams).  Just take good notes, and study off of those.  The paper is easy and she's a very fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2007<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enough about the precious little animals, already!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2007<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barb is great! very fun and cares a lot about her students. crystal clear in what she is looking for in the speeches and she creates a very positive and comfortable environment to give speeches. 3  easy test - if you go to class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2007<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is wonderful!
