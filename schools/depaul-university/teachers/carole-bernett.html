Fair amount of homework, very supportive and genuinely interested in students. Her notes are very extensive and almost another textbook. Completed course feeling great about my abilities with SAS, and ready for more stat classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2010<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a nice professor! she really wants everyone to do well. She is extremely helpful and makes herself available if you need anything. take her. stats isn't easy but she gives you everything you need to get a good grade. lots of hand outs and you are allowed to use formula sheets that she puts together for you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2008<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Goo teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: MAT261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do the takehomes, and homework (if you can get A in all tests you don't have to do homework.  I got an A without doing any of the homework).  Her class was so easy, you can take a sheet of equations for tests... I think everyone in my class got an A.  I finished her final in half an hour.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2006<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is pretty easy but grades strange on some of her tests. takes a lot of insignificant points off but if you do well and look like your trying you will get the grade you want.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice women. The final took 10 students about 3 hours long. She should retire.

She is such a nice lady and truly wants her students to do well and understand. She makes herself as available as possible and is understanding of things going on for her students outside of class. I would definitely recommend her for this class!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2006<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Material is hard but she is VERY helpful. First two tests were easy and I got a A's but the final was ridiculous! sooooo HARD! I didnt think I had to study that much because I did so well on the other tests...but i was definetely caught off guard. Final is cummulative.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: BUSINESSCALC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: SASCOURSE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2004<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2004<br>Class Name: MATH101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2004<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really knows her stuff but the downfall is that she's old and needs to retire.  At times she teaches effectively and at other times, she rushes through the material as if it was common knowledge.  If you're gonna take her, take her 2 times a week.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
