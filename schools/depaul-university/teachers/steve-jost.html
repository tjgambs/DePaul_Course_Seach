			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

I think he's one of the best programming professors at this school and it shows.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2015<br>Class Name: CSC423<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor.

TAKE HIM ...GPA BOOST</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: GPH205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are alot of assignments, but it's easy. He curves test and lets you use notes on midterm and final. He's an easy grader and gives you opportunities to do well in the class. I would recommend it b/c it's better than an actual history class. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2008<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest A at DePaul. If you can't do an assignment, he does it for you. Easiest grader. You can also steal others work offline and alter it if you want. Kind of a joke to be honest with you. Take it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2007<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was so stupid... I could add faster than he could.  He would constantly have to take out 5 mintues so he could reteach to himself what he was trying to teach to us!  I felt like his teaching methods were an absolute joke and I was offended to have had to learn from a guy like this!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's such a funny man!  Typical nerd, but really cool and laid back!  He's enjoyable and the class is easy - plus you are by a computer and you can surf the web when the class gets boring.  TAKE THIS CLASS - easy and he's a great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2006<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A basically if you have any idea of what you are doing</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is so easy.  He shows you how to do everything, and all of the assignments can be done in class.  There are two major assignments that you have to spend more time on, but they are so easy.  Everything about this class was easy. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2005<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and easy class.

I had to email him several times, to get an assignment graded. Hes kind of absent minded, and he is oblivious to the cheating going on throughout the exams. He reminds me of harry from dumb and dumber. Take his class for sure though</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy, but his methods of teaching are bad. He takes forever to explain something that should take five minutes, and then sometimes he just goes to fast! Didnt pay attention. Take this class with McFall.
