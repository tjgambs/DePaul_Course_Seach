Becomes visibly annoyed when students ask for help. His review guides for quizzesexams are USELESS. I would have finished with a much higher grade had I known that going into the course. He can be vague while teaching some material. Other than that, he's an alright professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2015<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Berry has been one of my favorite professors at DePaul!! 3 exams & an optional final. Gives out MANY handouts that are almost identical to the exams. If you just practice those problems right before the test, you shouldn't make anything less than a B. He looks out for his students and makes each lecture enjoyable. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2014<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Very intelligent and although he has his own opinion, he loves when others share theirs. I really enjoyed his class. Be there, participate and of course do your share of studying and it should be relatively easy to get a good grade. Would definitely recommend. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Berry is one of the best lecturers I have ever had. He has a great dry sense of humor and makes sure he covers everything in a coherent and plausible time frame. However, he is a hard grader and does not gives breaks. The average midterm grade was a C- (little bit lower than usual). And he doesn't give a lot of real world examples.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Berry is one of the best professors at DePaul.

Just study the handouts over and over and you will do well. 3 exams and a final. Final not mandatory! Offers extra credit. Super Funny with a dry sense of humor. Brought candy for Halloween! Not assessable outside of class. Go to the tutors for extra help they rock! Don't buy the book! You never use it and he gives handouts of problems!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2012<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor.

HW and class handouts reflect midterm and exam questions exactly. DONT BUY BOOK. I practiced every problem before each test and got an A. I guess if you're a non-major, this is as easy as it will get for you!

Attend class and practice the problems from the handouts and you'll do great. Two quizzes that don't land on midterms and finals week and an optional final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2011<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is very difficult to understand, but he is great at explaining the material.

Just wanted to pass, i think he saw that i was trying in class and &quot;gave&quot; me a bonus 1% just so that i could move on to the next course.  Thats a $1600 savings and i now LOVE this man. Thank you</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Explained EVERYTHING very clearly. The material was pretty easy. As long as you come to class, do the in-class worksheets and homework you should be fine. His exams reflect those assignments EXACTLY. Also, if you do well on the first two exams you don't have to take the final, which is nice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2011<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have no idea how come he's the Finance Dep. director when he hates to help students or answer their questions!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2010<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Prof .didnt really understand much in his class but overall it was good.

It would be very helpful if you understand FIN 310. The tests are not easy, but not extremely difficult either, if you study. Try to do well on the first 2 tests, so you don't have to take the final. Overall, he is still better than John Houston.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2010<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He hates when students ask him questions. Once class is over, he is one of the first people to leave the room. If you are the type of person that likes to ask the teacher questions outide of class good luck with him. He flirts with girls, and simply has the &quot;Whatever attitude.&quot; If you are worried about failing he wont care. No extra credit either.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this class if you don't expect to work hard. You have to study for each test. They are much harder then you think they will be. He doesn't use the book, powerpoints, or blackboard. So its all on your notes and worksheets.Study the worksheets! he's annoyed when you come to his office. You will learn alot but not easily.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2009<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor, taken over winter intermission so it was fast but Berry's class was one of the funnest/best. You actually learn and have a laugh and good time in class. 2 papers 2 quizzes a final and a term paper, but are very reasonable. great stories to reinforce his lectures. Cool guy in every way.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor. He made the info in the book seems easy and understandable. Extremely funny, which helps you to get through the class. I wd recommend to come to class because like 90% of the class info will be on the test. The book was not really useful. Just go to the lecture, pay attention and make sure you understand the problems, and u'll get A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best professors at DePaul! Great personality, very clear and understands very well that most people take this class because it's mandatory rather than because it's their major! Highly recommended! I wish he was teaching FIN320 as well...! Thomas Berry for the PRESIDENT!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unbelievably attractive in the weirdest way.  My roomate took this calls with me she does not agree.  If you're a FIN major I think this is your best bet on understanding the information thoroughly.  With that said if you're not a FIN major is this your only bet.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Berry is the best Finance Professor at DePual.

He discourages people to come to his office and yells at them when they do.  He gives you all the worksheets and yes some of the problems are on the exams but not all of them.  I did not like him at all.  There were 3 A's in our class a handful of B's and the rest 90% C's and D's.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great profesor one of the best finance pro at depaul cares about his students, and wants them to pass he helped me understand finance and really enjoy it although it was a nightmare great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a pretty cool professor. Cares a lot about teaching us finance. At first he seemed kind of quiet and boring but in time he wasn't bad. Kinda funny at times. I can't say he made the class very fun, but he did the best he can with finance. He isn't top of the line, but he's probably the best in finance department. He's grading isn't tough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down one of the most enjoyable professors at DePaul.  Berry really stresses seeing his students do well and not just in Finance 310.  If you're nervous about Finance, his methods will really make you feel more confident in the subject.

His exams are very difficult. I got a 20/100 on his exams&#63;!! And the curve is useless since it is a F.

He's about the easiest Finance professor at DPU. I would suggest you take him if you're not a Finance Major. He goes through the material really fast, and you don't really learn much. His tests and quizzes are easy. So if you're not a FIN major and don't really care about the subject, then take him, but if you are then don't.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Finance is hard, but he is really helpful.

I don't believe in kissing ASS in his class, but if you're good at that than take him.

He truly is an awesome professor, more like a friend than teacher. The quizzes were ok, midterm and final were sort of hard. It depends on how much effort u wanna put in, is how much you'll get back.

You will do fine in the class as long as you attend.  Exams are just like homework and in-class worksheets.
