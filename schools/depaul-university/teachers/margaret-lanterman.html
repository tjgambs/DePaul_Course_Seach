However, this is a sculpture class you would think it is all opinionated... which it is... but if the opinion you have does not satisfy Margret then you will most likely be wrong and end up getting points deducted. There is a mid- term. There is a final project. A LOT of work to get and A-.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2015<br>Class Name: LSP 111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Going into this sculpture class I figured it would be one of my easier classes considering its a required first year course for freshman only, and boy was i wrong. This is the hardest class i have and that says a lot. She is a really sweet woman but expects a lot and there is a ton of group work. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2015<br>Class Name: 111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>She's super nice if you are on her good side. And only if you are on her good side. For explore chicago freshman fall quarter she was kind of rude and typically a tough grader. You could never hear what she was saying and she was very unclear about when assignments were due but then expect you to have them done.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2014<br>Class Name: LSP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Toooooo much work for an explore class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: ART283<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've never been so upset to receive an A-.

She loves art and sculpture and really knows what she's talking about. She is very helpful if you ever have questions or if something isn't clear. Easy assignments, little homework and many field trips to see sculptures. I'd definitely recommend her for LSP 111.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Explore chicago sculpture class- So boring.

Well, I no longer have a 4.0 due to the inconsistency, closed mindedness, and lack of teaching skills from this teacher. I put more effort into this course than any other of my courses, and I along with many other classmates was openly shunned and humiliated by this woman.

She says one thing in class and then the next class shell tell you not to do the thing she said to do. She grades really hard. Unless your a terrific drawer/painter you will not do good in this class. She is also one of the most annoying people i have ever heard.

Very much like Ms. Frizzle.

To the point of boredom, but if you stay awake you really can learn a lot from her.  She was an extremely kind woman and she reminds me of ms. frizzle from the magic school bus books, because she was always excited and waving her arms around when we were walking around downtown.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2007<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First of all, you HAVE to go to class if you want to get an A. She really does keep track of attendance. Secondly, she WANTS to give you an A, so you don't really have to try too hard. I had absolutely no art background & I got an A+. Just do the homework the way she wants to see it done & you'll be fine. The class was boring but survivable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2007<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't think I've ever required a more dense person in my entire life. The class was almost impossible to understand. She puts very high standards on assignments she hardly gets herself. I don't even think she knew what she was talking about half the time. She is truly a bizzare woman.

Go for it! she is really sweet and she lets you redo any assigment for a better grade so even if you space you can cover yourself.
