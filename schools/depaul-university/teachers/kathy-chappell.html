She needs to go back to school, or become a middle school teacher. She is a waist of you money, and a waist of time. However, if you want an easy A and you don't care to learn from a high school text book then take her. I hated this class. It was the worst class I have taken at DePaul. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Chappell is not the worst professor out there because she is a fair grader and also has well defined outlines of what she expects from each student. However, she treats the class as if they were still in high school. She picks on students in front of the class. whenever  she lecture she does so in a very monotone voice. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher whether you want to learn or whether you just want an easy A. There is some work in this class, so don't expect to just show up and get an A but the work is very easy, just tedious. She basically gives you what is on the mid-term and final. She really wants participation though, so hope you have some talkative classmates. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2015<br>Class Name: 112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She bumped my grade so I love her.  Her class isn't hard if you turn in the work, I didn't really have to read the book I just skimmed it for the homework.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2015<br>Class Name: SOC105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of work, and random homework assignments she gives and expects to be done two days after being assigned. The first 4 weeks of the class you are expected to turn in work that amounts to almost 60% of your grade so it can be hard but she is an easy grader and very caring. Turn in your work on time and show up and you will be fine. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2015<br>Class Name: SOC105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For a social problems class which I was so excited to take it was horribly boring and disappointing. Her voice drags on and is hard to understand. She taught this class as if it were kindergarten, very by the book (definitions and basic level questions) instead of discussions. Seems to have a very old fashionedoutdated view on social problems </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy "A" for sure. She is an easy grader and there isn't much homework at all. 1 group prez but not difficult. She is very nice and helpful if you come to her for it. She also played a few interesting videos in class. Very old teaching style. No powerpoints, writes definitions by hand on board - can get pretty boring. Not very clear at times, also</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>She constantly emphasizes that it is a seminar-based course, so be prepared to active participation in class. She gives a lot of homework, which is worth only 5% (some ignore at all). You will have midterm and final exams, in addition to these, panel presentation worth 30%. She has high expectations form her students. I don't recommend her class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very old-school teaching style. Attendance is mandatory and is very particular about her assignment guidelines and expectations. Class consisted of a book assignment that we had to read on our own time, midterm essay, a few book assignments, and a 5 minute presentation final. Easy class, helpful teacher, but the work can get very tedious at times.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2012<br>Class Name: SOC360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Chappell has a deep interest in promoting her students to the next level of learning. She will understand if someone is not completely embedded in the social work world, but will inspire those who want to help. She is easy on the grading. The more introspective, the better.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2012<br>Class Name: SOC200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, she is extremely nice and helpful if you seek her assistance. However, for this particular class I was disappointed in the content. Her lectures were extremely dull and unorganized. She was all over the place and didn't give any information that wasn't in the textbook. Assignments were also busy work. Study for midterm & final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2010<br>Class Name: SOC235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXCELLENT TEACHER!!!Material is very clear, and she is very helpful. As long as you complete the readings, the midterm and final will be a breeze. Would def recommend taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2008<br>Class Name: SOC105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She looks intimidating but she's actually really nice. The class is fairly easy. Consists of mid-term, final, and a term paper. We had to read two small novels on our own ...but they were very good books! Her lectures are kinda boring but attend the class and you wont have to read the book!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: SOC361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best prof at depaul by a mile.  truly cares about her students.  genuine and kind.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2007<br>Class Name: SOC105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She wants all of her students to do well in the class.

Take her if you have the chance. She knows her stuff and relates the topic well to the class. Easy-midterm,final, one group project, very little outside work needed for this class-just show up and take some notes and you will do well. She is hillarious, I would take her again!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>as a person, very nice and personable...as a teacher, so easy, my god you could draw pictures on the exams and get points for effort and pass</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is my second class with her and I love her.
