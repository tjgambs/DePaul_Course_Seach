I felt like a learned lots from the class though, and I really liked her as a person too.

I felt like she was learning with us. We got into a big circle and discussed the readings.  There wasn't much variation. She's very nice and was easy to talk to. This teacher was okay; not the best not the worst.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2007<br>Class Name: BBE404<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I realize this is grad school and that professors are not going to lecture. However, this was a very routine class of &quot;get into groups, review the reading, and then we have a group project based on your discussions&quot;. Interesting to learn from other students, but I would have liked to hear a little more from the professor given her expertise.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
