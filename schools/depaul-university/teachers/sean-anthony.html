Great class. Lot's of reading and I learned so much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2009<br>Class Name: HIST111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>well i was just going looking for the next part of this class and I see it is being taught by staff which probably means Shawn Anthony is teaching again. Good experience: material is hard but it is obvious that he knows his stuff and puts lots of time into his class prep. other comments probably from slackers lol.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2009<br>Class Name: HIST220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was obvious that much time and preparation were put into his lectures. Very thorough and comprehensive. If you don't do you work and expect to squeak by, this isn't the class for you. I learned a lot and appreciated the immediate feedback.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2008<br>Class Name: HST225<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He obviously knows his stuff, but he is horrible at conveying this information. He uses PPs in class that are full of text, and then lectures about new information at the same time. Tests are a lot of information, but he gives a study sheet that makes it ridiculously easy as long as you study. I feel like I've learned nothing from this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2008<br>Class Name: HST2OO<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HES A GRADUATE STUDENT AT UIC SO SHOWS LITTLE INTEREST IN TEACHING.  TESTS BASED SOLELY ON MEMORIZATION AND THE TERMS ARE INCOMPREHENSABLE.  LOTS OF READING</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: HST224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although tests WERE really hard,  stuff evened out towards the end. Also, he's pretty laid back otherwise.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2008<br>Class Name: HST224<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although he is obviously very intelligent and knowledgeable about his subject.. it is a 200 level class that, for many, was meant to fulfill a hist. requirement. Tests were ridiculously hard and based on waaay too much info. If students are getting A's on the papers and F's on the tests that should tell the prof. something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: HST223<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
