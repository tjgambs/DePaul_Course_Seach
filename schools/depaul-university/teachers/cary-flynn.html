Accounting isn't the most interesting subject and he doesn't exactly contribute to make it any less boring. He's willing to help so that you can pass. Homework and quizzes are online. Attend accounting lab, class isn't mandatory but you might need it. 1 midterm & 1 final. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2015<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Rather not say</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely won't recommend this professor. As an Accounting student, it's pretty hard to understand his method and that he doesn't uses power point lectures. HW and quizzes are done online in cengage now, but, he never drops the lowest quiz score. Avoid at all cost.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2015<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I hardly came to class cuz he was so confusing. His handwriting is so messy and sometimes he forgets the point of what he's saying. I was better off going to lab and reading the text book cuz that's what he bases the online homework and quizzes  off of</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Goes over the questions from the homework and quizzes the day after they are due, which is helpful. Classes aren't mandatory, but are really helpful to go to. He's a nice teacher, but he doesn't go over too much about the information other than what was on the homework quiz. Homework and quizzes are online, but midterm and final are not. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The poor guy really knows what he is talking about and likes the subject, but I just don't think he should be teaching. He has a very quiet ignorable voice and you leave the class feeling like you didn't learn anything. He will go over like 14 of a chapter and leave the rest to you reading it and the labs. Nice guy that cares but not very helpful</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accounting can be hard to grasp. I was lost for the first 4 weeks but then it all just clicked. Professor is helpful. Goes over online quizzes and homework the next day. Basically tells you what will be on the midterm and final (not that you shouldn't already know what to expect). He's always available to help you. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accounting is not an easy class in general but Professor Flynn's class is not hard. He tells you exactly what you need to know and if it's not clear he has no problem explaining. Class is not mandatory but its extremely helpful to go. The only problem is his class is easier than the others so the midterm and final exam are pretty hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Flynn is an intelligible man and knows his stuff but his teaching method isn't appropriate for a class setting. He talks about his experiences, which is great but never truly referred to the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Accounting before & knew I was going to have to really study this quarter.  I didn't do well on the midterm and talked to him. He offered to meet with me after class & figure out where I needed the extra help.  I met with him once a week to review.  Needless to say I passed & if it wasn't for his help I probably would still be in accounting!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher. Explains things well and uses real life examples. Goes over everything that will be on the midterm and final. All of the homework is online.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice guy, however he mumbles a lot and writes small. He sometimes mixes up his words and confuses students. All the homework and quizzes are online and he gives a generous curve. I spent a lot of time teaching myself the material because he is not clear enough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>If you go to class, pay attention you should be fine. Homework and quizzes are online, relatively easy. He always gives real life examples about the material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an awesome professor, I highly recommend for 101! The homework and quizes are all online so it's pretty easy.  He has experience in this field and knows what he's talking about.  Fairly easy A if you show up to class and spend time outside of class looking over notes.  He prepares you very well for midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring class. Really easy to do well, but if you actually have an interest in accounting, I would not recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice, gentle human, who wants everyone to do well.  Very boring but helpful lecture, I wish every professor was this good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2012<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WOW IS HIS CLASS BORING.  he is a very nice guy and is willing to help all the time.  And when you get help you learn alot, i just dont understand why he doesnt do that in class. His practice midterms and finals mirror the the midterm and final exams themselves. From what i heard he is the better of the accounting teachers at depaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2012<br>Class Name: ACT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy that is always willing to help. His prior experience in the field allows him to give real-world examples. I would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2012<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Professor Flynn. He was always willing to help his students during class and outside of class. Gives out midterm practice tests and final practice tests which were extremely helpful and included questions that were on the final exams. If you speak up when you need help and pay attention in Flynn's class, it'll be an easy pass.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Flynn is really nice and very approachable for help. I would really recommend taking him, his practice exams are very similar to the exams. Overall very good accounting Professor. If he taught Acc 102 I would have definitely chosen him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2012<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class if you keep up with the weekly online hw and (1hr timed) quizzes. Provides practice exams that are very reflective of actual exam (will email them to you if askd). Need CengageNow - comes with a digital book copy. Do not need to go to class or lab (5%) to get an A in this class. Nice & helpful prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>READ THE BOOK! his lectures do not cover everything in the exam. He did help out a lot. Practice exams. Just stick to the reading schedule, u will be fine. Open book quizzes online, unlimited time. TBH, I did not go to the lab, because people were just copying each other's work for a grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everything is based on the lectures. If you pay attention to the lectures, do the homework, & go to lab you will be fine. I had to put in maybe one hour of my own time every week. Quiz online every week. Very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/24/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He offered to contact him for recommendations. He taught the material well. He was approachable and nice. The class was just homework 5%,participation 5%, quizzes 10%, lab 5%, final 40% and mid term 35%. An A is 93. He never rushed the class or crammed material. He prepared for mid terms and the final with practice exams. It was a great experience.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Fylnn is a great teacher. Highly recommend taking him. Hw was done online through cengage, while the midterm and final were m/c. Attendance isn't mandatory but since acct is somewhat difficult I recommend you go. He will help you the best he can if you have any trouble. Also he gives sample midterms and finals to help you study. Gota B!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Flynn is a nice guy and has lots of experience in the Acc field, but is not a great teacher. I relied on the book and online hw most of the time. Midterm was easy enough and we reviewed for most of the material that was on there. Class is a little dull, but all in all, not that bad.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Agreeed came from a business soo he talks and teaches in a business point not student teaching, I'd recommend getting someone else if you have NO experience with accounting</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Flynn is a tough professor. He is new to teaching coming form the business world and understanding him is hard. Its hard to understand him and most of the stuff I learned was from the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice person, and very helpful, but not a good teacher... plus he has sloppy handwriting. Good luck to you if you are reading this.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Flynn is a nice guy with a lot of real business experience in which he can relate accounting with and give good examples. However, he gives out very few handouts compared to other professors. I am doing well in the class but that is because a lot of the material I learned on my own. I would recommend Flynn if you have previous knowledge of ACC.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First off, Accounting is a tough subject so if you don't keep up with the material you will fail. Second, Flynn is a really nice guy but not that great of a teacher. However, what he lacks in teaching he makes up in helpfulness. He gives you his email and cell number and he's very patient when you sit down and talk to him. Take him if you have to.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2008<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dont know why the rating above says Cary Flynn was a she b/c they Cary Flynn I took was male.Nice guy but he was bad at explaining the material and you HAVE to learn it on yourself or in the lab. Weekly Quiz are difficult Midterm&Final=okay Acct is just a hard subject in general so if you don't study & keep up w/ the material you won't  pass</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
