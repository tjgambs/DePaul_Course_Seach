	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Buy Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />

Without him, my overall DePaul experience could be much better.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2012<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is 100& NUTS. He rants about the most random things, and maybe if you are lucky he will get through a slide. Does not help, can't answer a question without arguing or making a legit point and grades VERY harshly. He grades as if he taught literature... Honestly, this guy needs to be reviewed by DePaul. I think he is off of his meds.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: MGMT300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can honestly say that this professor was not good at all. Like many others say he would go on and on about politics and how life used to be. He would go through power points super quick with out really explaining. I was so lost in this class and so was everyone else based on discussions i would have with other class mates.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2011<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is not too bad at all ! There are some summary articles , few discussions , Midterm and presentation. He grades harshly at first yes ! I remember the midterm's average was 19 out of 30 but at the end everyone did well in the presentations. I got a B. The class is little bit boring but not that bad.I don't see any reason for not taking him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can confidently say that Mathys is the worst professor I've ever had. He goes on for hours about politics, the media, you name it (except HR, of course). No one in class knows what's going on, or when assignments are due, or what to do. All of the other horrible ratings here are true.  Don't waste your tuition money with this guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2010<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Where do I start.  Uses classroom  to rant about politics.  Doesn't care about student's opinions.  Uses a condescending tone.  Keeps saying...back in my day, and talks about students like they're idiots.  No rhyme or reason to class or the way he grades.  20% of grade is hw, attendance, & participation.  If he doesn't like you, you're screwed</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not clear about his expectations, and never really teaches anything in the class itself. Harsh grader, the midterm is pretty brutal. The only upside is that he hardly ever takes attendance</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2010<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took the intersession class. If you put any sort of effort into the class you will get a good grade. Other than that the class is confusing. The tests, which are essay, are not clear and hard to follow. Class participation grades are given out randomly, not based on actual participation. Basically you don't learn much, but he's a fairly easy grader</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2009<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Old timer is not that bad. Took intersession class and it was well worth not taking this as a 10 week course. Actually learned some things in this class though he does tend to tell you his personal political beliefs often. Not the best professor I've had, but far from the worst. Actually learned some  things about HRM.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2009<br>Class Name: MGMT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took the intersession class. Mathys talks about global warming being a hoax, how great the Chinese are, how bad Obama is. He does not talk about HR. Waste of time and money. His grading is totally subjective. Exams are all essay (take home). Class participation is at his discretion (20% of grade & your never know where you stand).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2009<br>Class Name: MGMT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't provide clear instructions. He goes off on a lot of tangents & continuously jumps on his republican soap box. He spends so much time talking about other things that he crams a 3 hr lecture into the last 20 mins of class. He didn't even complete 3 sets of lecture notes. Doesn't explain concepts clearly. He's a waste of my time & money.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2009<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy does not teach at all.  He talks about how he played basketball as a kid as well as china and politics.  NOT AT ALL ABOUT MANAGEMENT. DO not take him at all.  I did well in class, but he is a terrible teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very knowledgeable person. It is true that he does not follow the textbook all the time, but you get to hear a lot of interesting stories. 4 quizzes, drops the lowest, midterm & final, homeworks and group presentation. He does not curve the exam, but he curves the final grade!!! I just studied from his power points and got an A!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is awful!  He stands up there doesn't teach, just rants about politics the entire time.  He does not explain anything well, exams are hard, and the pages he tells you to read don't match to the topics.  Don't take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talks waaaaaaaaaaay too much about politics, very inapropriate all the time. Grading, class requiremnts, assignments all very vague. over all not a hard class but a lot of busy work. Did get out early alot, thats a plus. but the grading is rediculous.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2008<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>4 quizzes, drops lowest. Midterm, Final, group project. Pretty straightforward and easy class, i really thought he was a sweet man, boring, but you will learn something. Not hard to get an A. Didn't really use book....</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok. I had no idea what was going on the entire time, but I came out with a solid A. He drops a quiz and a few HW grades too. All exam and quiz's are essay. The essays are given the first day of class. He narrows the essays down even more before the exam. If you study those concepts, go ahead and add an A+ to your GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2007<br>Class Name: MGMT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes he is a republican... I guess that is the only thing I like about him. The class wasn't extremely hard, but I could have taken someone else. The group project was very confusing to me and to some other people also. Quizzes and exams in essay format. I hated that....</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures can be somewhat dry but overall it is a very informative course and all the materials are very clear. The midterm and final consist of essay questions and he tells you exactly what to study. Mostly everything he expects you to know can be found on blackboard. Make sure to choose a good group for the project and you will be fine, take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fairly easy grader, only counts about 80% of HW and quizes. 1 easy group project. Final/mid are hit or miss, 5 essay questions each, altho doing hw helps, as does him pinpointing the topics. Book is good supplement. He's very old school but i find that very comical and so may others. Not really as bad as everyone makes him out to be</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously, this guy is terrible.  He's unable to use real world examples and teaches from textbook theories only.  Save your money, time, and GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Mathys is the epitome of vague. He bombards you with information on Blackboard and seriously stresses participation online and in class. Take-home midterm and final exam are not easy. He's a tough grader, so beware!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>probably the most boring class i have ever taken. he just rambles on, but you only need to study like 10 slides for the tests. most of your grade is this huge group project which is fairly obnoxious. take someone else if possible. if not, its a fairly easy A but kind of horrible to endure</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2007<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HIs class is like being stuck in a nightmare.  Directions are plentiful and vague.  No one really knows what he wants you to do.  He is the opposite of all the great professors I ahve seen so far at DePaul.  Not only does he think his opinion is right, and his HR policies of 30 years ago, he tells everyone they are wrong if any disagreement happens</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's...shall we say, set in his ways.  I don't know how on earth he grades, but if you study the main points of the course and do well on the group project, you'll be fine.  But if you looking for a professor who's going to astound you, keep looking.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very nice guy, and is a pretty decent teacher.  There is homework every week, but not much.  Tough grader on papers, but they aren't that hard.  One group project.  He rants alot with his political views, but this was a fun and easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nick Mathys is the kinda person where, if you ask him to talk about a dog, he give a full discussion on cats first. He goes off on these random tangents...which makes it very hard to pay attention for long periods of time. Other than that the class is  very easy and he is a nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: MGMT300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mathys isn't THAT bad. All these ratings make him out to be horrible. He's hard, yes. He's boring, yes. But he's not evil and out to get you or anything. I didn't mind his class except for when he went on useless rants which was often. He grades pretty hard on writing assignments too. Take someone else if you can, but if not, he's an okay guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2006<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst class and professor ever.

You do not know what to expect nor does he follow the book or syllabus.

He is a hard grader.  The average on the midterm was a 34/50 and he said the class did very well. (no curve).  The way he presents the material is very boring.

He knew what he was talking, but very often got off the subject.  If you are a very liberal person do not take the class because you will get angry with him for sure.  If you want to do well go to class and study off his slides.  He grades you on what he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A staunch Republican, sitting through an election year quarter was torture.
