	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Buy Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />

Cares very much for his students and what you get out of the class.  He includes a lot of real world material in his class.

Not the most interesting but it’s useful.  He is real good at helping and really cares about his students.  Try and not take anything else this semester.  Overall a brutal class.  P.S. Dont spend your whole semester working on the project.  It’s only 20% of the grade and it can be a nightmare.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2005<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Codina rocks!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2005<br>Class Name: FN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very good professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, not very clear!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a nice person.

Take this class with him during the summer even though its fast he is easier on you then so instead of the midterm you get three quizzes that are from the study guide, one project, and final...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2004<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him during the summer session.
