I love his voice, people says it puts them to sleep but I love it! I learned a lot in that class. As long as you do your work and take great notes you will be fine! By the way did I say that he is really really HOT!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nicest guy ever, very understanding.  Of course the class isn't all that interesting unless you have a passion for art, but it is a lot better than it could be with other professors.  Go to class and take notes on the slides and do the easy papers, and you will most likely get an A like I did.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2005<br>Class Name: LATEMEDIEVAL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love him!!!!!!!!! Teaches in such a clear, organized manor, which is so refreshing as an Art history major. Most are all over the place and make note taking a nightmare. He is so nice and doesn't put himself up on an intellectual pedestool - filling his discussion with useless jargon. A for Shoaf!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2005<br>Class Name: ART244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE CLASS EARLY in morning unless you have slept for the last 10 hours. hard to stay up in class.  Not sure if we really need to remember all these slides.  Get ready to be bored</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: ART240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>2 short paper, a final, attendance, reading journal, and participation determines your grade.  easy enough to get an A. his voice gets a bit irritating and with the lights off it is hard not to go to sleep [but he's not a fan of that]. drink some coffee, and PARTICIPATE and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: ART244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Proffesor Shoaf is a sweetheart. So nice, very smart, well dressed and organized. He keeps to his syllabus and is always positive and helpful. I highly recomend him. 2 papers and a final, with reasonable amounts of work. He is interested what he teaches and knows his stuff! Yay Shoaf!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The cutest teacher ever! Bring coffee to his class because the lights will be out for slides & it is so easy to fall asleep. Despite this, information is interesting and tests are curved. Very enthusiastic about the subject. Don't listen to these other people.  He's sweet!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2005<br>Class Name: ART240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is incredibly boring and has no idea what he has told us nor what he assigns for HW. He was constantly asking us if he assigned something or had us do something. You have to like Art History already or the class is incredibly boring. The only plus is he gives us breaks. Also, he is not that cute.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2005<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an awesome teacher,and he knows the material very well.

Te class doesn't require a lot, mostly class notes. He is very helpful but a little boring. But he is very enthusiastic about his work. I'd opt for a later time b/c at 9:40 Early Medieval Art is just not exciting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2004<br>Class Name: ART115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really cool guy, very nice, though I do admit he is very timid.  He makes it obvious though that he is very interested in the subject and wants to help you learn.

Obviously slides are not the most interesting thing to look at, and can get boring but if you go to the class you will ace the tests, the papers are not hard and the memorization is not bad at all.
