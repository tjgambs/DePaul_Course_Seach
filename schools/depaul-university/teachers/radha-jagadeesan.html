He is absolutely no help and so difficult to learn from. I can hear his screaming from down the hall because he has a constant urge to expedite at the top of his vocal chords, giving me nightmares of this class and my grade. Absolutely ruthless grader. If you don't mind hurting your gpa, then take his class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2015<br>Class Name: CSC300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a difficult professor. He says assignments aren't hard, but they are. He explains the basics of a given topic, but the assignments are much more complicated. His exams are very difficult (average for midterm was 46%). But, on the positive side, he does respond quickly to emailD2L posts, welcomes questions in class, isn't boring, and is funny.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2015<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>Professor was good at keeping my night class attentive due to his blaring voice and constant screaming. He is ignorant when you attempt to participate because he will disrespectfully cut you off. Good luck if you think this is actually an intro class because he wont be any help. I do not recommend especially for CSC 241.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2015<br>Class Name: CSC300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first glance, Radha is a bad teacher. He is a bit eccentric. However, if you read the book, he has some very insightful things to say. His opinions about 300 being a programming bootcamp make sense if you're willing to put in effort. He curves heavily. Very nice man also.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2015<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While an incredibly nice guy, I worked my butt off from day one. This is no intro class, you should have a basic understanding of computer language before taking this class, Radha won't be much help. The only reason I passed with an A- is because he just plopped 40 xtra pts on evry test. Good guy, awful teacher, compensates with large grade curves.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2015<br>Class Name: CSC450<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Jagadeesan is one of the best CS professors DePaul has, if not THE best. He is expressive, passionate, hilarious, and rigorous. His classes are NOT easy. CSC 450 was one of the toughest classes I've taken, but it made me a better programmer because of it. CSC552 was great as well. If you have the chance, I really recommend his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the toughest professors to deal with.  His lectures are confusing and seems uninterested in the subject matter, but rather in making you feel uncomfortable in class. Read the book and prepare to cry before your exams. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2014<br>Class Name: CSC901<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are new to programming do NOT take this professor. Coming from literally no CS experience I found myself in a difficult position understanding his methods of teaching. He is very confusing, never once mentioned the book in his lectures and takes all of assignments/finals straight out of the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: SE450<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hardest and best class I've taken at DePaul. Incredibly engaging lecturer. Gives you everything you need for exams/homeworks in class--didn't crack the book except during open book exams. Final project punishingly long/difficult but worth it. Exams hard by DePaul standards but graded leniently. Allot time as if it was 2 classes and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2013<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's a shame this was my first computing class and I got stuck with this professor. His exams and homework are incredibly difficult and he is a super tough grader which would be fine if he actually taught the material. I had an awful experience and everything I learned in this class was on my own from the textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2013<br>Class Name: CSC450<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very enthusiastic about lectures, but reuses notes from an old class. Exams are brutally difficult, and the homework/projects are VERY time consuming. Lectures did not prepare well for midterm/final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Radha is a unique professor. He's funny, entertaining, inspiring, and very easy to understand. Coming from hardly any programming experience, his homework and labs were challenging. I also liked that each of his lectures had a life lesson to learn in some way. Highly recommended! It's a shame classes are only 10 weeks!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2012<br>Class Name: CSC453<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you can avoid it, dont take him.  His midterm and final are worth most of your grade and they are so hard.  He goes through the material really well like he dumbs it down completely in lecture but then he asks questions on the tests that he talked about for like 2 minutes.  His projects are also super hard and there are no clear instructions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2012<br>Class Name: CSC439<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took computer security with this professor. The lectures were fascinating thanks to his anecdotes, historical perspective, and good overview of the theory. Some homework questions were slightly ambiguous though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2012<br>Class Name: CSC435<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His tests are very difficult. Few questions are covered in class. The tests are odd little booklets providing very little space for answers. He said before the midterm and final if the class gets less than 75% average it is the class' fault. Both midterm and final grades averaged in the 60s with no prefect scores and no curve. It was our fault...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2011<br>Class Name: CSC435<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does not know what he is talking about and the exams are very hard. During the exams you are allowed to use your notes but guess what&#63; Your notes will not help you at all because most of the things that he asks he did not cover in class. In my class, we started in 25 people and by the end of the quarter we were just 18. Do not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: SE450<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are interesting. Exams are difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2009<br>Class Name: SE552<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The way he teach is very exciting Even though, his accent is sometimes hard to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: SE435<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Radha is a cool professor, not too clear and not organize, give you too much material and you do not know where to start.  Exam are crazy, long, and some of the topic he only talk for 3 minutes in class, but he is cool, he knows his course.  He only need to be more organize to be the best.  Recommend take a course with him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: IS433<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree - this isn't the most valuable class for those w/ a technical background.  Radha, though, is a phenomenal professor.  He's insanely engaging and knows his****.  He's well prepared, and the tests are extremely fair.  The class structure is refreshingly different.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2007<br>Class Name: IS433<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is a complete waste of time and money if you already know about systems security, viruses and disaster recovery plans. Homework is way too easy. The final exam is 2 hours and just terms to memorize.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: IS572<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Radha --Is very about the subject but is not what he got his Phd in so he taught the class well for what it was a Basic overiew of security. A lot homework but very easy. The final was a little intense but it was open book -- He gave guide how to use the open book final. Overall not bad for what it was!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2006<br>Class Name: IS433<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just did not get anything after I finished this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2006<br>Class Name: IS572<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This Indian guy is a security maniac. All he wants is make U become the same as him. U’ll have excessive reading, weekly HW, 2 big papers (grammar is a grading key), and an individual presentation. A 40% final covers 2 books and U have to complete 100 questions in 2 hours. Lecture is boring. I cannot understand his English and cheap jokes at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2006<br>Class Name: IS572<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have to respectively disagree with the above rating.  Radha is a great programming teacher.  He is not a good security teacher.  He refuses to allow class discussion.  The final is a regurgitation  of the reading, there is no application, nothing is learned from this class, it is a waste of time.  Not recommended..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2006<br>Class Name: 450<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>None</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: IS572<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Maybe the bad reviews are true for his programming courses, but for IS 572 he was great.He gives great lectures and keeps the class interesting.I didn't really like the format of the class requiring daily student presentations for the 2nd half of the lecture (Boring!).Also reading assignments were a bit excessive.He is a fair grader for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2006<br>Class Name: CNS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE!!! Internet Security is life to him and expects you to know what he knows. Book doesn't help and makes up his own answers. Grading was strictly bias.

He uses others slides which hurt the cause because he doesn't always understand them and rushes through.  Fair with grading but he doesn't prep you well for his very complicated tests.  I like him on a personal note but he needs to work on his teaching skills.  He would be better in a cubicle.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2005<br>Class Name: CNS240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is friendly, but his  midterm and final are hard</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2005<br>Class Name: SE450<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard tests, but fair grader.
