Please follow the rules. What more can she ask for but just a little respect. She respects you. Lots of games and fun things to do even your scene acts. She helps you put it all together and then lots of practice. I earned an A and definitely reccomend her to all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2006<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST TEACHER EVER!!! She takes off points for being late.  Because of our class she now made it if you are more than 15 min. late you are absent.  Played stupid acting games that didn't help at all.  Does not give anybody slack.  Seems nice in the beginning but TRUST me she is the DEVIL!!! Take someone else for sure</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: PRF390<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Thinks she's a total EXPERT and WILL NOT let you give suggestions about how to improve other's scenes. She's SUPER sensitive to foul language and &quot;offensive&quot; things (won't let u use accents in class even for your character). She makes you play dumb games in class (tag- not acting!) It is fun though, and a great elective. It's a nice break!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2005<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nanci Carol is the BEST. She is so much fun in class, and she understands if you are absent - email her before hand and she is really nice - when I was sick she told me to rest up and feel better :)  She tells fun stories and has awesome ideas for scenes.  Class is a blast - take it if you can get in!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2005<br>Class Name: PRF<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very misleading!  Thinks she knows everything about acting, and is very annoying.  Took this class hoping to have fun and play games, but ended up feeling very insecure bc of her know-it-all attitude.  Take a different theatre school teacher!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: PRF380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A must have!  She has got to be THE best acting instructor at DePaul.  ATTEND CLASS EVERYONE, do the work, and it's an &quot;A&quot;.  You will have so much fun and in the process, you'll become a better actor.  She knows her stuff!  A truly great and kind person, really!  Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2005<br>Class Name: PER290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: PRF290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take the class!
