I just looked over the study guide for the final and ended up with an A. Very unorganized lectures. Hard to follow, especially if you are not at all interested in history. He is very nice though!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: HIST182<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class will not be fun. The lectures are very painful and not interesting (and last 90 minutes straight every single class). You can get away with not doing much the entire quarter, but when the final sneaks up a vast amount of studying will need to be done. It was okay for a HIST course, and Rogers is very kind.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is really easy. Lectures can be boring and long at times, but all lecture material posted online so go to class if it helps you. Take him for your history requirements. Grades- a take home midterm, a 3 page historical paper, one presentation/participation/attendance, and final. A must for History requirements.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2011<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is so easy.

A very broad topic. The tests were challenging and the papers were long. We never got out early. In fact, we would often stay late. He's smart, nice and interesting, but he assigned a lot of work. A lot of reading. A fair grader. Be specific. All in all, a lot of work.

He's very approachable,  unfortunately many people take his kindness for granted which is pretty sad since his classes are enriching, it's truly worth it to engage and attend his class and he really loves it when you speak up.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: HIST181<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brilliant man and passionate about history. Picks great material to discuss. I learned a ton. He loves when people participate. Great Class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: HST278<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE PROF ROGERS! he is by far one of my favorite teachers at depaul, simply because you can tell he is a genuinely kind, caring person. it's fun learning from someone who loves what they're teaching</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Rogers is an awesome guy.  Not only does he knows A LOT about history, he is a really understanding guy and values student input.  Sure the class is a bit of a bore, but you can learn a lot if you pay just a little attention.  Easy grader, take home midterm, but the final was a bit tough.  He gives you every opportunity to get an A. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: HIST181<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow this guy actually sparked my interest for history! I really liked this class and this professor is so nice. He is willing to talk to you about anything you don't understand. There are 5 doc. analysis due throughout the class and we had a take home midterm but the final was in class. I would highly recommend this professor & this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2009<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am not going to lie. His class is really boring and he drones on for a long time so you might not learn much however he is the nicest man in the world and is willing to work with you on the material. If you read the textbook on your own you will do fine on the exams. The document analysis were pretty easy too. If you like history then don't take</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2008<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really helpful. If you have a hard time keeping up with the notes, just tell him and he'll post the powerpoints on blackboard. Yeah his class can get boring but it's history and it's not always easy to take in. Midterms aren't bad as long as you study your notes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2008<br>Class Name: HST235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy Projects, Midterm is hard, Final is all written so just read a lot then write your azz off. He's a preety laid back guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2008<br>Class Name: HST235<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very intelligent man knows a lot on the topic he is teaching but has no business being a teacher. He isn't very good at explaining the text but he means well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2008<br>Class Name: HIST235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a boring class, but that's what your expecting with history. He's a really nice guy, responds to email promptly, and hands out multiple extra credit oppurtunites. You have to buy 4 textbooks, try and share but def buy the main one every question from the tests are found when you read the chapters. DO ALL THE READINGS + ATTEND CLASS = EASY A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: HIST101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'll admit he can be quite boring, but it can be difficult to make history exciting in an hour class. He's actually really nice and understanding. It's important to keep up with the readings, otherwise the mid term and final will kick your butt. Final project is fun!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: HST235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>prof. rodgers is the nicest man i have met at DePaul. he knows what he is talking about, if youre willing to learn-youll get alot out of the class. he is great-take him if you want an easy going, understanding professor. also, he knows his students by first name which is always nice</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: HST235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great guy. so what if he doesnt let you out early&#63; isnt that what you pay for&#63; he is extremely knowledgeble on the subject, and willing to help students. take him. you'll learn a lot</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2008<br>Class Name: HIST280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, I will agree with others on here that Rogers is very detailed in his explanations of history.  He is an academic and loves what he teaches.  That being said, I think Professor Rogers is an awesome teacher.  History is one of those subjects that you either love or hate.  Don't bad mouth a good professor because of your lack of interest.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2007<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He goes into great detail about everything. He lectures until the last minute possible. He is pretty strict on attendance and he hands out a lot of stuff in class towards the end. Boring class but its decent grade wise. I wouldn't say its an easy A but you'll get a B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2007<br>Class Name: HIST278<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for History of Religion in America. Terrible class I didn't learn anything. the lectures are boring and the class was way to long. I had him for a night class from 5:45-9:00 and he gave us a break at 8:00 it was terrible. He is a nice guy though and the only assignments are the midterm/final/ and project. Nice guy though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2007<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was pretty cool, easy and flexible. His class is better for History lovers...because he likes details and gets into it, which takes up most class time. We NEVER got out EARLY- he lectures until the last minute- be overall- can be an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2006<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hmm, well I HATE history and this class was OK. Pretty boring but attendence really doesnt matter. I didnt buy the book and didnt read anything and I got an A on both papers. THis final was hard, final prep didnt help me much but all in all OK. Lets you re do the 1st paper for a better grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2006<br>Class Name: HIST280<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy teacher as long as you do the work. He explains everything very well and is an easy grader. You will have to write about three papers, but the final exam is a test. Study hard for the final becasu it will be difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2006<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
