The class would be impossible if he wasnt an easy grader. The tests and papers seem daunting but most people get A's.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2013<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To sum up Dr.Selvaggio; he is passionate but does indeed struggle to communicate outside of the musical realm. From a life of musical study and rigorous methodology, I enjoyed the new taste of the classical genre. I did not learn much, but if I was not into reading music I would have struggled. Only take if you can read and comprehend music.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2009<br>Class Name: MUS101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Selvaggio is great.  He knows a lot about music, feels passionate about the subject, and can play the piano well.  When teaching or answering questions, he tells it the way it is, without being overly formal.  Acts a little hyper at times, but for a music professor, it's a good thing.  My only gripe is spending nearly $150 on the textbook and CDs.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2008<br>Class Name: MUSIC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fred is one of my favorite professors because he is understanding and very helpful.  Even if you have a personal problem he will be able to help. As long as you attend his class and stay on his good side, he will be really easy on you. Fred's the best!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know why everyone's complaining about Fred, he's one of the easiest Honors teachers you'll ever have.  Yeah he can get a little off topic, but he's totally laid back and his interest in the subject is infectious. All of the assignments are doable and you'll probably be surprised with how much you actually like the music.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2007<br>Class Name: MUSC100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decent Professor.  Talks off the subject and things students have some music background.  Three tests and two concert reports.  Tests are fairly difficult and reports are easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Confusing and misleading.  Unorganized and very unclear. His teaching style is all over the place with no direction. I honestly never understood one class because every class he would skip from subject to subject.  AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>smug. edgy. doesn't respond to emails. had potential but didn't fulfill it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2006<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not helpful. Hated class and stressed over it, failed first two tests and wanted to drop class but didn't & I got a B in his class. Wish i would have known he was an easy grader, I wouldn't have stressed so much. Good & funny guy not a good prof. unorganized, lazy, does not like to help outside of class. But worth taking if you want a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: HON203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>eh, he was a bit frazzled and scatterbrained at times, but he has a passion for music, the only problem is that he can't relate his passion to non-music students.  If you are a music major or like music, he is for you.  if you are an amateur then i would probably pick another prof...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2005<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i don't care if he really likes music, he's lazy, rude, unprofessional, unorganized, and i can't stand him already.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2005<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class felt like it was gonna be really hard, but he curved it pretty well. i don't think he's a good teacher, but the class is decent. and he seems like a good guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof. is one of few that genuinely shows how much he loves the subject-unlike others who don't want to bother. Took his course in the summer. Extremely knowledgeable. Definitely recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2004<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>gives study guides that tell you exactly what to cover. explains this in detail in class. gives extra credit chances. plays songs and explains what to listen for. if you can't do well in his class, its not him-- its you! he's a great teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2004<br>Class Name: HON203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class was a pleasure; he has a great sense of humor, really cares about music, and doesn't ask anything unreasonable in terms of work--which is nice, because Hon. 203 is a joke of a class with no right to distract from legitimate work given elsewhere.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2004<br>Class Name: HON203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>has a sense of humor and puts up with his students, which is nice.  thanks for breakfast</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2004<br>Class Name: HON203<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had problems adapting his class to those without a music brackground.
