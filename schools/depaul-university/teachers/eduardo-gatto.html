He offers a ton of extra credit.  He plays favorites, so if he likes you, you will pass.  You will pass the class no matter what, but you might learn nothing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2013<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, you can tell he really loves teaching.  He's happy to help outside of class and encourages participation and asking questions.  Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2013<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to learn something and understand calc 2 then do not take it with this teacher! However, if you understand calc and would you rather teach yourself then take him. His tests are based on hw questions on mml and are fairly straightforward. Oh and watch out for the chalk!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: MATH260<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If there is something I can say about this teacher, his accent must go. I have been mastering math for throughout all my life even before starting preschool. Math has been one of my most competent subjects but I just was not able to stand his lectures. His Italian accent made it so much harder to make out what he was saying.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: MAT262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Play the game, it's like chess! And look out for the chalk. Gatto gives people so many chances to get points. If you don't get do well in his class, you're a cheeseburgler and should consider dropping out or switching your major to marketing or communication :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2010<br>Class Name: MAT262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Gatto is a great professor!  His number 1 concern is that you learn the material.  I would definitely recommend taking a course with him.  If you put in the effort and visit him during office hours you can get a good grade in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2009<br>Class Name: MAT261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hilarious! I thought his class was pretty easy. His accent is a little heavy but he did a lot of examples. His grading allowed for a lot of extra credit opportunities.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2009<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Humorous, wants to please the students. He has a bit of an accent, but nothing that's too hard to understand. There are times when he doesn't understand the question, and he tends to make a few mistakes on the board. Easy grader and tends to take things literally (it's pretty amusing).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/08/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EASY,EXCELLENT TEACHING,ENERGETIC, EXTRA CREDIT,TEST ARE THE REAL EASY, HELPFUL, IF YOU DON'T GET &quot;A&quot; IN HIS CLASS YOU DID DO WHAT HE SAID, IF YOU DON'T GET &quot;B&quot;, THEN YOU DID NOT STUDY....IF YOU FAIL THIS CLASS, CONSIDER SOMETHING CLASS OTHER THAN SCHOOL</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gatto is the man! At first it is hard to understand, but he makes everything easy. I recommend taking him for BMS 125 and 126. Great professor. has an accent and be sure to ask questions if you dont understand!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for BMS 125 and took him again for BMS 126. Most people complain about how terrible these classes are and how difficult they are, and he made them interesting and easy to understand! Best math professor ever!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great math teacher to take. homework once a week, three tests, and extra credit. great teacher and very helpful. always willing to give you extra points after test mistakes. take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gatto is a pretty good teacher. He does have a little bit of an accent but it's not difficult to understand him. He is really nice and approachable. He will help you whenever you need it. If you do poorly on the test you can make up half the points plus he gives extra credit. I would take him again any time!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First math class I have ever understood / enjoyed. Helpful teacher. Easy. Can make up half of the points missed on tests</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I struggle with math and he is the first professor I have had that I walk out of class understanding the material. He allows you to make up missed points and extended his office hours because I couldn't make his original hours. Extremely helpful, and he gives up to 5 extra credit points (out of 100 for the class) for good attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2007<br>Class Name: MAT335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is very difficult, but is structured so that you're pretty much guaranteed a decent grade. Test problems are almost exactly like the homework, and he always has extra credit. You can present problems to make up points on tests and hw. It will be crowded but go to office hours it really helps.He's very laid back, pushes hw deadlines, funny</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His grading policy almost makes it impossible not to get a good grade, especially if you're not lazy. I loved this man's sense of humor. He'll crack a joke out of nowhere and do so with a serious tone, making it even funnier.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gatto is a pretty cool guy.  He is pretty funny and is helpful.  He doesn't always explain things in the best way, but you get used to it.  It is hard material but he does his best to help with this.  He collects homework so you can get points other than test.  Good Teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2006<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a cool prof.  Made a 3 hr night class tolerable and such a great sense of humor.  At the end of the quarter, we said we didn't want to learn any more and he said &quot;ok, I'll teach it next quarter (in 261).&quot; They don't get much cooler.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was painful to sit in!  I took a night class with him and I had to push myself to stay awake...more than half the class would leave during the break.  Could not understand him through his accent and had an extremely odd and unhelful teaching method. Would not recommend for any calc..made it very difficult to understand. Take someone else</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. He puts bonus problems on the exams so you can get more than a 100% on exams! I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>thought he was an easy teacher. he would basically do what we ask him. he would actually give us hw problems that are graded unlike many other teachers. he would also practically do all the problems before we hand them in. also gives many quizes to help our grade. people who rate him poorly are ones who dont take advantage of his teaching methods</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: MAT215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not exactly clear on all his lectures and also not exactly helpful when you present.  he has good days and bad days when you present.  lets you make up tests with presentations.  All around good prof and am taking him again.  funny guy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2006<br>Class Name: MAT215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>soo funny.  he says such goofy things and his accent makes them even funnier.  He is willing to help any student and you can always make up points!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he gives you homework that he has not coverd yet and not let you turn it in late even though he did not teach it. you cant ask any Q during his test eather. BAD TEACHEING METHOD, trust me, im a math major</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>funny guy and kind but teaching is not his field..honestly please dont take him. he is a great guy but he does not apply his teachin methods well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What is everyone that's recommending him ON&#63; Gimme some of that cuz I need it if I don't want to stab myself with my pencil!! He is ridiculous.. sometimes funny but too bad that's not going to help me pass the class!

AHHH!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's funny especially with his accent, very nice and helpful.He collects the h/w,but goes over any problems that students have,so you can fill the problems in right there. one of the tests was takehome because he saw that students were frustrated with material. Recommend to take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME TEACHER..

His teaching is great on Calc...tho I didnt do very well on the tests & homework, and I got by jus fine in the class. RECOMMENDED. Do what you're told in class and ur straight.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not bad... He's a funny guy, wants you to be interested. 4 15pt tests (60pts possible to get to 50- not bad!) and homework (lowest is dropped). I didn't go to tutors, thought i wasn't doing great but ended up rocking the class. Recommended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I cant figure out why anyone would recommend this teacher. Seriously, I learned nothing from him, the tutors had to reteach me every lesson.  Im not bad at math either, I just did not like his style of teaching.  Not recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher! He really wants you to do well and is sincere... :) I recommend any class he teaches.. you can tell he enjoys his job and wants to help you out!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice guy that really cares, if you put the effort into it.  Don't listen to anyone who tells you he's bad in any way whatsoever.  No one's explained as hard a topic as Calculus to me so well before.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A little tough to understand but a very nice teacher.  His tests were relatively easy as was the homework.  I rarely showed up to class and easily got an A.  Class is a breeze if you are decient at math.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an alright teacher, changes the syllabus so that everyone got a much better grade. he's a Dago so if you have hard times with accents stear clear.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2005<br>Class Name: MAT250251<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this guy! If he seen the class struggling he did whatever it took to fix the problem. He took time out of his schedule for group study sessions and even gave you extra credit points if you showed up. I wish all my professors were so accommodating, and had such a desire for their students to do well and learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2005<br>Class Name: MAT215<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor and wants everyone to do good..if you dont do good on the quizzes or midterm you can make up all of the problems to get the points back. As long as you make up all the problems, you can go into the final with a guaranteed 70...be prepared tho, bc making up the problems can take a lot of time outside of class meeting up with him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I ve been through his BMS 125 and BMS 126 classes and loved them. I think he is an amazing prof. I don't think that you need to spend any time at the tutoring center, simply read the book and use his notes. In combination you will understand the problems easily. I highly recommend him!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared for three things: the funniest analogies EVERR, spending LOTS of time in the tutoring center, and working your a** off to get a good grade. I got an A-, but went to the tutoring center all the time to understand what he was TRYING to teach in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2005<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really funny...i liked his style of notes... i'd always be laughing with his analogies... very smart guy. its a tough subject, so be prepared to work hard...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great guy and really tries to get his point across, but his thick Italian accent does get in the way somewhat.  But he's as clear and direct as a Calculus professor can be, and he tries to keep the class in high spirits.  I'd reccomend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher if you are naturally good at math. He teaches you the long way for every problem and makes you do the hw like that but eventually he gives you the shortcut. He is a really nice teacher but sometimes he is confusing. There is no inbetween with him either you love him or hate him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2005<br>Class Name: BMS125126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult to understand bt writes everything he says on board.
