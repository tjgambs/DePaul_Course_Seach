Teaching method is excellent though! Would recommend, but don't expect anything super fun! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: PHL240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div> If you show up to class and keep up with the readings before class then you'll be fine. He creates a discussion-based environment and encourages students to elaborate on their own understandings of the material. You have to write 3 papers but there are no tests or quizzes, and he lets you rewrite. I'd definitely take him again, really enriching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2014<br>Class Name: PHY248MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Take Mr.Griffith! He is awesome professor. Knows what he is teaching and can help you learn. You have easy A as long as you do what he says. We read 3 books and first couple weeks we had a page of summary due once a week. Other than that there is a take home mid-term, group project & take home final! That's all! Good Luck! Easy A!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2014<br>Class Name: PHL280<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>CRITICAL THINKING Prof. doesn't really branch off from the text... isn't great at clarifying. I wasn't a fan.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. James is a very good professor. PHL class could be tough even for intro class and I was very confused after the lecture, however, after having discussion with prof I felt much better. Prof.James is super nice to all the students who has question about PHL, he is also very passion for talking about PHL so do go talk with him! Great prof!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2012<br>Class Name: PHIL401<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>James is a pretty good professor he made the material seem interesting he gives 3 paper no midterm no final and 2Q a week and he explains everything pretty well where you don't need the book</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! Somehow makes it interesting,gets people to participate which makes the class go by quicker!DOESN'T speak in monotone,is waayyyyy better than the other PHL 100 teachers!Readings assigned every week,if you don't read he explains it all in class,must write 2 Q's on reading each week, can be writen out in class, 3 papers, no final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: PHL201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful teacher, great person. Extremely interesting if you have any interest in anything at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>James is a pretty solid professor. Maybe drags on at some points in his lectures at least he has a great interest in philosophy and he's pretty good at explaining difficult material. My class was easy in term of grading and I got a whole lot out of what I think - now - is one of the most brilliant books ever written - The Republic. Good class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Without a doubt the worst teacher I have ever had. He rambles for an hour and a half about useless material, doesn't explain it well, it's all very confusing readings, and on top of that, is a very hard grader. This is philosophy 100 and it is NOT supposed to be this complicated. The class draaaags on and doesn't let you out early, ever. AVOID HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2010<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>James is pretty cool. He knows his stuff and wants people to develope a good understanding of it. HOWEVER, the reading are a total drag, 50-75 pages a week with annoying non-graded summaries due at each class. Participation is easy if you read. He's unclear about what is on the exams and a tough grader. Take good notes and you'll learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would definitely recommend professor Griffith. He really cares about the subject. My suggestion would be to participate in class, and try enjoy the material. He likes it if you show that you care about the subject. He's always calm too, people used to ask DUMB questions to get participation points, but he would still help them out.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't you hate BS reviews&#63; Wanna know if this class is an easy A or not&#63; Here's the review: 3 Papers (25 pts each), 10 pts for weekly 2-3 &#63;'s on reading, 15 pts on attendance/participation. You WILL NOT get an A on papers unless you are an english major. Very picky about papers. The other 25 pts are easy to get. [Challenging A, Easy B]</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i thought this class was so easy. 3 papers, questions every week, participate, and attend class. Im a straight A student and i ended up with a B. not sure how that happened.... EXTREMELY boring and he never lets you out early</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2010<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Griffith is a cool guy, and knows his stuff, but I wouldn't recommend the class.  Tougher grader, not entirely clear about what he wants, only real feedback is editing papers for grammatical errors, not content.  A lot of reading, but he does go over all the material in class well.  Nice guy, but expects a lot for a required class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is amazing. You need to write 3 papers and participate (basically raise hand and answer some questions; not hard at all). My favorite class so far at DePaul. It's very interesting and the professor is just amazing at teaching. Only problem is he never lets you out early :(</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2009<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy is extremely hard. Have to write lots and read a lot as well, get ready to write a lot and read a lot. Quizzes are hard and not even worth anything. Hes very disorganized and a very strict grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Griffith is a good guy. He knows alot and it was an intresting class. I thought i was going to hate this class but 3 papers that are easy. and tells you how to do them. I would take him agian for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT teacher. so knowledgable. will help if you ask for it.  great class discussions. only 3 short papers. easy grader. lenient on absenses and late work.  cool guy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2009<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you talk to him after class about random topics he'll remember you and cut you some slack on papers or late projects. Minimal homework. He's really easy going. The class gets off topic very easily and makes it easy for those who didn't read to get their participation points.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
