Gave us lots of freedom on what we wanted to design.

Very laid back and knew what he was talking about!  This class was for NON MAJORS, so it did not go in depth about creating actual animation, however we did learn lots about different types of animations throughout the years.  No midterm, no final exam, no projects.  YOU WILL ENJOY HIS CLASS, I PROMISE.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2014<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I've had so far! His class is laid back and stress-free. He's truly passionate about what he does and knows a lot about animation. The way he explains things is simple and easy to understand too. Overall, hes a really cool and funny guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: GAM341<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the best professor I've ever had. It was an intro class that was taught like the way an intro class is supposed to be, without much pressure. He didn't have any homework, no final, no midterm, no quizzes etc. All you need to get a good grade is answer some questions on a questioner that he gives you at the end f the course. Great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2013<br>Class Name: ANIMATION101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher ever!!!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
