	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Buy Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />

The professor is very laid back and does her best to ensure that the whole class does well on the exams. She is very helpful after hours. Her exams are basically the homework questions re-hashed. The girl next to me snored through every class and Prof. did nothing. It was quite amuzing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2008<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She wasn't that hard. She doesn't take attendance or check homework...the only grades are two midterms and a final. She is not a bad professor- calculus is hard, so it's not really her fault if you don't get it. She always answered my questions when I approached her. If you do your homework you should get a decent grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not a very good teacher. Does the fact that The average grade on the final was a 46% say anything to you&#63; She goes through examples quick and if she is being picked up after class (night class) dont expect to have your questions asnswered. She does alot a lot of time to review homework! so take advantage because the weekly quizes are on h/w.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She isn't the best Calc prof out there, but not the worst.

She is willing to help and work with you if you are strugglin.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's not as bad as people say-- granted she is not the best math professor on eart, but it's hard to come along a good math teacher these days anyways. She is willing to help you if you don't understand. Attendence not mandatory, tests easy if you get it, puts on a nice curve. She is extremely friendly.

I am a psych major and was able to pull a B in this class...and I rarely went to class. But definitely do the practice problems and go to the two classes before an exam.

Not only does she not know what she's talking about, she doesn't explain the material well. When you ask her questions, she doesn't know how to answer them.

Every single time she writes anything on the board she always writes the problem wrong. Now I will say the class is easy, I didn't buy the book and I still got a B&quot; in the class. But that just means you really have to teach yourself.She will answer questions if you need help.

When I showed up and stayed awake in class, she would make mistakes while giving examples on the board. All you need in this class is the text book and you'll do fine. But there is class work at the end of each class. But at the end of the quarted she lets you make it up.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: MAT147148<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Cohen is a great professor. She cares about her students and trys to make calculus as painless as possible. If you study and do the homework you'll get an A/B+.

I basically taught my self using the book. She only curves if you do bad, if you get a 89% she wil give up a B+ and not a A-. Class is extremely boring, very difficult to stay awake... Take her if you are good at teaching yourself and at math, her tests are kind of easy...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Assumes her students understand all of the material, and moves on fast.

Her curve is awesome--but most likely you need it, because she is not that great of a teacher. She rarely makes sense, and sometimes is very hard to follow.

She has -no- teaching method.  She's lazy; and will not take the necessary steps to help you with her tests.  She is not open to constructive criticism.  Her analogies make no sense.  Everyone is confused.  I feel like she's playing russian roulette with my grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2005<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take her. Period. Everyone is saying the same thing. She is unclear, only confuses people more than helps, and moves so fast you're barely able to copy the problems down let alone understand them.

Overall the class is pretty easy, but she is a little unorganized. If in doubt about anything just ask. Really nice lady. 4 tests, one final, and she takes only the top 4 grades out of the five.

However she was a ****.  She curved big time to those who did bad on the tests (35-60%).  Those who got 85+ did not get a curve or just a tiny bit!  She thought it was fair cuz those who studied should know more.  I would have gotten an A if she had curved mine, but got a B instead. UNFAIR!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2004<br>Class Name: MATH<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's so disorganized!  she'll do a problem and sometimes make a mistake and not realize it until someone points it out.  she teaches the material okay, but i had to teach myself a lot of things.  she's pretty okay, easy-wise.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2004<br>Class Name: MATH<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DONT TAKE ITS BRUTAL</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2004<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed class.  She rushed through things to get everything on the syllabus in.  Don't expect her to push back test dates.  If you go to her office hours she helps a lot.
