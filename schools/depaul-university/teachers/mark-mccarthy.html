			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

He accomplished (has his CMA) and is very insightful if you ask about career paths in industry.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2015<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Tough professor because the whole grade of the course is determined by only two things, the midtermfinal exams. Very long and boring lectures makes it very hard to be engaged in the material. Tests are curved but still hard. Be ready to do a lot of studying on your own because he does not do a effective job of preparing you for exams. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2015<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably one of the hardest professors.

He will not respond to your emails, will not go out of his way in the slightest for you. His class is based around the book and nothing else. Would not recommend at all.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2015<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lazy professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIM. One of the worst professors I have ever had. He is basically the reason why I changed my major from Accounting to Finance. He is awkward, boring, and never engages the class in the material. His midterm and final are ridiculously stupid. They're all multiple choice... for accounting??? Again, do not take this guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2015<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>took this course in the 3 week class - gave little credit for attendance and the rest of the grade was your final exam. grades on a huge curve or else half the class wouldn't pass.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2015<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You only have a midterm and final for the grade. tests are multiple choice problems and short answer problems. gives partial credit sparingly.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2014<br>Class Name: 303<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take the other teacher instead.

He does pretty good at introducing every material but the h.w are not nearly close to the exams. Here is my advice to do well! Read the book do all h.w's in each chapter, but most importantly a good month before exam go online find all practice exams for similar class in different schools like 10 of them and practice !</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very lazy and basically just reads the textbook to the class.

However, the course did not cover that much material. I found that I could just read the textbook, do exercises and gain just about as much knowledge. It was s new course, so he was figuring out pacing and depth to which he should dive into the material</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2014<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class material was challenging (I had no prior accounting experience and over  10 yrs out of school),however the teacher was very good at explaining the various concepts and always willing to  go over a topic again or meet during office hours. I would definitely recommend this class/teacher but not with any additional courses at the same time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2013<br>Class Name: ACC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst professor ever. do not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2013<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems to be knowledgeable and sounds passionate but he can not keep students engaged. He assumes everyone has some good foundation in ACC101 and this is just a slightly advanced version. So, he doesn't do much to convey the sound principles of accountancy BUT sure enough you will be trick tested on that. Don't take him as a first class in acctig</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2013<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Summer Class. He does a great job of getting to the core of the material, and picks practice problems that highlight what you need to know. He's a rare professor who doesn't use powerpoint slides.

He taught the class directly from the text and the course grade was determined only by the midterm and final exams. It wasn't a difficult class, but the tests required some solid studying.  After the fact, he put a slight curve on each test.  Personally, he is a friendly guy who is easy to get along with.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2012<br>Class Name: ACC303H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Only a midterm and a final, optional homework but if you want to do well you have to do it. Tests were relatively hard but he would always be reasonable about grades. If you put a lot of effort you can get an A, if you only do a little you'll probably end up with a B.  He was always very precise and clear and would go over anything if you needed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2012<br>Class Name: ACC303H<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was great. Very informative. I learned a lot. I would recommend you do the problems before class because it really helps. The exams are difficult but just go over the notes you take in class and redo the problems.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken 5 semesters of math, 3 semesters of chemistry, 3 semesters of physics.

The Math computation is not difficult but the amount of material that is required to be memorized is over whelming. you will not be able to</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm had a 15 to 20 percent curve, enough said, you need to read the book a lot and keep up with the readings and homework, cramming this stuff a few days before the exam will not work if you want to get better than a C. He doesnt really teach you anything in class that isnt on D2l, so just read often.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2011<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor for a difficult subject. Grades are based on midterm & final with an extra credit excel assignment. Tests were tough but he gives out practice tests that are extremely helpful. He doesn't collect the homework because he always does it in class. However, I would still recommend doing it for practice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: ACT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is hard and the material is dry no matter what professor you choose.  Professor McCarthy brought a lot of real life experience to the class and really helped me understand the material.  You have to work very hard in his class, but if you have to take this course I would highly recommend taking it with Professor McCarthy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2011<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>McCarthy is a great professor.  Read the book before lectures and after lectures.  Do the homework assignments before class. He uses questions from the CPA exam.  They are difficult and I would recommend studying a full week in advance.  Cramming the night before is a nightmare and impossible-i tried it.  Look over study questions for practice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2011<br>Class Name: ACCACC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knowing how to do all the HW assignments in your sleep will get you a C.

Definitely a challenge, but I worked hard and got an A. McCarthy is very clear and concise with the material and his expectations. Grade is 40% midterm, 60% final, with an excel project offered as extra credit.

First midterm exam is 28ish multiple-choice questions, average difficulty. Second part of the exam is two short problems and and essay question for 30 min (easy stuff). All in all good class, but it's tricky if you are not sure how to prepare for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2010<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He follows the book extensively during the lectures. The tests will be on the exercise he assigns and then review in the class. You will have to screen the book and pick up only what he discussed if you want to be successful. Not a very tough class but still challenging. If you like using the book then he is your professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT303<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Only 3 grades: 2 exams and 1 extra credit assignment. Ace the midterm (40%) or else you're out. The exams are hard, which is why he curves. Nice guy for the most part, I didn't find him very helpful. You can't pass this class by cramming 3 days before the test. If youre in Strobels good luck. Get with a study group if necessary.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2010<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, will often show you shortcuts, and explain how he got there, so the textbook's methods are more supplemental, if unnecessary. It is hard to stay awake just because its accounting, but he does inject a good amount of humor, so its not too bad. Take him, he is awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a dry sense of humor, but he is a very funny, very quirky guy. That definitely helped when I was taking this class over the summer. The content is really dry, but he stays up beat. I wouldn't recommend taking ACC 555 over 5 weeks though. He covers a lot of material, but if you stay on top of the work, you will likely be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2009<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He likes to write &quot;challenging exams&quot; and then grade on a curve. Will take the time to answer questions.  The only thing I found strange was when we were going over the midterm, we weren't allowed to have any books on the table or chairs.  I took this class during the summer so it moved quickly.  Pay attention in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The course itself is hard and kind of dull. But McCarthy is a good professor. He gives good explanations and doesn't give tricky questions during tests. Your grade is based only on midterm and final(cumul), which sucks. However prof M. curves them a bit. You Have to come to classes to understand the subject unless you r really goos at studying yrlf</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2009<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor McCarthy is one of the best teachers in the MBA program.

Accounting is awful, and he pretty much admits up front that he knows none of us care about the subject and won't be accountants, so he doesn't try to shove a bunch of CPA stuff down your throat.  He was super nice and really helpful.  The tests are hard, but he curves generously.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2009<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty good teacher.

It's not that bad.  McCarthy only tests on material he talks about in class.  If you attend, and do the minimal ammount of HW you should do just fine. Also, he has a generous grading scale</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2003<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard exams, but good at explaining/teaching!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2003<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny guy to listen to in class.
