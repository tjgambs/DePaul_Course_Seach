He knows exactly what he is talking about. Class grade is determined on papers, but he allows a great amount of range when writing them. He is very helpful, and class was very enjoyable.

This Prof. is great! I had him a while back and if you do the reading (Yes, it's quite a bit but interesting material that makes you use your brain)and go to class, you will be fine.

The reading is actually rather interesting. If you do the reading, go to class, and put a little effort, you have to be an idiot not to get an A. Plus, he is HOT. Very good teacher, but you need to earn your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good professor.  His class requires a lot of reading, but it's fairly interesting material (if you're into philosophy). Beware, he is a stickler for grammar! He's also quite attractive...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am taking 4 classes and by far, I got the most out of this one. it wasn't very appealing at first, but he made it very interesting. he knows how to teach and cracks jokes that will make you laugh. when it comes to grading, he is really strict on midterms and finals.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow---extremly hard grader for a core req. class.

Bland readings.  VERY VERY REPETITIVE. He explains material well, but with him repeating everything the class becomes unbareable.  I thought I enjoyed philosophy B4 his class, but I dislike it now.

You will learn a lot, if you go into this class with an open mind.  Just 2 papers, and a few quizzes and short writing assignments.  He wants to help you grasp the concepts, which makes the learning experience better.Overall a good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If anything is boring, its the class, but he tries to explain everything. Only like 3 or 4 quizzes and essays. Two big papers, mid & final. Just write everything he said in class. Take good notes! Take him in small doses, MWF.

Drink coffee and eat breakfast if you have an early class-you really have a hard time staying awake. He tries really hard to make it so you can connect to the material, which is nice.

Nice guy, but common...these guys are dead, not that exciting !</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he explains the material very thoroughly.  i didn't read one thing in that class, but i did well on my papers because i took really good notes.  just make sure you go to class and take notes.  he may seem boring, but it's because the subject's boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor. I like him a lot. He's not too boring(although philosophy is a boring subject). He is willing to explain everything and can be funny too once in a while. Overall I would take him again,he's really cool!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2004<br>Class Name: MGTETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yeah, like all the other comments say, he's cute...but at the HUGE expense of being among the most boring lecturers I've ever had. He assigns 2 big papers and they're rather hard to write. Grades hard. When you write a paper, write what he wants 2 hear.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>every lecture and reading hardly made sense, but if you take notes of everything he writes and the board and elaborate on them for your papers you will do just fine. Participation helps also.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So cute! It made class worth going to. EVen though philospohy is boring as**** anyways. He looks kinda like Rivers Cuomo from Weezer....</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>After weeks of long incomprehensible lectures and readings, he assigns VERY LONG PAPERS as midterms and finals on EXTREMELY VAGUE topics that are IMPOSSIBLE to write about.  STAY AWAY - STAY FAR AWAY</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2004<br>Class Name: PHI234<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes a nice guy but this is the worst class ive ever taken at depaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2004<br>Class Name: PHL234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is by far the worst teacher out there. He's willing to help you but no one understands. A goldfish could teach this course better than he could.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: PHL234<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He never explains anything. Don't expect to be able to understand him or his ideas. The reading assignments were impossible to comprehend and when the entire class decided to confront him on this he didnt make much of an effor to explain the material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class can be a little boring when he just talks the whole time, but if you participate he'll really like you. Very helpful with papers (and there are only two!).  He'll give you feedback and tell you what you need to get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher.  Goes off on tangents every now and then.  2 main papers.  Helps alot in revising them.  Overall, he's a kewl guy.  HE'S HOT!!..hahaha..^_^</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a little confusing, but he is willing to stay after class and talk to you.  Class lectures can be a bit boring, but if you participate, he'll like you a lot.  Not that bad of a teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2004<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First off, he's a real bohemian and incredibly attractive...though his favorite color is black.  There really isn't a lot of discussion going on, mostly just him and his thoughts...which can be very unclear sometimes...but I liked the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2004<br>Class Name: PHL234<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a very hard time explaining his abstract ideas to the class.  Also, if you need to take good notes in order to study, don't expect him to help you.  He almost doesn't ever write anything down on the board that you can use for notes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good guy, participate in class and he'll like you. easy quizes if you do the reading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2004<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy has no idea what hes talking about. if a student asks a question he will answer it by asking the rest of the class 'what do you think' because he never has an answer or even opinions to offer. i wouldnt recommend him for philosophy but he is hot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2003<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2003<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
