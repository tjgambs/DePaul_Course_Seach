			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

Expect to get out 15-40 minutes early. Book isn't useful, but necessary for briefs. BUY THE STUDY GUIDE. It is just like the 2 exams.

His discussions keep you interested the whole time and I love his sense of humor! He relates everything to real life, so nothing seems abstract!

He's AMAZING.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: BWL201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>this professor is my favorite!!!

He doesn't take attendance but he does outline the most important stuff for the tests so you might as well go. Plus he jokes around a lot and lets you out early. The only way you don't get an A or B is if you absolutely don't even try a little. He's really nice and isn't out to screw up people's GPAs. PS Get the study guide.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.
