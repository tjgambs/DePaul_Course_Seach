Made the course interesting. A good class to take, not much pressure, actually a class I liked showing up for.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2012<br>Class Name: SOC212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very sweet and knowledgable lady, but kind of a boring class. Don't buy the book, you don't need it. Midterm multiple choice test which is curved. Final essay (easy) paper and final (easy) project. A common sense class, take if you're looking for an easy elective.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2012<br>Class Name: SOC390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just show up to class, participate fully, and do your work. You will be rewarded with an A as long as you do all that. Plus, the work she will ask you to do isn't hard at all. I'm not sure why you say she should retire. What an awful thing to say about such a nice, intelligent professor. I think she's a very nice person and enjoyed her class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2012<br>Class Name: SOC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY sweet lady, mandatory attendance, midterm & final for which you must study for. Very knowledgable and approachable. :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2012<br>Class Name: SOC400<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She will always take attendance, I didnt attend for about half the quarter as well and she lowered me grade bc of that!!!! She also tends to be picky at times with papers, unpredictable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: SOC395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Complete BIRD COURSE. I've taken her 3 times and I miss half of the quarter and still get A's. She's super boring but super easy and that's exactly what I'm looking for as a senior who is just ready to graduate and be done. Take her if you have a heavy course load and want to relax a little for one of your classes. She's very knowledgeable though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2011<br>Class Name: SOC348<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Why should she retire&#63; She is sharp as a tack even thought she is very old. Ask her anything and she can answer. Very organized and creative. City of the future&#63; that class was unique, I learned a lot in the research projects. You make the class what you want it to be. If you want it to be fun then it will be. Very good sense of humor as well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: SOC348<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love professor Sween had her multiple times, she's a sweet lady but I think its time for her to retire. Class is not really mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2007<br>Class Name: SOC395<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is a classic example of why tenure can be bad. She needs to retire. Class felt like share time with grandma. Lectures were about nothing and the class was incredibly vague and boring. Yes she is easy, but unless you have to take her you really shouldn't. She made a senior class feel like we were in middle school with the work assigned.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: SOC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Taken many classes with Dr. Sween, intelligent lady with lots of patience to help students. Easy grader as long as you do the work, attendance is not a main concern to her but all work must be submitted on time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: SOC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a sweet lady!! I love her. As said before, she lets out about 45 minutes early every class. No hw. The way she teaches is a bit boring but easy A. Definitely taker her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2006<br>Class Name: SOC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice old lady i never showed up to the class but still manage to get B+ attendence, one class assignment, midterm, final project and take home final very easy..take her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2005<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: COMSOCIETY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i LOVE her! A sweet old women who means well. I took it as a night class- NEVER stayed later than 7:30! a 30 question mult. choice midterm (AND CURVED- super easy!!) group project- simple, and a take home final.   Great lady, highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2004<br>Class Name: SOC392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tells you exactly what she wants, didn't change the syllabus at all. Nice person, too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2004<br>Class Name: SOC105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was really easy.  She lectures and then lets out about 45 minutes early EVERY CLASS! As was said before, The final is a take home and all you have other than that is a project...take her class...ITS EASY! Most of the class naps the entire time</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2004<br>Class Name: SOC105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hilarious. So old and senile. Class would get out 30-40 minutes early every time. Easy class, but the mult. choice midterm needs to be studied for. If you like sleeping, no homework, and getting A's...take this class. You may need a case of Red Bull.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2004<br>Class Name: SOC105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is interesting but the way she teaches will put you to sleep. Does not ask for ANY participation and half the class takes a nap or doodles. She sits during her entire lecture behind a desk (health reasons). Sweet and means well but soooo boring.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
