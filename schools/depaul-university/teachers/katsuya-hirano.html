Kats is a very approachable and smart professor. He gives reasonable amount of reading and assignment. I received A. I wonder students giving Kats bad rating did not do well in his class. Kats was among the best.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2006<br>Class Name: HST230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very interesting class on premodern Japan. His lecture is very well organized and intereting. It gives you a lot of new and interesting perspectives on Japan and history in general. It's too bad that he is leaving DePaul for Cornell after this year.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2006<br>Class Name: HIS231<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this man's arrogance is only bested by his ignorance. He has very little true knowledge of his subject and is about as interesting as watching paint dry. He is also a poor grader and judge of charater</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2005<br>Class Name: HST287<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Hirano was a very passionite, very interesting professor. His class was meant to over history of East Asia since 1600. I was a bit disapointed that that it only focused on late 19th and 20th century history of Japan and China. In any case though, Kats is a great professor and I'd highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: HST231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The man in general is genius.  He gives realistic assignments (as stated), understands how students work, makes his lectures interesting, gives good material (though a lot of reading) and is responsive if help is needed.  Not much focus on the wars, but more on the inherent struggles and problems of Modern Japan.  Take this course.  Kats owns.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2005<br>Class Name: HST231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: HST231<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SMOKING HOT!!! After ur able to get over his gorgeous looks, u'll learn that this is a rather easy class. 3 papers that are pretty easy as long as you take some good notes and he's a very generous grader. NO MIDTERM. NO FINAL EXAM. Only downfall is alot of note-taking. Participation encouraged, but not required.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: HST231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's a really good teacher and not a very hard grader. just takes notes and you'll be fine. you dont even really need to do the readings.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: HIS322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most inspiring professor I ever had at DePaul. Truly intelligent, thoughtful, and knowledgeable. Readings and class discussions are not easy, but if you want to really learn, Kats is the one I strongly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kats is the greatest.  I had so much fun in this class.  Kats is really funny.  I felt like I learned a lot and it was still an easy class to pass.  Highly Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2005<br>Class Name: HST231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh, I loved this class. Proff Katz is awesome. Interesting lectures. Only three 2-page essays and that's it.

Take-home midterm and final, both a breeze. Bring a snack to class to keep yourself entertained. Lectures can be a little boring but take the notes cuz you'll need em for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2005<br>Class Name: HST231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really cool.  Not at all what I expected from a history class.  You learn concepts and theories instead of names, dates, and places.  He is not a hard grader but paper topics can be kind of hard to write about but no tests!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: HST287<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've never been so bored in class before, except during discussion days, those were good - hes a good teacher and a nice guy, but the class is a little bit boring, well a lot bit actually - not much else to say - oh yeah, EASY grader, EASY class, but boring</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: HST287<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very manageable class. Just do the reading and make sure you show up for discussion. His english is excellent for being foreign born, and was not an issue whatsoever. A very realistic professor, only 2 papers and participation were our grade. Do the reading (quite a bit), and it'll be worth your time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: HON103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a very understanding guy, down to earth and intelligent. i really enjoyed being in his class, enough to say that he is definately one of my favorite teachers at depaul. attendance is required but take my word and pretty much everyone elses rating Kats, you'll like to be in class anyway.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: HON103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy was amazing.  He will definitely go down as one of my favorite teachers at depaul.  he was very engaging and intelligent, very clear and helpful about what he wanted to see in papers and in class.  I cannot say enough nice things about this man, because he was just great!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: HST231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Can't recommend this teacher enough. Absolutely fantastic on every front. Lots of required reading and class attendance is a huge part of the grade, but his lectures are engaging and he's a very nice guy. It also helps that material is engaging. Three papers, take home final, no surprises.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kats is a wonderful professor!  Yes his class requires that you read, but there were only three short papers, no midterm and no final.  Kats is funny at times and makes class interesting, the only thing that he asks is that you read the material.  I strongly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: HST230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy. Classes and reading can get boring. Take-home midterm and final. Course reader $15 on top of 4 or 5 books. Overall, pretty easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2005<br>Class Name: HON103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is great! I've never had any sort of problems with him-- he's intelligent, patient, funny, and a great character.  I highly reccommend him for a teacher, he's awesome!  His english is also impeccable, and I always look forward to going to his class.  I feel bad if I miss it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: HST231<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!  Class involved lots of reading but  only two papers and those were for the midterm and final.  He definatly knows what he is talking about and is a fair grader.  I got an A on my midterm and final.  I would highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: HST231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Speaks English very well and is very intelligent.  He knows what he is talking about and there is no test, just two papers determine your grade and he is fairly easy grader.  Alot of reading, but it is also pretyt interesting reading.  I got a B+, but I missed alot of class(it was at 8:30am). Get hi</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2004<br>Class Name: HIS231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really a cool guy. As foreign professors go, his English is impeccable! I had little to no trouble understanding him at any time. Kats is very intelligent, and he expects students to do their work. I got a B+ on my midterm, and I think it was a fair grade. He's a good professor. Get him if you can!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
