Very nice and helpful professor. Take him over any accounting professor at Depaul. All other accounting professors are too serious and think they know it all. Not helpful at all. Wendorf is one of these, she thinks she knows it all and is not helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely funny and great professor.

He wants you to do well, cares about his students.  If you go to class and pay attention you can do pretty well.

Midterm was harder than expected and he makes you write a paper comparing annual reports. You should attend every class so you don't fall behind because his tests seem to cover everything in class.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
