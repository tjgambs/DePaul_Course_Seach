He is the first professor who makes a difficult course easy. You must work though to achieve the grade A, simply you need to spend couple of hours outside the class and practice. No difficulty on midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor I've had at DePaul.

I was experiencing many technical difficulties with MyMathLab, and he was there every step of the way to help me with it. Also, if you ever need a homework/quiz extension, he will give it to you as long as you are a good student.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2011<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simple the best math teacher at DePaul.
