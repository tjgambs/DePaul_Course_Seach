Treats you like a child; gives you busy work.  You have to turn in your NOTES to get graded.  Going to this class literally made my head hurt.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2006<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a great teacher, and was very funny. She made the material be not as boring as it could have been. Be ready to participate though. She's really nice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked her, she was so nice, and helpful.I did very well in her class and she got me intrested in the subject. TAke her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2006<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's an easy teacher...she wanted us to learn the greek alphabet and we asked her if we could learn it for extra credit and she agreed. She's cool, not a hard class at all...no tests all papers and no final or midterm :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the easiest class i ever took...yeah she is boring as hell but she gives you extra credit for no reason.  I did the bare minimum and walked into the final with 40 extra points.  Needless to say that got well over an A.  TAKE HER</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class sucks. She READS her lecture notes, questions make no sense, and yes she is way too serious. I'd rather work 8 hours than sit in her class for an hour and a half (feels like you're in class for a day).  She gives way too much reading which by the way is hard to understand. Worst teacher...Avoid her at all costs!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: PHI101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher was way too interested in the sound of her own voice.  I dont think she even understood half the stuff she was saying and most of it was B.S.  She talked to us like we were 4th graders.  Take this class if you want to be bored out of your mind.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know, she might be a good teacher, but I guess I'm not good in philosophy. She's pretty hard, expects attendance, and her papers are tough if you don't know/care about philosophy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2004<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is da bomb. After class we would smoke a fat bowl in her office and chat the time away comparing and contrasting various philosophers. Take this class if you wanna get high!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was the worst teacher i have had at depaul, im a senior so i think thats saying a lot.  her class is extreemly easy but she is so boring.  ill tell u that the hour u r with her goes by slower than any class.  she takes it to serious and is not fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is ok, she takes it very serious.  Quiz everyday and attendance is important.  Two 8 pages papers make up most of your final grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, I wouldn't say she is the best teacher.  She often goes off into tangets, however she is as nice as they come.  She was helpful and not too hard.  Quizzes every class...so easy though! The readings are interesting too!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>anyone who failed her class must have been frequently absent or brain dead.. this class was pretty easy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an extremely nice professor and an easy grader. There are quizzes every day but she gives many opportunities for extra credit. The material and class sessions are VERY boring, but its an easy way to fulfill a PHL requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the worst teacher i've had at depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: PHIL101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough class.  Quizzes everyday!  She is a neat lady, but not a fun teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nancy isn't a bad teacher at all.  She's a little vague sometimes and kind of a rough grader on essays, but her quizzes actually make getting a decent grade a little easier.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>terrible! basically what was previously said, she reads off of a bunch of note cards and has no idea what she is talking about. i would not recommend having her as a professor otherwise you WILL have the worst quarter!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2003<br>Class Name: 101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor, good class.  She will provide extra help if you if you don't understand something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2003<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2003<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>McPike has a great grasp on the material, is very helpful, and very kind.

Paper assignments are very vague, and hard to understand exactly what she wants from them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2003<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough class. She seems like a cool person, but as a teacher...I dunno. She's really tough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2003<br>Class Name: 100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady but has no business teaching Philosophy.  Reads off a note card and seems to have trouble answering arbitrary but relavent questions considering her lecture material.  Became hard to sit in class.  Pathetic is a better word for it.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
