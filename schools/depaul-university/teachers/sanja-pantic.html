I didn't mind her accent, it made me pay attention. It was a lot more of a college class than a high school class. I actually came out of the class more interested in math than when I went in.  I liked how she used the internet and technology.Four Stars.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2011<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice woman and wants to help but her help is useless. She usually solves the problems wrong and is hard to understand because of her accent. This is basically an online class where you teach yourself. You can use your cellphone and laptops all throughout class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2011<br>Class Name: MATH101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a good class if you have a lot of self discipline. The class itself has absolutely no structure. It's basically her assigning an entire coursework of homework with a due date at the end of the quarter. She'll implement some sort of deadline once in a while without telling you, but it's not enough to add structure to the class.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
