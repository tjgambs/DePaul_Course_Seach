Works with you and is a fair grader. I took this class over the summer and really enjoyed it. Do the work, participate in class and you'll get an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2013<br>Class Name: ACC375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is very interesting and passionate about the field. The grade is based off of inclass cases a team presentation and a final exam. I wouldn't say the material is overly complicated just FULL effort in for the cases and the project and you should get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2013<br>Class Name: ACC375<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Shelton is a little unorganized, but overall she is a good professor. I took the ACC 375 over the December Session, which met five times. Grade was base off in class case studies, a presentation, and the final. I recommend this course for those who are doing the internal audit concentration.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2013<br>Class Name: ACC375<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>3 case studies worth 40% of grade, a "shamefully easy" final worth 35%, 20% group project, 5% participation grade. This intersession class is a good one. I got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you do not plan on reading the book and taking good notes, do not plan on doing well in this class. The subject matter is difficult but bearable. Professor Shelton does a good job of explaining each chapter and her tests are fair and everything is expected. Come to class, read and put effort in group projects and anyone can get at least a B</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2013<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor. Very unorganized. Unclear. Boring. Overall terrible. Her Midterm was hard and she claims her Final to be easier...was just as hard if not harder. She knows what she is talking about and worked in the field...just terrible at teaching. She expected you to know EVERYTHING, even if she didn't teach it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: ACC547<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher is super cool. But one word for this class is unorganized. Good luck learning anything. But you are required to know the book and her notes. I really wanted to learn for the CPA but i guess ill be learning on my own. The class is a circus. Grading is very hard and i put alot of effort for min return. Take someone else if you want to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2012<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good Professor. Although she knows her stuff, she doesn't know how to make her lectures interesting and understandable. Tests are hard and she grades everything harshly. Wouldn't recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2012<br>Class Name: ACC376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the internal auditing class during the winter break and it was the easiest accounting class by far. She changed her teaching style due to the negative ratings and now the class is super easy. We had 1 exam w/ 40 questions and all the questions were from her powerpoint. We were done with the final in 15 mins. The topic is interesting too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2011<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher! She is soooo lazy and doesn't lecture in class. Projects are easy but her test are very hard. The only reason why they are hard is because she doesn't go over what is on the test. Makes herself not available to talk to. her email responses are one line long!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2011<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take her. She is very disorganized and lazy. She grades the papers by the end of the semester so you dont know your grade until the end. They syllabus is outdated. D2L has lot of stuff posted that we didn't use during the coure. She did not review anything before the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2011<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great lady, Great Teacher! Exam is pretty tough and she grades it pretty hard. So don't be fooled by how laid back the course is. Will learn a lot if you just pay attention. Didn't buy the book but plan on getting an B if not an A!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2010<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hmmm the yellow faces must be written by the prof herself... she fell asleep through presentations, made you feel like a bother if you saw her after class... and was completely disorganized. You will not walk out CPA ready... and the case studies were a waste of time... truly shocked she is a prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT547<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Instructor is professional since she has long-term working experiences and doctoral education in Accounting. The videos and cases that instructor showed us helped us to understand and remember all the Auditing detailed information easily. Because the Dean of DePaul wrote the text book by focusing on the CPA exam, every single page is essential.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: ACC547<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very poor class. Wish it was offered with another professor.   She showed up late every class and was not prepared.  It was clear that the class was not her priority.  If possible avoid taking classes with her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was ok... very interesting material, though too much at some points and a little bit chaotic and disorganized! Other than that I would take another class with her, very nice lady!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this class!  She is a great teacher and very knowledgable in the subject.  I would definitely take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2007<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>going to class isnt necessary, the tests are tricky, i wouldnt bother with the textbook, just use the website for it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2007<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She reads straight from powerpoints provided by the book's publisher.  Attending class is a complete waste of time.  Do NOT buy the iclicker, used once in class for &quot;fun&quot; then never used again.  However, even thought she is a terrible teacher who does as little work as possible, you REALLY have to try to fail her class, it is almost impossible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2007<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shelton made me lose all confidence in DePaul as an institution. Straight A student, I got a D+ on the MT after studying all material thoroughly. You WILL NOT learn anything valuable. Don't buy the iClicker, textbook useful to a degree, class presentations only allow her to teach less. Doesn't care about her students at all. Should be fired.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2007<br>Class Name: ACC547<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class; you will only learn the basics. She makes you buy this iClicker to take &quot;quizzes&quot; in class. Used maybe 3 times. Supposedly they count towards the participation grade but I doubt it. There are two pretty easy exams, one small group presentation, and one group paper.  Presentation and paper graded very leniently. She is always late.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2007<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whatever professor makes students purchase $250 worth of text for the class, needs to learn to material themselves.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2006<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a terrible class. She really does come at least 15 min late every single week. She only has 5 chapters to teach so you take the midterm and then she makes up really stupid assignments for the last few weeks. the final was a joke, I finished in under 15 min. Don't ever ask her questions, its not worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2006<br>Class Name: ACC547<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you take her at the grad level, you'll find she's very easy & equally ill-equipped to teach the class.  She brought very little to class (bad redundant lectures, silly assignments & no insight.)  So far, its been my worst class @ depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2006<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shows up 15-20 min late to every...single....class.  It was VERY annoying since you are paying a lot of money to take her class.  The class is really pointless.  You cover absolutely no relevant and useful material.  The only useful thing you do is a big project which just forces you to go back and read your ACC 101 book through again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2006<br>Class Name: ACC<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shows up 20 minutes late for EVERY class and doesn't seem to care about anything. on the plus side it is really easy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2006<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most knowledgable professors at DePaul.  She really has a passion for the auditing profession.  If you read the text, go to class and study a few of hours a week you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2006<br>Class Name: ACC398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice lady. This class is very easy. You get out early all the time. It is not her fault though, I don't think you can talk abut Fraud for hours at a time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2005<br>Class Name: ACCOUNTING<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You might as well be teaching yourself.  She spends most of the class time looking at the clock, wanting to get out of there.  And she's always late.  Although, it is easy to get a good grade in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2005<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy and laid back professor. easiest class ever. pick a nice group since the whole class is group based.  for midterm and finals go over quizzes. u dont need book to for exams.  easy A class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's easy and laid back. don't expect to learn anything new in this ACC class cuz all the material relates to your first retail job. seriously straightforward stuff. make sure you have a good group cuz most of assigns are done in group.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>yeah she is always late, but she is really nice and she is very EASY grader. Just study the quizzes for the exams, no need to study from the book. Make sure that you are in a good group for the SUA project, otherwise you'll get stuck doing the packet alone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Disorganized but easy. If you need to take this class, this is the teacher to take. You will definitely pass with an 'A'.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2005<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She fell asleep during a presentation.  Not a good class if you want to get an academic foundation in audit.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most unorganized person ever. I had no idea what we were doing. In class quizzes are the midterm and final. No surprises there. I wouldn't take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: ACC547<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shelton is a very nice lady. I think the projects eat up too much of class time though. Read the book, do the quizes online, and go through the slides and you'll be fine. Also, show up to class, I think she puts a lot more weight into participation than the syllabus says.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Disorganized and always late, but she grades relatively easy.  She gives study guides for exams and sticks to that for the exam, so you really don't have any surprises on the exam.  You will learn as much as you are willing to teach yourself, b/c it won't be coming from her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2005<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is perhaps the lamest class I've had required of me. Shelton doesn't really teach anything; she zooms through the material, explains nothing, and then assigns random projects that aren't on the syllabus. Thanks DePaul for yet another Dr. of business who can't teach.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most disorganized horrible teacher i have ever had! I was in the summer class also and she was late to every class(if she even showed up!) She taught for about a half hour and bullsh@$ed the rest and cancelled the last 2 wks!If you plan on taking more acct courses dont take her-u wont learn anyt</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2004<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I also had her for summer school and she sucks. She never made it to class on time and never offered any apology or explanations. She doesn't teach anything and is very unorganized. Too lazy to even grade her own scantron tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2004<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is lazy, a waste of time and a waste of money. We only met about 4-5 times during the five weeks of sum. school. She was about 45 min. late to every class and is very unorganized. Learned absolutley nothing in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2004<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I concur with the other negative posts, she was late to class all but on meeting not including the final...her cell phone went off numerous times during class...and get this...she actually answered it once or twice, no sh%t. She could be good..but isn't.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2004<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably was in the same class as the other two posts.

We all wondered whether she got the clas starting time mixed up.  It's a good thing i learned something from the project.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2003<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awsome teacher best one i have ever had</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2003<br>Class Name: ACC100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWSOME TEACHER...VERY HELPFULL,TAKE HOME FINAL VERY FUN, SHOW UP TO CLASS AND YOU WILL DO FINE</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2003<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very cool teacher,tests are easy...as long as you show up to class, you will be fine.
