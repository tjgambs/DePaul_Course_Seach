He is not a difficult grader and his expectations are very low, but expect to have lots of reading and writing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2008<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While I don't think he is the worst teacher in the world, I don't think he is the best either. If you have no real experience in education, he will paint this very naive picture of teaching that I didn't particularly like very much. However, the class is engaging and if he likes you he will constantly call on you. He was very run of the mill for me</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2008<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Mims is an extraordinary person and is so incredibly inspiring.  Class discussed the profession and potential of education.  Practical knowledge and political knowledge.  Wonderful resource!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2007<br>Class Name: TL424<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Mims relates most class discussions to his experience at Lane Tech which I found helpful and interesting.  The class is pretty easy but makes you think about your future as a teacher.  He is very interested in what the class thinks and remembers what each student wrote in their papers every week!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2007<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mims relates everything about teaching back to Lane Tech, or whatever high school he once taught at.  He is really nice, intelligent, and dicussions are usually interesting.  Easy class - didn't leart too much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice person, but a boring professor! We discussed readings and read papers. I didn't learn anything. It was too easy. Show up, do the little bit of work that's assigned, and you're bound to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2007<br>Class Name: TL401<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mims is the best. He has real experience teaching, knows how to teach classroom management, and is extremely supportive! If you're a student that wants to learn how to teach from a brilliant real deal teacher, not the ivory tower, Mims is your man.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2006<br>Class Name: SEC325<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not helpful in the least.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2005<br>Class Name: TL429<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2004<br>Class Name: ED405<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mims is an adjunct (high school teacher by day), but he is better than most of the tenured professors at DePaul. Try to get in to his class if you can, it's fun and the class has a good vibe with applicable work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2004<br>Class Name: ENG243<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mims</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
