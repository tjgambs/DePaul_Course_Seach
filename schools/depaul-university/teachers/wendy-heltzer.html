No homework, just a midterm and final. She gives you previous exams to study from and the exams are almost identical to past exams and problems from class.

Show up to class, follow her lecture packets, and do the hw. No textbook or access code needed. The hw is just like the class problems. She is the best accounting professor ever!

Never tries to trick you. No homework, just midterm and final. Gives you past exams to study from. She goes over things quickly and we often got out of class early, but you learn a lot and she goes through a ton of examples. Her note packets make the material easy to understand.

Her way of teaching is superb. She has practice finals/midterms on blackboard which are an exact replica of the official final/midterm you will take. The practice tests tell you how to solve every problem so for the real test you just go and follow exact format. If you get less than an A on her tests, change majors.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BY FAR THE BEST PROFESSOR OUT THERE!! If you have had to retake this course take this teacher, she is super easy and explains everything. She even gives you hints on what the midterm and final will be like.

Midterm + Final. She doesn't check attendance so you get 5% FREE to your grade basically (If you don't show up to class and are majoring in ACC you are an idiot.)
