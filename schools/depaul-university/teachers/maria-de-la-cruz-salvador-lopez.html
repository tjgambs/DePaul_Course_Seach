Usually you discuss it in class. If you don't participate in the discussion she'll quiz you on the reading to make sure you did it. She helps clarify the readings in class, take notes. Assignments are critical analysis on readings</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2015<br>Class Name: PHL240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Maria is awesome. She is very passionate about philosophy and knows her stuff. I can get a little repetitive at times, but that comes with the territory.  She gives great feedback before a paper is due and gives the opportunity to make edits after you get the paper back.  She's also just cool to sit and talk with, very interesting individual. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2015<br>Class Name: PHL243<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Salvador I would recommend to anyone who needs a Philosophy requirement but finds the subject challenging or somewhat uninteresting. This is because she explains everything so well and makes it engaging at the same time. There's no textbook--she provides the texts for readings. Great teacher, extremely knowledgeable and easy-going.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2015<br>Class Name: PHL243<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, she is very knowledgable about the subject (very impressive) and cares about it, as well as cares about that we all understand it. Sometimes the lectures get long and sound repetitive, but that is Philosophy. It was also sometimes hard to get your hands on the films to watch, but the selection of the movies was good. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is amazing! I took her for two classes and both times I received an A. She expects participation but as long as you raise your hand every once in a while you'll be sure to get participation points. She gives good feedback on papers and does not grade hard at all! No quizzes or tests only papers for midterm and final. Def recommend. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2014<br>Class Name: 100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Maria is great. She gives you plenty of opportunities to ask questions and will look over your papers as often as you like before they're due. She gives great feedback and makes the texts interesting. I switched to a philosophy major after this class! </div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
