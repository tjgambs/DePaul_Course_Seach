	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Buy Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />

Do the readings and attend class and you will be fine. This class is an easy B..a tough A but it's possible. You need to be a good writer. I'd suggest showing him your paper before turning it in. The class is all discussion and it was interesting hearing several points of view. One of the best professors at DPU.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2011<br>Class Name: AMS250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, cool teacher, class is pretty interesting. Readings are ok but...DO NOT TAKE CLASS IF YOU AREN'T A GOOD WRITER/ANALYZER. Review is not for all students. I ended up with a c+ while busting my a** off on papers. U also dont get a good understanding on where ur at grading wise during course. Hands back graded papers based on check,plus, or minus</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2010<br>Class Name: AMS150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class....lots of discussion....about three informals and two formal papers.

If you have the chance to take him do it. You talk about hot button issues and he always encourages class discussion. Fairly easy grader as long as you can state on opinion and back it up.

He is very helpful and most importantly he makes the class interesting and worth coming to. Other than analyzing a few essays, there are also a few quizzes on some of the readings assigned. After the quiz he goes over the readings to make sure you understood them. I would take him again if I could!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2007<br>Class Name: AMS150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very helpful and explains things well. papers need to be very analytical but other than that class is pretty easy and it is very interesting. definitely a great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2007<br>Class Name: AMS150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was hard, but it was interesting.

He's laid back but his classes aren't blow-off's. Would definitely reccomend.

Great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2006<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Quirk! His classes are always fun and his assignments are usually pretty interesting and he is a fair grader if you put in the effort.  He doesn't play favorites- he just likes people who contribute to class discussion like a good college student should.  Quirk's classes are fairly stress free and fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh my god!!! This class was the biggest lamest waste of my time. He does play favorites like you wouldnt believe and he doesnt really teach anything he just talks and talks about previous readings but he expects you to already understand.

I know I didnt</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice man. He turely wants his student's writings to improve. He might come off as a little tough, but he just wants people to do their best. If you do your work to the best of your ablity you should do well.
