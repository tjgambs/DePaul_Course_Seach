However all papers had the option to be done in groups of 4 which made her 5 page papers easier. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2015<br>Class Name: MGT357<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>No tests but a lot of writing involved. If you have a good group, this class will be pretty easy. The papers can either be individual or group work. The lectures are boring and drag. She sometimes will make you work with a group in-class to discuss issues. Her participation grading is odd though. I would still recommend to get this gen-ed out. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2015<br>Class Name: MGT357<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy quizzes and discussions. No midterm and final.  She made good online lectures, but she is not organized. She posts wrong information for the HWs and corrects it without any announcement. Check out D2L as often as possible. She may be good at lecturing, but she is not a good listener. It is a EASY CLASS, but annoying. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2014<br>Class Name: MGT357<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Spent the entire quarter listening to her stories and viewing power point slides. Only a few assignments throughout the class. Show up and stay awake and you will do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: MGT357<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>She uses powerpoints the entire class with some poorly implemented group discussions. She expects everyone to participate but doesn't do anything to simulate interest in the course. Case study midterm, final group paper, a few online assignments along the way. The work wasn't difficult, but the material is so dry. I expected more.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: MGT357<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Her lectures are kinda boring but overall she is really good. No final. Just a group paper. A MUST TAKE CLASS.Work  hard and u will surely get an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: MGT357<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great deal of work, readings, papers, all due at beginning of each class. Participation required, midterm covers 6 chapters from book, final project presentation has to be 20minutes long, and final exam is just ridiculous. Put in work and you should be okay.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
