At first it was immensely easy and immensely boring! He knows what he is talking about but he can't teach for beans! If you are on his good side you will get an A. I happened to have pissed him off and although I got an A on every assignment I got a B in the class. I would never take him again..EVER</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: MUSIVI<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oooooooh Campo. . .he knows so much, if only he could share some of it with his students. I didn't have too much trouble with grades as quizzes were really rather easy, but discussions were nothing short of torture for the most part.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2006<br>Class Name: MUS230<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bad teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2006<br>Class Name: MUS6<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows the subject, too bad he doesn't know how to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2005<br>Class Name: MUSICIANSHIP<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool guy. Knows what he's talking about, just doesnt know how to explain it.  Again, great guy, just bad teacher.  It seems he learned academese before english.  This hasnt helped the clarification process of the many arbitrary/ambiguous questions that he often askes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: MUS220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well. He brings recordings to class and doesn't know who's playing, the worst recordings you've ever heard as well. He has more work in his class than both other musicianship classes combined, and it's impossibly hard. Take his class and expect 4 quizes, 1 midterm, 1 final, 2 papers, random homework, and 1 presentation PER QUARTER!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2005<br>Class Name: MUS220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Juan is cool. DOnt be a dumbass. Do your homeworks. Know your theory.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2005<br>Class Name: VARIOUS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very tough teacher, but it's because he challenges you to bring your compositional or musicianship thinking to a whole higher level.  Having him as a teacher is a respect/hate relationship.  And a year afterwards, you'll be glad you had him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2005<br>Class Name: MUSICIANSHIP<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Day one of this class, Juan blew me away. He is filled with brilliant ideas and approaches to teaching, coaxing the mind to think more creatively and abstractly.  Though, there have been issues of a lacking structural approach to teaching material. I believe if he is given a chance, he can go far.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
