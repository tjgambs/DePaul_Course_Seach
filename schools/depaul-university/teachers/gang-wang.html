If you actually care about probability theory and statistics, you have nothing to worry about. Take him. He just wants to see dedication, hard work, and interest. You'll have to go to every lecture, read each chapter of the book, and even do the even problems, but afterwards, you'll be a probability wizard. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: CALC2<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is extremely intelligent however I do not think his personality is suited for teaching.

So what if his accent is some times challenging to understand, he still makes sense of every piece of information that's given. MathLab is his teaching mechanism. Very helpful and thorough; makes sure every student individually understands every topic.

In the first class he goes over some materials that everybody should knwo and he suggests dropping the class if what he covered is too tough for you and he's right. The guy really knows Math, and knows how to explain it really well, you just need to study and do the homework.  Good luck</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2005<br>Class Name: MAT150151<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is horrible. i had to drop the class TWICE. depaul needs more calculus teachers to pick from.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: MAT351<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the toughest professor I've had at DePaul, but it made getting a B+ in his class all the better.

Without huge extra credit I would get an C in his class. He's funny at times, but that doesn't matter much when your grade is endangered.

I failed a math class for the first time in my life with this teacher.  I am taking the grad. level Mat451 and am passing with an A !!!!  Do not take this teacher if you want to pass.

If you can pay attention well, he is great because it's an easy class. But if you have trouble with accents and you need lots of help you might struggle. Basically, he isn't as bad as everyone says.
