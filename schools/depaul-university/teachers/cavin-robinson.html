Very vague. he's one of those people that likes to make you think he knows everything. he probably became a teacher to feel smart.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2008<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is not a business ethics class. Do not take it for business ethics, it is a political theory class. Teacher is pretty good swears all the time but its cool he's only 28. Mostly I think that he is teaching his PhD dissertation. He will teach you a lot about what the U.S. is about.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2008<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like everything sugar coated do not take him. But if you want to actually really want to learn something in all of its truth and honesty then take him. The work is really not that difficult, and he makes understanding PHL really easy. He?s an excellent teacher, who actually cares about his students, and there education. I give him mad props.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2008<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher. Never returned emails. Didn't return  grades until quarter was nearly over. If he didn't know the answer he would make it up (US still on the gold standard&#63; I don't think so!). Claimed to encourage discussion but talked down to students and shot down ideas that differed from his. I did not feel comfortable contributing in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2008<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Robinson is a great professor. I kind of regret taking his class so early in the morning, but overall it was a great class. I took alot away from this class, and he is a very respectable and help to his students.

He is soo helpful and really smart. He knows what he's talking about and he expects u to participate so that you can fully understand wat he wants and doesn't want. Very concise and helpful. He is encouraging and fun. Good sense of humor , a little sarcastic, and aggressive but it makes u learn and appreciate the subject..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2007<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Know a few things going into his class. 1- attendance is mandatory. 2- he is one of the most intelligent and innovative professors I've had. 3- He doesn't tell; he teaches 4- Any negative comments towards Cavin for &quot;not listening to students ideas&quot; are inaccurate. He basis his class on logical argument-so don't speak without thinking. Great Class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2007<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Read the material and pay attention to his lectures; I took a M-W day class, so it was much more interesting than a night class.

First, I got a good grade in his class so don't think im bashing cause of my grade. Second he thinks his ideas are the only right ones, does not know how to present material, does not respect others students' ideas. He should start teaching high school students first and get experience. Don't take this guy he stinks!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2006<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a pretty cool professor, who explains everything and he doesn't try to trick you.

He will explain eveyrhting so thoroughly that it is hard to mess up on the papers. The readings are not extensive, but complex. He can spark a very good discussion although he has set points of view he will let others put theirs out there too and will not talk down to you. I would absolutely recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do I like him as a person&#63; Um....no. He thinks he knows everything & no one can change his mind on that. Very annoying weekly hw & reading. Test wasn't too hard. He made the class believe everyone would fail. He's not hot at all; has a balding spot & is the only thing interesting in class to focus on.

I didn't like his teaching style, especially his examples and exercises of how we should be 'open-minded.' Also unclear with the final which was one big paper.

I had a A+ on the mid-term and around a C on the final... Very nice guy overall, although unclear at times and he sorta rushed through everything near the end...
