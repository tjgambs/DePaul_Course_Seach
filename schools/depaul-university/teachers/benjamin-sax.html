Extremely intelligent, enthusiastic about the material, and very nice.  A lot of reading (but its worth it, and necessary) exams can be difficult but not if you do the reading!  I loved him, would take him over and over again.  I wish all Professors at DePaul were as knowledgeable and excited about the topic...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2006<br>Class Name: MODERNJUDAISM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME Prof. Class is a bit difficult. I knew nothing about the subject before hand so I struggled a little bit, but Sax really wants you to know the material. Watched Train of Life (excellant film). LOTS of reading. Very willing to help if you need it. Tells great stories too! didnt know about Matisyahu, but out class filled him in. Good dude</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: REL268<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely intelligent man, yet as smart as he is, the class is just as hard.  regardless, i learned more in this class than i have in 20 years at my temple.  very brilliant man.  be prepared for A LOT of work, but if you keep up with it, the information you gain will be priceless.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
