He is even willing to help with resumes.  He loves Sports, especially the White Sox, and as a Sports Management Major has been willing to help me get opportunities with the connections he has.  Really a great guy.  Take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2009<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>refused to clarify a question of mine bc &quot;no one else had a prob w/ it.&quot; he hates puncuation. eveything he writes is in 1 confusing sentence. 355 points in class. 300 are from 3 tests. mess up on one of those, no recovery. huge group project only worth 15 points. totally unclear. makes access project seem SOOO much harder than really is. a jerk.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2009<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>class was easy and was a breeze, he did add a bunch of pointless assignments that i didnt learn from. The access project and Final project sucked and he grades you very hard for the final project especially on timing. But the tests are easy just go to the books website and do the practice quizes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did not care for this class at all. He does not help with anything. He can be very sarcastic and rude. Way too much work for 10 weeks. Don't buy the book you will only need if for excel and access. So just get a friend to give you copies. But I did not like his teaching style at all. He just reads off the slides.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2009<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really bad teacher. He doesn't help you if you have questions, is a bit rude, give too much work for the time allowed n couldnt fully grasp concept. You only need the book to do excel and help with access. But access was so hard and he wasnt avail to help. Sent you to a tutor 4 questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2009<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a bad teacher... I don't think he should teach at all. He doesn't have a PhD and he doesn't know academics. Doesn't use the textbook at all and doesn't give review questions. I felt like I was thrown in the flow of the river. No guidance on his part, he just shrugged...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class seems like a lot of work at first, but its not that bad. Do not buy the book, its a waste of money if you do. For the quizzes, just study the terms on the power point, and make note of what he says is going to be on the quizzes in class. Study that and make some effort on the projects, and you should have no problem getting an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Group project sucks because you are stuck with a bunch of dumbasses. Impossible to pass the exam just by reviewing the notes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Offers no guidance with projects, which means you have no idea how to approach the projects. The class starts off easy, i.e. this is a computer etc. But than all of the sudden he asks you to create an access database and research new IT solutions for an industry!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him...good prof will provide you will real life experiences. I did not get the book and did well in class. Read powerpoint and did well in the group project.  Easy to get B or better.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2008<br>Class Name: MIS304<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the quiz was definitely not all from the powerpoints..in fact it was pretty difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. is easy but there is so much busy work involved. 3 quizes/4 article summaries /excel project/access project and a group project/presentation.  It's not hard but it's a lot! Make sure you don't go over time on your presentations or you will get points deducted.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not waste money on the book! The only time you use it is for the a few questions for the Excel assignment (get from a classmate or copy Qs from the bookstore). Everything you will ever need is on Blackboard. Lectures are boring and some assignments are pretty unnecessary but overall, a pretty easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Like he says, if you get Cs in the tests, and if u do better in article presentations, access project and group projects, you will pull up at least B+. Article summary is preety easy. Access project is kind of hard, but provides extra help, and in group project, make sure u dont go over time limit, he CUTS the points. Other than that, he is easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got an A, and the class isn't hard at all just a lot of work load. The access project was a bit of a head ache. If you don't know access get from the tutor. The group presentation was also a lot of work, especially if you get people in your group who just don't care.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2007<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is very easy & professor is actually not bad laid back guy.3 quizes and group presentation. Quizzes are straight from lectures/slides.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2007<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this prof twice last year. He is extremely nice and wants to get everyone through boring MIS 340 (MIS is my major). I never went to 340 and i got an A. Also, his assignments/project descriptions are so vague, when you ask him he doesnt give much help BUT he never does not grade hard at all, so you kinda do what you want and get away with it</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is great! Class was easy and laidback. If you are looking for a stressless class, this is the one and professor to have. I thought the access project was a bit lame, did not get anything from it, but overall the class was excellent and you should receive a good grade, without even trying to hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, very easy. 3 quizes, study slides and you will easily pass them especially the last one. book is useless. group presentation is easy depending on your group. access projcet can be challenging so either get ready to learn it or get some help. moeller demanded a chili pepper, here it is, you earned it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is awesome! the work load is sufficent: 5 article sums (paragraph each), 3 exams (last one easy A), and one major project, which can be a pain if you have slackers in your group.  Overall he is a good man I have major troubles with my group and he let us turn in our project a day later.Also, book is not needed at all! just read the slides</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Still can't believe I got an A-. This guy is so easy. 3 tests, which you can just study of the slides. An access project which is sort of hard if you don't know how to work the program (get some help for that). And a project/presentation that does require some work. (Make sure you don't go over on time, he'll take off points.) Overall, take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very nice guy, very helpful and approachable.There's a big group project (which can be a pain if your team is slacking), Access project (done in 10 mins if you know basic Access), 3 quizzes and 5 article summaries.Don't buy the book, everything is on BB.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh my god, this guy is the best teacher at depaul. I missed the last quiz, but he let me take it in his office. By the way, the last quiz is a gift because everyone gets and A in it. While I was taking the quiz in his office, we were chatting the whole time and I learned a lot about himself and his philosophy. You are stupid if you don't take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great guy.

His exams are straight forward off the powerpoints which are posted on BB -the same ones used for lectures in class. A good professor to take for both interested and not interested students of MIS.
