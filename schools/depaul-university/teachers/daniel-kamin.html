The only problem with his teaching style is how fast he talks... Have you ever seen the TV show Viva La Bam? Remember the Uncle Don VIto? Yeah...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: F</div><div id="right"><div>The quizzes are so hard that the readings and the lectures do not help at all with those. He does not even really grade you how correct your answers are. Participation is required for this class, but he makes it so difficult because he talks so much in discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy. Learned a whole lot about Israel, Judaism, and Zionism from him. Everyone complains he is talking too much, but I really enjoyed his teaching style and found him funny yet informative. His class was probably the funnest one I've ever taken at De Paul. The final was almost like a party with all the snacks and drinks he brought.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: D</div><div id="right"><div>Participation is vital, but it is almost impossible to participate because he talks so much and takes up as much time to eliminate any chance of participation.  He even grades the quizzes based on how you worded the answers, not really on how correct the answers were.  Lectures and reading don't help at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>During this class, we took field trips everyday, which was fun. The first and last day he didn't stop talking for 3 hour of class. You have to go to classes, but if you do the readings and actually try on the assignments, you'll do more than fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>The readings are essential to do, but they don't help with the quizzes at all.  The quizzes aren't actually graded based on how correct your real answer was; it was rather on how you worded your answer.  Avoid him.  Studying hard and doing the readings make absolutely no difference.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are long and boring. Pushes his democratic views on students in lectures and if you miss one class your grade basically drops. I would never take again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: D-</div><div id="right"><div>The quizzes are composed of questions that are technically random. Readings and lectures do not help at all with the quizzes at all. Even if he says you did good on an assignment, it does not mean you really did well. That is because he does not tell you what your real grade is those cases. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: F</div><div id="right"><div>Readings might be straightforward, but they don't help on quizzes. He grades quizzes to tough that even wording of answers matters.  He makes participation an essential component to passing, but he talks so much in lecture that it is hard to participate.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>On the quizzes, you need to specific, but that won't help either. Instead, he takes off points even for correct answers simply for the way you write your answer even if you have the best answer for a question. Even when he says you did well on an assignment or project, the grade may not really be good as he does not tell you what grade it is.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2014<br>Class Name: PSC200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Daniel Kamin is a very knowledgable professor with a clear instrinsic motivation to go above and beyond to help his students. He will happily take many hours outside of the classroom to talk with you and maintain complete transparency when discussing issues that may arrise between he and his students. Recommended for those who are willing to work. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Readings are easy and straightforward. Loves primary sources and makes you come to your own conclusions and doesn't force them on you like other DePaul professors. You'll get a lot out of this class if you take it seriously. Group projects are a breeze.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: INT365<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seminar-style class, mix of lectures and sometimes brief discussions. Tests are straight forward. Just take notes and pay attention. Fair grader, gives a lot of feedback and asks a lot of questions. Easiest INT class in the entire department. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The readings were interesting but not always necessary to do unless you miss class. He lectures on the readings, gives detailed notes and makes you write 2 papers during the quarter. Exams are based on notes so take good notes. Good professor. Interesting subject.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Some of the material may have been difficult to grasp but he's always there either via email or during office hours to help. He sparks a lot of interest in the subject and makes you want to learn more about what he's talking about. Gives good feedback on papers, if you can read his handwriting. Take advantage of office hours.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: INT365<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kamin's lectures can be long but they're interesting. He gives you a detailed history of the issues, really tests your knowledge but he's fair. He'll play devil's advocate and argue with you, but that's only to help you hone your argument. Go to class, take notes, read your notes before exams and you'll be fine. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112224<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does not understand how to give a cohesive lecture that goes through the history of Israel and Palestine and his voice will drive you insane by the end of class. He assigns way to many readings and writings for a Focal Point. Midterm he give you an id list that covers from Jesus to 1948, ridiculous. I love M.E studies but this guy cant teach. :(</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kamin means well but he is not a good teacher.  He is very spastic and spends most of the class flailing around. He is extremely biased and hates mocks opposing views. He is also terribly unorganized and falls way behind in his syllabus.  Maybe thats because he spends the first 30m mins of every class complaining about how behind we are</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No matter how well you participate, things will never go well.  Quizzes are almost impossible to do well on,even if you study as hard as you're supposed to.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kamin is a good guy. The class easiness overall is middle range. You have to be very specific on the quizzes which are from the readings. There's a couple papers which one should use primary sources and cover both opinions regarding a topic and youll be fine. Participate in class or even nod your head when hes talking.. it goes along way.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nearly half of the grade is based on quizzes that are way too hard and impossible to do well on.  He grades the quizzes too tough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His quizzes are way too hard.  You can do the readings, but it never helps. It does not matter how good you are at writing. Don't ever take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kamin is a little bit spastic but overall a good guy. He picks favorites but as long as you participate in class, you'll be fine. He is very passionate about the subject and I learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Professor Kamin for Winter 2013 and he is an amazing professor! His passion really makes you absorbed the information. Out of all of my classes, I have learned and retained the most knowledge from his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2013<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kamin is an amazing professor. Passionate about the subject and really encourages you to think outside the box. By far one of the most stimulating and helpful professors at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He likes to talk, but he is passionate and is a good person and will meet with you or help you with anything you need.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Daniel Kamin is a great Prof. He really cares about his students.

Like everyone else said, he knows his stuff, but he never shuts up or lets you speak your mind (and in a seminar class no less). Assignments were at least fairly challenging, as was grading, although I can't say I'm happy about spending $30 for a packet I looked at once</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Like the prior comments he is well educated on the subject but talks WAY too much. He is also a piss-poor manager of time so if you have to ask him a 2 second question expect a 20 minute talk about it. Avoid him because he is simply annoying and will get on your nerves. He also has you buy a $30 course packet you never use.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2009<br>Class Name: LPS200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just want to corroborate the comments below mine. This man is educated and well read on his subjects, but he has no idea how to shut up. If you raise your hand to speak, expect to only get 1 sentence out before he interrupts you and talks for another 15 minutes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He rambles on about the same junk every class, but none of it is relevant to the discussion. Interupts you. Acts like a 5 year old. Grades likes he is on drugs. Very stressful. I learned nothing. People say he's nice but after meeting with him outside class twice I disagree - he's pompous, irritating, RUDE, and cannot shut his mouth.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took a class on Israel-Palestinian conflict. He knows a lot about the conflict but has no clue on how to teach. He grades you 33% on participation but he never shuts up. Overall the man is a terrible teacher, when he does ask for your opinion he shoots it down and pokes as many holes in it as he can. I would advise against taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Kamin is very intelligent, but not the best with the lectures/lessons. Class would get off topic and would rely ONLY on readings. Tough grader, but cares about students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am an extremely hard worker, yet it never pays off with him. He is rude, condescending and humiliates students in class. He is overly opinionated and DOES put his personal views in class. The class is supposed to be discussion, but he only likes to hear the sound of his own voice and interrupts anybody that speaks. I wouldn't recommend him at all</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are at all conservative be prepared for an extremely liberal professor. I did not feel that his directions were clearly stated or that class discussion was well organized.  To be fair however he is extremely passionate about the topic and you will learn something should you choose to take the course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kamin is one of the easiest professors I have had at DePaul so far. Barely needed the books and hardly ever did the reading, except I would recommend them for the paper.  There is a 10 page midterm,but it's a research paper, so it is not hard.  Also, the midterm was a little tricky but a huge curve brought up everyones grade. Really wants you to le</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think hes a pretty good teacher. He is liberal, but hes also smart with his politics (&quot;make the best case for the other side & then cut that down.&quot;) The 4 journal entries are easy, quizzes are a bit harder but they're planned. Very interested in the class opinion. He is kind of a &quot;spaz&quot;. I would recommend him bc hes cool, & the workload isn't bad</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took his Soph Sem War on Terror class.  It's nearly impossible to get less than a B+ or B in this class, he gives many opportunities to rack up points.  4 short 1 1/2 - 2 page journal entries, 3-5 simple quizzes, 1 easy group project, and 1 5-10 page paper (no final or midterm).  Talks fast and is kind of a spaz but you will still learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you can handle BS and dont like to think take this class. Liked to start with &quot;Now class, I'm liberal but...(insert something offensive to some group or another)&quot; This guy is full of it and is convinced that any reference to Israelis or Jews is anti-Semitism. He also ripped on particular students when they weren't there, and was intolerant.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, the only balanced one I've had while at DePaul.  Liberal but can barely tell.  Class was pretty easy, just do the assignments, show up for handful of assigned quizzes and you're good.  I failed all 4 quizzes, didn't read the books and still got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, doesn't let his personal political views influence class.  He should teach more classes.  Class pretty easy, tells you when he's going to quiz on assigned readings</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great professor, obviously a few angry students posted the above reviews.  His class is so easy and tells you when he's going to give a quiz.  I'm super conservative and although Kamin is liberal, he is professional and doesn't let his personal opinions dominate the class.  One of the best professors DePaul has!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Kamin, as knowledgeable as he is, is horribly unqualified to preside over an entire class of young adults. His class seems to be nothing more than a forum for himself to verbally ****. He views his class as being a hotbed for edgy political discussion, but it's nothing more than a monotonous snoozefest with a poorly planned curriculum.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: RELIGION<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont listen to the other negative comments. The dude is a decent proffesor who loves what he teaches. The class was interesting and somewhat easy. He gives out a little to too much to read and he talks a lil fast but hes a nice dude.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
