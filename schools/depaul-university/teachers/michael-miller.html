He rubs off with his coarse and dry yet hysterical sense of humor. This class is not an easy A, but not impossible by all means; also, he is a nice guy that is willing to help when you need it. He is sometimes not the most objective, but it wouldn't be fun if he was.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2013<br>Class Name: EDO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing! My favorite class of the quarter, could NOT be happier with the prof. He is not only crystal clear, he is inspiring. If I have the chance, I'll take him again & again. Best professor ever.

He constantly related his lectures to what's happening today and even made dry subjects interesting. There is not a lot of math at all and he gets grades back to you very quickly. I would highly recommend taking Miller.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2010<br>Class Name: ECON306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Miller is a great instructor.  He explains everything very well, gets homework back to you by the next class, and outlines everything he expects.  If you're surprised by something you weren't paying attention.  Grades homework easily and test intensely.  I will take him again if I get the chance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2010<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher at DePaul by far.

He makes Econ interesting and relates it to the real world.  Because of his class I have decided to add Econ as a second concentration.  Take his calss if at all possible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2010<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's just that good of a teacher.  He explains stuff to make you understand it, and he's laid back.  He's open and honest.  But you will work.  He is a very hard grader, but you will learn so much if you take him.  Homework every night plus 10page+ midterm and final.  You will work your rear off, but you'll learn so much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does a fantastic job of relating course material to current economic scenarios and conditions.  He keeps things simple enough for everyone to understand.  He was available anytime I had questions via email.  His assignments aren't difficult but the tests required about 5-6 hours of studying each to earn an A.  He does give study guides that help</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best I've had yet.  Very relevant course with keen insights.  Great teacher who really knows how to convey concepts so we can apply.  Quizzes can be tough; a lot of writing, with essays, a report, and HW due every class.  No midterm; final is in the form of a research paper.  Overall, great prof, great course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2009<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the best professor at depaul knows his stuff, doesn't use textbook and doesn't care about attendance but you wont be able to keep up with the class if you miss a class.

A fantastic teacher and lecturer.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a delight it is to listen to Professor Miller's lectures! The current economic situation added extra fuel to his enthusiasm and to the anecdotes. However, not a very easy class to get an A. You need to convince him to give you an A. Although he clearly has a political affiliation, he doesn't stray with the macroeconomic concepts.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Miller is excellent! I learned so much from this class. not the easiest grader (no curve at all) but as long as you study the notes and handouts, and pay attention in class, you will do fine.  But you need to show up to class otherwise you will be lost. midterm, final and 4 easy papers. no book required. i would take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: ECO104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Miller was one of my favorite professors at DePaul.  I took him several times because he makes class interesting and if you do what he asks of you, which is very little, you will do well in his class.

Love that he does not requires us to buy a book. Love that he explains concepts very well. Love that he brings real world into the lecture.

Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/08/2008<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Miller is honestly one of the best teachers I have ever had. He doesn't just stand up and spew his lectures at you; he actually WANTS you to learn, and he makes himself incredibly available to anyone in need of the help. You basically get free points for doing the homework, and the same questions are on the tests. Very highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2008<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken economics courses from 4 different colleges and he's the best I've had.Very good lecturer who cares that you understand the material.What we learned could have been very boring but he was able to apply much of what we learned unlike other economics professors I've had.Pretty easy and straight forward course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2008<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I go to UofI, took ECO 306 for transfer credit. This is the easiest econ class I have ever taken. I got a 99%, and did all of the homework during class. I don't know how anyone could rate him as being difficult. He takes 20 minutes to explain the simplest material. Only gripe is he swears a lot- really unprofessional</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He wont leave last student without making him thoroughly understand the smallest macroeconomic concept.

Miller is a JOLLY man in class I must say. I am a senior and I think the prof should care. But he goes thru the material so fast just to get it done and doesn't care if we get it or not. The homework sucks. Takes up so much of your free time. Don't recommend him at all!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2008<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He explain materials very clearly. Each week has a assignment. Mid term and Final need to study. I learn a lot from his class. One thing I did not like is he does not have enough time to go over all chapters, only 4 chapters he teaches within a quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Let's face it Economics is not the most exciting class. Professor Miller actually makes the material interesting or at least more interesting.  His teaching style is laidback and he has no problem slowing down to explain the material.  His tests are hard but fair.  There are a couple assignments but they are easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy going professor in an easy going class.

Learned a lot. He does well keeping things interesting/relevant to today's economy. Great sense of humor. Doesn't care if you attend class--but you'll have to to &quot;get it.&quot; Not a tough grader, but does reserve A's for people who give 110%. All A's on HW won't mean A for the class. You must do well on mid-term/final for that.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2007<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes economics look interesting, although it is not.
