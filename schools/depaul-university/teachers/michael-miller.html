Miller's the best. He's just so sweet, and you can tell that he genuinely cares about his students. He teaches you to ensure your understanding.

I would definitely take him again. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2014<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Miller is one of the best teachers I have ever had at DePaul. He rubs off with his coarse and dry yet hysterical sense of humor. This class is not an easy A, but not impossible by all means; also, he is a nice guy that is willing to help when you need it. He is sometimes not the most objective, but it wouldn't be fun if he was.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2013<br>Class Name: EDO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing! My favorite class of the quarter, could NOT be happier with the prof. He is not only crystal clear, he is inspiring. If I have the chance, I'll take him again & again. Best professor ever. (But you do have to study, I worked for my grade and only missed one class). Got a 100 on the midterm & a 90 on the final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't recommend Prof. miller more! He thoroughly explains all of the material and he uploads on-line lectures to supplement the course. I didn't buy the book, he doesn't use it. Attend class it will help you understand the material.  I got an A- but if I had studied for the mid-term then I would have gotten an A+.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor. Very easy class. I got an A by looking over the notes 1-4 times before the midterm and final (and read the chapters).

My second time taking this course and I understood so much more from him than my first professor. He tells a lot of stories that are related to the topic which helps ALOT!

Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2011<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had no interest in ECO before I signed up for this class. Prof. Miller made the class not only interesting but applicable. He is an excellent teacher and the material is well taught.  Another bonus is that there is no book to buy for this class as he gives you his &quot;book&quot; he has written. I learned a massive amount.  Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: ECON306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Miller is the man. There is no reason anybody should get less than an A in this this class. All the exam questions are essentially straight from the homework, and before exams he goes through all the powerpoints and tells you which ones to study. Material is fun and he's an excellent prof. If you get less than an A that's your fault not his.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So far one of the best professors at DePaul. he professor keeps the class interesting and has great knowledge and real work experience to the class.

No textbook--instead, we read essentially 10-page writeups on the topics that Miler wrote himself, and these are very easy to read. He puts everything in real-world terms and applies it to current events. It was a very fast 3 hours each class. Fair, straight-forward, and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best Professors at DePaul.

He constantly related his lectures to what's happening today and even made dry subjects interesting. There is not a lot of math at all and he gets grades back to you very quickly.

He explains everything very well, gets homework back to you by the next class, and outlines everything he expects.  If you're surprised by something you weren't paying attention.

He makes Econ interesting and relates it to the real world.  Because of his class I have decided to add Econ as a second concentration.  Take his calss if at all possible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2010<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's just that good of a teacher.  He explains stuff to make you understand it, and he's laid back.  He's open and honest.  But you will work.  He is a very hard grader, but you will learn so much if you take him.  Homework every night plus 10page+ midterm and final.  You will work your rear off, but you'll learn so much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does a fantastic job of relating course material to current economic scenarios and conditions.  He keeps things simple enough for everyone to understand.  He was available anytime I had questions via email.  His assignments aren't difficult but the tests required about 5-6 hours of studying each to earn an A.  He does give study guides that help</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best I've had yet.  Very relevant course with keen insights.  Great teacher who really knows how to convey concepts so we can apply.  Quizzes can be tough; a lot of writing, with essays, a report, and HW due every class.  No midterm; final is in the form of a research paper.  Overall, great prof, great course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2009<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the best professor at depaul knows his stuff, doesn't use textbook and doesn't care about attendance but you wont be able to keep up with the class if you miss a class.

The current economic situation added extra fuel to his enthusiasm and to the anecdotes. However, not a very easy class to get an A. You need to convince him to give you an A. Although he clearly has a political affiliation, he doesn't stray with the macroeconomic concepts.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Miller is excellent! I learned so much from this class. not the easiest grader (no curve at all) but as long as you study the notes and handouts, and pay attention in class, you will do fine.

He doesn't just stand up and spew his lectures at you; he actually WANTS you to learn, and he makes himself incredibly available to anyone in need of the help. You basically get free points for doing the homework, and the same questions are on the tests. Very highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2008<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken economics courses from 4 different colleges and he's the best I've had.Very good lecturer who cares that you understand the material.What we learned could have been very boring but he was able to apply much of what we learned unlike other economics professors I've had.Pretty easy and straight forward course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2008<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I go to UofI, took ECO 306 for transfer credit. This is the easiest econ class I have ever taken. I got a 99%, and did all of the homework during class. I don't know how anyone could rate him as being difficult.

Miller is a JOLLY man in class I must say. I am a senior and I think the prof should care. But he goes thru the material so fast just to get it done and doesn't care if we get it or not.

Professor Miller actually makes the material interesting or at least more interesting.  His teaching style is laidback and he has no problem slowing down to explain the material.  His tests are hard but fair.  There are a couple assignments but they are easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy going professor in an easy going class. Work load was very manageable. Homework assignment once a week but its bascially free points for studying and keeping you current. Lots of time devoted to discussing issues in the present economy. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great for ECO 509! Learned a lot. He does well keeping things interesting/relevant to today's economy. Great sense of humor. Doesn't care if you attend class--but you'll have to to &quot;get it.&quot; Not a tough grader, but does reserve A's for people who give 110%. All A's on HW won't mean A for the class. You must do well on mid-term/final for that.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2007<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes economics look interesting, although it is not. He is a bit tough but also a fair grader. Highly recommended if you really want to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated how he thought he was humreous. He was not. His jokes wear completly annoying. His class was interesting, however I would have paid more tuition for another professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: ECON<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>had him as a substitute for a few weeks.

He's amusing, and knows his stuff.  Funny too!  His tests can be a little tricky as you need to make sure to include SPECIFIC words.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
