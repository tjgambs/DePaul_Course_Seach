Don't be fooled, it's all  text based. You're marked absent even if you're in seat seconds after she calls your name. Completely ambiguous for homework & other outside assignments. Gets lost in her own discussions. Uses old & out of date material. My advice: run.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2007<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just doesn't seem with it, gets frustrated at questions, zero passion for the subject</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a  terrible waste of money and my time!! It seems harsh, but most comments here are true. Her teaching style was awful- unhelpful & rude. Its not her age- there are great older prof- she was just very STALE and showed no interest in stimulating her class. Also, you get stack of old articles that she’s been using for years!! Very BAD!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I read the reviews on here when I still had time to change classes but took the class anyway because I thought maybe the reviewers were just stupid.

When students asked for clarification, Banan seemed to take offense. Also, we sat in alphabetical order and read outloud while sitting in a circle... it was like grade school all over again. Students were also unclear about what she wanted in our papers and &quot;presentations&quot; (reading our papers outloud).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2006<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This lady shouldn't be allowed to teach.  She couldn't even put a tape into a VCR--honest to God it took her almost 2 minutes to find where it goes.  She also messed up my grade b/c she told us that we could not take the final if we could show her we deserve the A.  She told me I'd get an A and then gave me a B-.  She completely ruined Soc for me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i almost feel bad for her because she's on the older side. I don't think it's really her fault that shes not very good, i just think shes getting too old to teach. Shes very unorganized and her reviews for tests are handwritten by her, and squeezed onto one page, i mean she can't even type her review! not tomention u can't even read it!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2005<br>Class Name: LAWSOCIETY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst classes I have taken here at DePaul.

She is not a little nice old lady like everyone says. Don't go to her office hours either because she is rude, crabby, and a total ****. Her review sheets are a JOKE and so are her tests.

I hate that I took her and that I paid for this class. She can't teach, she doesn't makes sense, she is rude, and she talks about China too much. Last time I check this was America. Don't take her if you don't have to. I'm hoping that after she reads her evaluations she'll retire. I made sure she got a bad one.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, I have nothing good to say about this professor. If you take her class be warned: you will get bored to death and you will learn NOTHING! She made what should have been an interesting subject into an hour of torture.

Just borrow it from someone else to copy the key terms, which is what both the midterm and final are made up of.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2004<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While Prof Bannan is insanely old and seems crazy at times, and usually does not make sense, the class is REALLY easy. Don't be afraid of her, just show up, you dont even always have to do the readings. I got an A without doing much work. Overall easy, dont fear her from other reviews!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2004<br>Class Name: 208<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ugh! she is so unorganized that it's sad, avoid her at any cost, not only is she a space case, but you cannot even follow the sylibus to know what you have to do b/c she changes it and or falls behind.  she forgets important points and makes it hard to understand. time to retire grandma!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The subject is interesting but be prepared to get everything from your readings, THE LECTURES NEVER MAKE SENSE! She's very scattered and unclear on what she wants you to know for your test. Tests are hard, lots of true/false with questionable wording. If you read, you'll be ok</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2004<br>Class Name: SOC301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of reading and writing take this class only if you have patience and open time.  The teacher is a space cadet at times, but a reasonable person. Quiz the second day of class so don't be caught off guard!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class wasn't hard at all--if you do the work. She expects you to keep up on readings, as in this class the students are the ones who lecture. Very dissorganized but talk as a class and you will create order.  Very willing to budge on paper due dates.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2004<br>Class Name: SOC301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is rude, unclear, and slow with everything she does!!!

Shes horribly unorganized and unclear! SHe made a very intersting topic into something that made me want to poke my eyes out! half of my class dropped it the 1st week! i wish i had too!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2004<br>Class Name: SOC3<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think she forgot to retire-she's about 100.  I was in her class one day and found her to be very dated w/ her lecture and demands of her class.
