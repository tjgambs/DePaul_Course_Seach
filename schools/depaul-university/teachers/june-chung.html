Zing! (Look that up if you don't get it.)  But seriously...Professor Chung is deadly boring.  I feel bad, because she is a nice enough lady.  And I can't pinpoint exactly what about class didn't work, cuz I liked the books.  But she rarely has anything interesting to say, and doesn't know how to spark discussion.  Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2008<br>Class Name: ENG383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had her for 383 and 265 freshman year.  Nice, helpful (responds fast to emails), always smiles, very smart, but what strikes me is how much better she seems now than 3 years ago.  Then she was kind of tough to listen to - long lectures, kinda nervous - but now sheâ€™s more mellow and we participate.  I liked her then, but this is a vast improvement.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2007<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her for 270 and 362, and I liked her for both. She's a fair grader, the assignments are not too difficult, along with the readings.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2006<br>Class Name: ENG262<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class as an elective, so it wasn't that I didn't like the material, but the lectures were brutal.  The hour and a half that i was there seems to drag because she is just so frustrating to listen to.  She's nice, the class is easy, but i do not reccomend taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2006<br>Class Name: ENG270<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty nice. Fair grader, sometimes boring lectures but was willing to meet outside of class to look at drafts of papers. Not too many assignments either.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is ok. I probably wouldn't take her again unless I was forced to. Her lectures are not interesting and nothing about them made me (and the others) want to participate in class. She is an easy grader. Class breakdown: 2 short &quot;homeworks&quot;, 1 short quiz, 2 4-6 page papers, final exam. There's not much else to say.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Soo BORING! Not as intelligent as some of the students in the class. Cannot complete a sentence without saying 'umm'. If you want to learn anything you will not like her. If you need to fill your schedule, it couldn't hurt. Couldn't drag my ass to class to save my life.  Should NOT be teaching upper level classes. High School... maybe...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is boring but not hard. Mainly you sit and listen to her talk. She is friendly and will answer any questions you have. You will have to read a book a week (approx 10 books) so if you dont mind that you wont mind the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2005<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice person.. If you want to learn, do not take her... She does not add any depth to the works you read, attendance is required and the lecture consists of her saying &quot;ummm&quot; and questions such as &quot;what happens after this takes place&#63;&quot; Sticks only to the plot and I feel Spark Notes gave more insight... Not worth your time or money..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Other raters have it right. Very nice person, very approachable, knows her stuff, but is very, very long-winded. It really is hard to sit through her classes sometimes, but I think she's a good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: AMERLIT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2005<br>Class Name: ENG270<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>holy crap.... do not take her if it's a night class. I was falling asleep every week. Overall though, she's pretty easy and understanding.. although every other word she said was &quot;uhm&quot; which is tedious for a 3 hour class *sigh*</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most underrated professor @ Depaul... I didn't read a dingle book just use cliff notes and her lecture notes to write journal entries... it's like a jr high english class.. Easy grader always has a smile... very approachable would def take her again</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures are pretty dry, so class isn't too exciting, but you will learn a lot. She is a fair grader though, so if you work hard and show her you are trying, you will probably do well. Rewrite papers if she lets you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The only tough part was actually reading the 6 books for this class.  Discussion sucked but only because no one participated so she turned to lecture.  Would definitely take another class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really sweet, and this class is really easy (reading helps since this IS a lit. course, but i rarely did and am doing well). But it's SO BORING BORING BORING. Wouldn't reccomend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENG256<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this women has no idea what shes talking about. She focuses on small sections of the books that have little significance to the whole of the novels. If your really into literature and like  to find out more than just the suface meaning of books then don't take her as your professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2005<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was pretty easy, a lot of reading but it was good books.  She is really nice, but boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/18/2005<br>Class Name: AMNOVEL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible, oh so horrible!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2004<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is absolutely horrible!I was in her Am.Novel class for 2 days before dropping it.I couldn't stand her lecture style & she has so much busy work that you can&#8217;t possibly learn anything from. If you want to see a wonderful Eng. prof. take a class w/Ingrasci.He's one of the best professor at D</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was kind of boring but the readings were often interesting.  Not a ton of work besides reading.  She is a nice lady and will help you if you ask for it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2004<br>Class Name: POETRY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unstable.  She says one thing but wants another.  She once told me I didn't have a certain element in my paper.  Then after I proceeded to show her I did, she responded by saying &quot;yeah, but not really&quot;.  I got an A in the course, but I will never take another class w/ her again  Avoid this one.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2004<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice professor. Papers are okay if you listen to what she wants from them. Give her something original and you'll easily get an A or B. Class is kinda boring but the material's light. Not bad for a requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2004<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so nice, and I really enjoyed hearing her perspective on the novels we read.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lesson plan is basically telling us what we already can gather from the books we read.  Very little engaging discussion, hate her grading, learned nothing from the class.  Not a good lecturer</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2004<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class goes by pretty slow...but you'll learn all u need to know about poetry...she's really a nice professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2004<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring lectures, but her heart is in the right place.
