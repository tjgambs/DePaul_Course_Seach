It was very hard for me to sit through a long lecture so office hours were really helpful. As far as grading it is the same thing as 111 and 113 so you should be used to it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2010<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor.

He does talk in riddles sometimes but it's only so that he can get you to think about the problem. Doesn't take attendance but has been extremely nice during lab and lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2010<br>Class Name: CHE115<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sommer... is the LAMEST professor I have EVER had. Know your SF's b/c he'll take like 6 pts off a 10 pt prob on exams for ONE SF mistake.  In lecture, he pretty much slaps up sections from the solutions manual. You'll know if he has done original prepwork, because the calculations will be wrong. Oh, and he thinks chemistry is a 'game'...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2010<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken Sommer for Che 111, 113, and now 115. The only reason i'm staying in his class is because all the other REAL ways of learning chemistry are now confusing because of how he taught it. Doesn't respond to emails, doesn't teach. Probably not prepared for class, just do practice problems for &quot;lecture&quot;, but they are nothing like the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: CHEM113<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When you ask Sommer a question, he doesn't really answer the question, he gives you the substance to answer the question, then lets you figure it out yourself. Sometimes this does get annoying. His lectures are decent, he does practice problems most of the time. The book helped me more than he did/lectures. It's a hard course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated having Dr. Sommer. He doesn't TEACH, he just makes things confusing. He essentially talks in riddles. Please, please do not take him. Save yourself the headache. Bad humor, bad teaching skills, tough tests. Seriously. Pick another teacher. SERIOUSLY.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2009<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sommer is a tough grader but is willing to help. Go to the TA for help in chemistry and you will do fine. Even though he doesn't really care about attendance, you should attend his lectures however boring. remember to show work on tests and you might get partial credit!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for lab. Yikes. He didn't explain anything. He's a great guy...if you get on his good side.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i am currently failing this class, because he does not know how to teach! he does help, but is VERY vague. also, i made an appt to talk w/ him about my grade, and he makes an excuse that he has to 'prepare' for his night class, therefore he cannot meet with me, and to wait some other time. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER! save yourself!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very nice sweet guy, but I wouldn't take him again. I am not crazy about his style of teaching, and I think that his tests are ridiculously hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, funny and great for a chem teacher.  Obviously this isn't a fun class for most, but he makes it bearable.  The material makes it hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2007<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unfortunately, Dr. Sommer is one of those professors that simply can not effectively teach.  The tests were not difficult if you did all the example and practice problems in the book.  You essentially have to teach yourself the material because he does such a poor job at it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this is a gen class so the professor has to teach to a whole range of intelligence...even though the class is slow paced its still very interesting. dr. sommer is a great guy who is very friendly and willing to help with any problems. if you are willing to take notes and do the example problems youll definately get an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2007<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chemistry is difficult, but Dr. Sommer is one of the better chem professors at DePaul ... I've taken other chem classes here, and those professors speak another language ... Dr. Sommer does a good job of explaining chemistry, and yeah, sometimes he gets confused himself, but it always works out in the end.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2007<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an amazing teacher.  A genually nice, caring person that wants you to do well.  I think his notes are very helpful and clear and he does a ton of example problems to help you out.  If you dont like chemisty, thats your fault, not his.  You will do well if you just take notes and study a bit.  GREAT PROF</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: CHE115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'll agree that his grammar/writing skills are not exactly the best. But as far as caring about how his students succeed in the class and beyond, he's one of the best profs I've come across. Chemistry is hard. Don't take it out on the professor if you didn't study. For a new professor, he's good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2007<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sommers did not know that the molecular forumula for glucose was C6-H12-O6 and tried to save himself by saying &quot;Oh, believe me!&quot; &quot;I am not a bio chemist!&quot; He also has terrible grammar and spelling skills. He does offer help if you ask and tries to make jokes which are really corny. He is a nice guy to say the least...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2006<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he could be the lamest human being who has ever walked on this earth. i had him for chem 111 lab. he would come in every monday to explain to the class about lab. except instead of teaching us about the hard chemical equations or what not, he would show us how to roll up our sleeves and make a table. it was so belittling. don't take him, seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Sommer is very clear about his expectations for the class. Your entire grade is based on exams and lab; this means that you MUST do well on tests to do well in the class. He will help you if you're having problems. Just do his practice problems and copy his examples in class and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: CHEM131<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chemistry is a hard subject, and requires work.  He is a great teacher that expects you to do the work, but will also help you through the process of getting there as well.  I would hope that anyone taking this class is planning on med school and mcats, so I am hoping this class is as challenging as the mcats, and if so he has done an excellent job</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2006<br>Class Name: CHE<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just wanted to point out that it seems like every time I try to rate this professor it is gone within a week.  Bottom line, he sucks.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2006<br>Class Name: CHEM113115<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree that nobody seems to help with labs or knows what's going on. That's how chemistry labs are at DePaul- it's a figure it out yourself environment. The material is hard and stressful, especially the quantitative lab portion. Be prepared to dedicate a lot of time figuring material out on your own.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: CHE115<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a terrible teacher and mainly because he plays favorites.  I needed help in the, but he never wanted to help me.  He just brushed me off.  It seems like he only pays attention to thos doing WELL in HIS class.  He is extremely unclear and nothing on the test has anything to do with lecture.  The chemistry department needs a whole new faculty!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: CHE133<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>im not even done with this class but i still think he is  bad teacher! he does not explain anything and worst of all writes on the chalkboard so when he erases you cant read anything.. its just bad its all self-teaching and for an intro chem course&#63;! dont take this professor!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2006<br>Class Name: CHE113115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sommer is one of the best profs I've ever had. He truly cares about his students well being in and out of the class room and always has helped me when I needed it, even if he was in the middle of something. People on this site are taking out their frustrations from chemistry out on him. Chem is hard. If you're a wuss, don't take it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2005<br>Class Name: CHE113115<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's soooo bad. not helpful at all. the whole class is trying to teach yourself the material well enough to pass his hard exams.  the labs are tough and no one can answer questions or explain what the labs are supposed to teach you. terrible!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: GENCHEM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he came to be known as CRAZY ROGER!!  He sought me out personally when I didnt do well on a test, he went out of his way to help. Hes nice, funny, and a good teacher.

It seems that there is no one who can answer questions about lab/prelab. Be prepared to handle a tough course on your own, because no one will really help you.

Despite the fact that i have completed this course, I have retained nothing from it. This class felt like an independent study where you had to be self-taught and the material from the textbook was subpar.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2005<br>Class Name: CHE113115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sommer is awesome.

He's disorganized and seems to teach right off his head, that wouldn't be a problem if only he knew what the hell he was talking about! There's no point in going to his lectures just do the practice problems.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: CHE113115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sommer is a good prof. He tries very hard to make things as painless as possible. He really only gets mad when people are obviously not putting in any effort.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2005<br>Class Name: CHE113115<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for CHE 113 and thought he was ok in the beginning but he gradually got worse. Now, I don’t bother going to class because it is a waste of my time. The book is more informative than the “teacher” though I would argue he doesn’t teach. I never know what he is doing and neither does he.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the 3-4-05 comment.

People are taking their chemistry frustrations on him. Chem is hard no matter who's teaching it. Sommer is incredibly nice, cares alot about his students succeeding, and has ALWAYS taken time to help me out.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2005<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never been so dissapointed in a prof.  I agree that he is really nice if you are one of his favoriyes, but if you're not watch out.  I actually walked out of his office in tears b/c he refused to help me w/ a lab.  I really wish he wasn't teaching 115 too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2005<br>Class Name: CHEM113<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2005<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He’s mostly a nice guy but can be a bit of a prick at times. He does go too fast in class and really thinks everyone shares his love of chemistry which not everyone does. He does cover the material and prepare you for the test.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2005<br>Class Name: CHM113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is pretty good as a prof (clear, easy to communicate with) but not a very understanding person.  He can be cool, but also ****you off b/c he can be an idiot.
