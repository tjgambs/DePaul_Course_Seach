	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

Durnell is very nice and caring, and she wants you to do well. Assignments are straightforward. She will stay quiet and wait for you to participate so you might as well talk in class.

Durnell was a professor that was willing to help. She assigned assignments that required a fair amount of time to complete. She is was good in almost every way. The only cons she possesses is that she is very awkward when she talks, thus causing small moments of silence in class. Overall, 9.5/10. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2009<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most useful class I had so far at DePaul!!!

She knows her stuff but isn't one of those English teachers who limits your creativity. My writing has improved drastically- she tells you exactly what you're doing wrong.

She is not an easy teacher, anymore.  Not helpful at all and takes off letter grades for simple mistakes on papers.  She has no confidence at all.

Stay away unless you want to </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is way to hard of a grader.  In my opinion I am a good write and have always gotten A's in english but she just makes you feel like you don't know a thing about writing.

I took this class because this site said she was easy, but she changed! She's the hardest grader in the entire world and class is so boring.
