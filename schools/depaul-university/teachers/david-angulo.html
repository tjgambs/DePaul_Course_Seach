I prolly failed the final and he gave me an A in the class. Not to mention tons of extra credit oppz given by him.  He calls on everyone in class and makes u participate. I never knew the stuff but in the end, I seriously freakin learned it.  What more can you want&#63; An A in the class and knowledge.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2006<br>Class Name: CSC531<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Obviously very interested in this subject, his &quot;specialty&quot; among the faculty at DePaul. Demands class involvement by asking individual students questions during his lectures. Easily available for help. Homework requirements were reasonable and fair. Covers a relatively complex subject clearly.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2006<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As hard of a class as this is, this prof is one of the most helpful profs @ DePaul. He makes sure everyone participates but if u show him u care, he cares and I even ended up gettin an A in the class even though I had solid B's on the midterm/final. He gave a lot of extracredit opportunities as well. :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows the material very well, but takes a SLOW and weird approach to teaching. You will go to class and wonder wth you just learned, because he goes all around the subject material with not enough direct details.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2004<br>Class Name: SE450<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very willing to spend time helping you whenever necessary. Even gave out his personal phone number in case we had questions. Makes you participate in class by asking questions and calling on people to answer. Ran a weekly lab session on his own time to give help. Tests were reasonable and fair.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
