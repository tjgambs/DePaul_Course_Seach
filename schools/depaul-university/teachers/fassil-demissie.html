No matter how hard you try, your writing capabilities will never be up to his standards. Way harder than expected even when you just watch movies all the time. I regret taking this class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: PPS201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Assignments do not involve critical analysis, rather outlining what you read, and there's little room for critical conversation. If you're disagreeing, objectively, with another student who you're on good terms with, he will stop you from continuing seconds into it, and then refuse to allow either of you to speak despite class demands.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2014<br>Class Name: HON301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Students are required to present two times during the quarter which resulted in at least 2 people giving presentations per class session. Because of this, reading was not necessary and the class was largely student led. I was excited about the content material before the class but the excitement quickly diminished as the quarter went on.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: PPS201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Very poor quality. Class is basically student-led. He does not teach or lecture very much at all. There was a large amount of reading and eventually I just stopped trying to keep up. He is confusing and his assignments aren't very hard but they aren't interesting or helpful either. Only take this class if you need to. Avoid taking for an elective.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2013<br>Class Name: PPS253<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Taking this class was a big mistake. He is unclear in what he wants and grades papers more harshly than most English teachers. I think he expects you to write a PhD level analysis. Fulfill your Gen Ed requirement with something else, this one's not worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2012<br>Class Name: PPS255<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think he is a very knowledgeable man, but seems to lack people skills. For the assigned paper he asked students to meet with him and was very concerned about us learning how to write a public policy paper, which I appreciated, but he failed to give much advice or examples as to what he wanted us to do. If you are a non-major, avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2012<br>Class Name: PPS350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accent is a hard to understand, but he is extremely knowledgable about  the subject.

Requires class participation, but just asks your opinion on the topic, so not difficult to find something to say. A far amount of reading but all interesting and easy to read. Class assignments include: 10-page paper, take home midterm, 25-page group project, and a bringing two current stories to class for discussion.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2007<br>Class Name: PPS225<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Globalization class was somewhat boring and his accent was hard to understand. The huge group project is annoying to me, But if you like working in groups then sign up. He teaches difficult material well but is not about flair or entertaining, just teaches.  I learned alot. Kind of egotistical and has favorites!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2007<br>Class Name: HON301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a horrible professor, he ran the class like a Ph.D level class with his ridiculous paper assignments. He expects you to read every piece every written and incorporate it in your paper and expects you to rewrite it 3 times. He doesn't understand students have things like jobs, etc. We don't have time to read and rewrite like he did.
