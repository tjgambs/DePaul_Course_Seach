The timing of his papers were intentionally before midtermfinals so that you'd never be overwhelmed. Two quick tests, you knew exactly what to prepare. A little dry in lectures, but very sweet guy. He even brought food once!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2014<br>Class Name: 220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The person who left a bad rating prolly has the sads bc Prof Squibbs doesnt give A's for C level work. You have to WORK for your grade and if you want to LEARN you won't find a better prof. Ive taken 2 classes with him and even though I only got B's I learned more than in any other class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2014<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Generally and consistently unhelpful </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2014<br>Class Name: 330AND339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken Prof. Squibbs multiple times, and he is the finest DePaul's English department has to offer. He is a brilliant man who makes Restoration literature accessible. He always prompts stimulating discussions be prepared to participate and will push you to produce your very best written work. If you value your education, take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2014<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's engaging and funny.  Makes what could be a dull class extremely interesting.  I <3 Squibbs.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2014<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.

He makes the reading fun and accessible and leads great discussions. He does call on students at random, though, so always be prepared to participate!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2014<br>Class Name: ENG339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Squibbs is the man! Hands down one of my favorite professors. This guy is funny as heck and helps the students that put forth effort so much. Take any and every class he teaches, trust me</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Tough grading on papers and quizzes.

Easy grader. Very funny guy, I'm sure he has a lot of stories to tell from when he was younger! The movies are cool, some get REALLY WEIRD (Naked Lunch...) I'd take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/16/2012<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really great professor!

Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2011<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. He wants you to do well, though the exercises are hard to get the hang of. Likes participation and respects different opinions. Made poetry interesting and occasionally funny. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2010<br>Class Name: ENG339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rich is a genuinely nice person and a great teacher, interested in seeing you do the best job you can as a student.  Writing is central to an A in his class. I don't generally need a lot of aid when it comes to papers, but he still went out of his way to make sure my final piece was at it's finest.  I'd definitely take a class with him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2010<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm in love with this man, I sincerely hope he is not married. Did not know I would enjoy restoration lit so much. He made it fun, accessible, and sexy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2010<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Even though I selected ENG330 for this rating, I have also taken 220 and 382 with Squibbs and only because he is such an awesome professor. He does have high expectations but is really accessible and leads great discussions. A really nice guy that knows his stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2009<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny and interesting guy who is great at leading discussion. Assignments seemed like busy work at first, but really helped me to better understand the material after all. Would absolutely take his class again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: EGN220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, go to class, do the work and you'll get a good grade.

Didn't find the class that engaging.  Difficult material and a difficult final. He was an okay guy, but nothing too special.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2009<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>cool professor, super smart, knows his stuff, funny as hell too.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
