	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

The class is somewhat confusing but Bruce is a super nice guy who is there to help.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2015<br>Class Name: 310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>100% agree with the rater below. Newman's lectures are unclear and unorganized, which made the midterm VERY hard. The class average was a D and he thought that was "impressive." Every week after the midterm is about the group project- so what did we learn that was adequate to take the final? Nothing. He also gives vague answers when asking for help</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2014<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I regret taking this class with this teacher. I wished I took it with someone else. The project takes up the majority of class, that's all we do. Midterm was incredibly difficult because he doesn't teach anything in class, and it was essay. Final is take home but it doesn't make it any easier. Final is essay and very hard. AVOID THIS TEACHER!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2014<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GET A GOOD GROUP! Project takes the whole quarter. Midterm is very difficult and is in class essay. Final is take home, but is also difficult. He is a very good professor in the sense that he knows what he's talking about. Make sure you ask him lots of questions for the project and for the topics he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2013<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Get a good group! Write 2x what you think you should! Teaches like a grad level class. The 10 week research project is confusing and hard. He is interesting and knows a lot. BUT he is a very tough grader given that his instructions are not very clear. I studied twice as much as I did for other courses. Almost impossible to make an A in this class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2013<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Get a good team! Half of the grade is an extended group project you work on mostly in class. Essay midterm and take home final. Write a page per question for the midterm and at least two pages per question for the final (minimum) and you will do fine. Good class, professor is very enthusiastic about marketing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2013<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Get a good team. I've talked with former classmates and all of us would agree this is crucial to getting a good grade. For the record I got a B+. Midterm was kind of tricky as it was short answer, final was takehome. Interesting class, nice prof, but man I wish I had a good team.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away from this guy. Only took him because I was trying to fit in classes before graduation. Spends way to much time talking about his political ideas. All you do is write in this class. The midterm is tricky but you can manage. The final was way to long and was 2/3 restating your group project in your own words. I didn't learn a thing about CB</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2012<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>all you learn in this class is the 4ps and 5 values. Anything else is just to take time out of your day. He grades hard and well...he says he is all about content but there are no page restrictions on the take home final or inclass midterm. His structure sucks and you just gonna write alot. I WOULD AVOID IF YOU WANT AN A! got a B and I am super HAP</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2012<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy but talks way to much about politics. Mid-term isn't too bad if you study, really annoying group project so make sure you get a good group or you're screwed. Also, the final is take home but he expects you to write way too much. This guy should probably just stick to teaching grad students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2012<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was such an easy class. Most of the time you work on your group project in the computer lab, so you don't even have to attend class. His midterm was a little difficult because it was composed of all essay questions. The good thing about the class is that you can take the final home to work on it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2012<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Newman is plain, simply the man. Coolest dude in the world coming from someone who really doesn't like class what so ever.  Nicest, chillest guy on the planet, he is my favorite prof at DePaul through my senior year. Listen to him and just hear what he says about what you think are meaningless things. You will realize they define marketing today.EZ</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2012<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher read through PPT slides the entire class, from the seated position behind computer 90% of the time. Only useful part was the marketing framework. Tests were verbatim regurgitation essays from the text. Teacher is obviously used to teaching undergrad classes and undergrad students. This was a low-end undergrad mkt class for a grad price.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2012<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was ridiculous for a grad level course over the intercession! Come on! 3 weeks... Midterm, 40 page paper and presentation followed by a final&#63; It's MBA meaning we work! Normally the class would be a sleeper but 3 weeks made intense. He needs to teach a political marketing class to marketing MBAs.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2012<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dude wears black to every class and about 75% of class is in computer lab.

The project is pretty annoying. The midterm was pretty tough because it was closed book and essay written. The final was take home, 5 questions, each at least 2 pages. But he seems passionate about the subject, which makes it a little better.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2011<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Summary: He's worth taking. Long version: Smart guy, an expert in the field (even more so in political marketing) with interesting professional stories. Totally approachable and friendly with students. Not an overly difficult course, but not a blow-off either. Midterm (25%), group paper (25%), group presentation (10%), and final exam (35%).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor I very nice. Helpful. But this group project...Lot's of work, especially when you are stuck in a group of 5-6 students who do want to participate. If you are in such situation, talk to the professor, he is very understanding and will help you to solve this issue. Framework and 5 values I can see even in my dreams :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2010<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Eazy class with long and boring group project.  Next to no HW. Eazy grading. Teaching is not so good, he is all over the place which will confuse you. Project is worth 50% of your grade which gives boost to your final grade but the project makes no sense until the last part where you actually analyze data.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2010<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>previous ratings very accurate.  he's a very nice, easygoing guy and lenient on grading. BUT the group project is very time-consuming and boring. it takes up most of the time. he's helpful, but there's just a lot of stuff that goes into the project. not much homework otherwise.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2009<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher, essay midterm, easy final exam.  Don't worry about the things related to project.  Just go with the flow.  You should get an A easily.  Very boring class though for the non majors.  Very tedious project.  I hated the project.  The guy is very good</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class isn't too hard. The midterm was not curved, but all your grades come in the last week of class in a big group project and take home final. Seems the grade comes out of nowhere, so take if you aren't aiming higher than a B. Otherwise just memorize every detail about the outline he gives you and that's pretty much the entire class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2008<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Here's what you'll learn in this class: Consumer behavior in terms of Functional Value, Social Value, Emotional Value, Conditional Value and Epistemic Value... Totally useless.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a bad teacher. Kind of boring but very knowledgable and fair. Take home final and group project takes more than half the term which is 50% of the grade. His grading is fair. Subject was kinda boring. But if he fits well with your schedule i would defanately take him. not a bad choice. There are worse out there. trust me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a boring teacher and subject, but he is very fair with what he gives you.  midterm is stuff that is drilled throughout the first half of the quarter and the final is take-home.  group project takes up most of the 10 week course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's helpfull and a very nice guy. theres a large group project which is worked on the entire quarter a midterm final which are all essay type questions and reading assignments. not a bad teacher at all. for such a dry subject you cant get much better than him anyway.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked Newman. The class wasn't hard. The mid-term is all essay, but he gives you everything you need to study. There is a final project which you spend most of the quarter working on in class. It was tedious, but not too difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is kinda helpful, the midterm is hard if you do not have a book or missed classes.

He is good at explaining MKT concepts.  It is MKT itself that is lame. this required course forces you to work in large groups of unmotivated people to hand out surveys and enter data in SPSS.  these are jobs that I am going to college to avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2006<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgable and he implements a lot of his knowledge in the classroom.  He is an excellent teacher, written many books, member of Betta Gamma Sigma (Commerce Honors Society).  The group project is huge, so stay on top of it! Midterm is 4 essay questions he gives to u ahead of time and final is take home!! TAKE HIM. U WILL LEARN A LOT!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2006<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't listen to these other jerks, they're just bitter because they probably got bad grades on their midterms because they didn't study....Newman is such an intelligent guy that really knows his stuff.

This professor is extreemly interested in marketing and it shows. He is so helpful- do not hesitate to ask him questions. At first I was a little bit intimidate about him, but he's really a lovely gentleman. The group project is a lot of fun, but pick your group members wisely.
