I had slackers, but I still got an A because I did the work. Great teacher, usually lets the class out early. He gives out provisional grades for most assignments so you can fix them for a better grade in the project. Take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: WRD206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor. Made the class funny and interesting, but you have to work for your grade-3 or 4 mini assignments (easy)and one quarter-long report. Overall, great class - would take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2009<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He wants to prepare you for the industrial world.With that said, you?ll find him too picky when it comes to grading. There is a collaborative project that is worth 55% of your grade.He assigns your team members.If you are out of luck and get slackers in your team (like I did), then you are screwed!The fact that someone else?s efforts will determine</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2009<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tony is an awesome professor! The hw is very easy... there is a HUGE group project and 2 individual assignments. It's hard to get an A but if you work hard, you can def pull it off.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2009<br>Class Name: ENG202C<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had Tony when he was teaching technical writing at Penn State. You guys at DePaul got a great teacher!! He will definitely teach you how to write better with his eye for detail, while keeping things real interesting with his down to earth sarcasm. Has a great sense of humor. I recommend, regardless of where he teaches, that you take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2008<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very picky and challenging professor. Definitely one of the better professors here. Go to class, read the book, and do the assignments. He allows redos and gives tons of feedback. Very  sarcastic. I completely disagree with the Jerry Seinfeld comparison; this guy has a much less dry sense of humor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2008<br>Class Name: WRD206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am taking him for professional writing, and the class has been extremely helpful. Time always flies because he is extremely entertaining as well as helpful. He is a professor that understands that stuff comes up, if you talk to him he's usually pretty cool about stuff. Real funny, real intelligent, cool guy. I take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: ENG301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor.  It was his first class at DePaul, seemed like he has been there forever.  Fit right in and is a great teacher, and extremely easy to talk to about anything.  TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN.  Paper's aren't that hard and you can re submit them with the changes he gives you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: ENG301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is Professor Ceraso's first year at DePaul, and they picked a winner! &quot;Tony&quot; has a very 'Jerry Seinfeld' quality about him which makes him entertaining. No tests, all papers- which can be a bit exhausting but not difficult. He is always available for help and gives great feedback. Take this professor for Profesional Writing!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: WRD305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard, but fair teacher. Gives helpful comments on assignments, which you're allowed to rewrite. Can be extremely sarcastic, but entertaining</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
