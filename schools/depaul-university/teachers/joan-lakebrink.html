			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

Some of these reviews had me a little worried but this ended up being my favorite class of the quarter. Half the classes are spent watching movies.

She is an old lady and is extremely interested in what she teaches. She gives a lot of papers and theyre unnecessarily long. We do presentations as well but overall the work is not hard. We use the Voices of Diversity book quite a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was the easiest A I have ever gotten. We had our midterm and final on three or four concepts from our book, that's all. There's practically no homework, two papers, a few powerpoint presentations and our final ended up being a take-home. I loved Ms. Lakebrink too, she was hilarious and the class was always entertaining.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a character. Professor Lakebrink can be frustrating at times, but just talk to her during office hours to clear stuff up. She can be helpful if you ask. The grading system is nuts, but its possible to get an A.

EXTREMELY disorganized and unhelpful. Seems really spaced out and confused. Does not answer questions. Grades very meticulously, taking points off for grammar and spelling mistakes.

We didn't do anything in class except talk about readings or personal connections. I heard from word of mouth that she gives extra credit for bringing her coffee...

She definitely deserves a red hot chili peppers if you know what I mean.Second, she gives you tons of extra credit if you bring her a bag of coffee. Anyway, the class was easy. The papers are long, but it's all BS topics so you can make stuff up and its all opinionated so she can't grade you down.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>overall a pretty good class. papers arent bad at all. fun assignment to go explore a neighborhood. nice teacher, easy class. def take!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/16/2009<br>Class Name: ISP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>her class was so easy. i would definetly take her again. cancelled alot of class, the papers were long but superrr easy. you can pretty much talk her into changing any assignment. and we had no final</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lakebrink is one of the most valued assets DePaul University has.

I didn't do a few assignments, and still got an A... obviously, an easy course. Don't take this class with her if you actually want to learn something. Also, you can convince her to do just about anything, like change the due date of assignments. And the midterm and final are both open notes</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was so FUN AND BORING at the same time. We ran the class which is why we didn't have a final. YOU CAN REVISE EVERYTHING except MidTerm and Final...and she only gives out A- and lower...i think 1 person got A's on assignments..but I ended up getting an A in the class.

Its almost impossible not to get an A in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Considering it is a multiculturism class, Prof Lakebrink teaching it is quite ironic. Politically incorrect, yet her comments will make you laugh. Easiest A I've ever received. If you attend class, do the simple reading reviews, and sit still, you'll do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is all over the place. Some of her comments are relevant and meaningful, other stuff makes you wonder if maybe you heard her incorrectly. Does not stick withthe syllabus,and her policyon turning in work is loose at best. The most we ever learned was from a ten year old video. This class is an easy A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The subject material is very interesting and makes you think, but she is extremely dissorganized. She is late almost every class and doesn't usually stick to the syllubus. However she's a nice woman and very easy. I didn't have to work hard at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is somewhat incompentent but is not as bad as some of the people on here say she is. Class was really easy and it is true that the syllabus is not followed. She also has bad management skills but does appear to be somewhat knowledgeable to say the least.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: ISP201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was one of the easiest teachers I have ever had.  Was not looking forward to taking the Soph. Seminar, and looked at it as a blow off class, and it was.  She was always late to class, very unorganized, and cut out at least 1/3 of the syllabus, AND I LOVED IT!!!  If you want an easy A or B with minimul effort, take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the syllabus was thrown out the window. we never kept up with the readings, we watched movies, the midterm was postponed two weeks and the final was CANCELED! we had two paper/presentations: one where we explored a neighborhood and another presenting our culture. the teacher is extremely hard to deal with....scatterbrain</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2005<br>Class Name: AS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lakebrink shows up 10-30 minutes late for every class, gives 30-45 minutes breaks in the middle, and is completely unprepared and unorganized for every class.  While she may have a plesant demeanor in conversation, she is a really bad teacher. Wait for another professor to offer the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All I want to know is who gave her a teaching degree&#63; Although the class is easy dealing with her is not. I completely agree with what everyone else here has said. I highly recommend avoiding her as a professor (I use that term loosely) at all costs. I learned more from others in the class then her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: ISP110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lakebrink comes to class 10-20 minutes late EVERYDAY! She is very unprepared and all over the place. Who gave her a teaching degree&#63; I thought opinions couldn't be wrong&#63; Apparently, in her class they are! Don't bother with her, she is a terrible waste of money and not clear, arrognat and the such.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2004<br>Class Name: EDUCATION<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst professor I have ever had in all my life.  For an education class this was the antithesis of what to do when you become a teacher.  She not only  came to class unprepared but she was very rude and arrogant.  Clearly has not been in a real classroom in decades. Avoid at all cost. Refund&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: SOPHSEMINAR<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For a class on diversity, she doesn't have a very open mind.  Class is worth going to for the simple fact that she is so dumb it's entertaining.  Don't worry about debating your grade, because she just can't understand what the hell your talking about.  She sucks!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2004<br>Class Name: SOPHSEM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this was the easiest class I have taken in college thus far, but the most disorganized, unfocused, and confused professor I have dealt with. She just can't keep it together and it gets annoying, but to me it was worth putting up with for an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY EASY A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree that some parts of the class may not be clear or get off course.  But overall, all you had to do was show up and listen.  She isn't a hard grader and is a nice woman.  There was not alot of work.  The homework and test are not difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the worst teacher I have ever had. She had no idea what she was attempting to teach and even when she had somewhat of a clue she was so scatterminded that it didn't matter, not to mention she tried teaching things that were historically inaccurate.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2004<br>Class Name: SOPHSEM<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's totally all over the place.  the class argued with her a lot.  we learned about some interesting things, but you have to tell this lady exactly what she wants to hear or else it's wrong.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2004<br>Class Name: ISP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes one of those u cant really explain, except to say shes very ditsy. its not a hard class, but putting up with her is.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>During class she can get distracted very easily, but she is very helpful.
