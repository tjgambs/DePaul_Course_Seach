She goes over some information in class, but she doesn't always do a thorough job of explaining the concepts.  This made the class frustrating since everything revolves around the concepts.  The class subject overall is interesting, but I recommend finding a different professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2011<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is nice most of the time.  Her grading was way too hard for the material.  Her lectures where boring.  Wish I would have taken a different professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2011<br>Class Name: ART176<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She can be funny at times, but her expectations of students are very high.  She is also a VERY picky grader. Work wise, there are readings every class which are generally a bit on the long side.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2010<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree that her accent does something make class frustrating but overall I think she is a pretty decent teacher. She is extremely funny in my opinion.It's not hard to get a good grade. Just review the notes ahead of time and do the readings and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2010<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hyunghsin is a very nice person, but I did not click at all with her teaching styles.  She is a new professor at DePaul and had very high expectations for her students.  She is a VERY hard grader.  If you don't plan on studying a lot for this class, do not take this class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2010<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hyungshin is so sweet and I found her Asian antics hilarious. Unfortunately, she has a very heavy accent and her sentences don't always make sense. I found myself frustrated in the class because Mass Comm could have been awesome, but instead I spent all class trying to decipher what she was saying.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
