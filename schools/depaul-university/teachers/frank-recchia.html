That being said he is a nice guy, its a very straightforward class, and even though the tests are hard, they are manageable if you put the work in. There is a fair amount of homework as well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2014<br>Class Name: ACC543<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very kind professor. I wouldn't say he is talented for teaching, but he tries to make everything clear. He is an easy grader, just do the homework and quizzes.

If you have a chance, you must take this teacher. His class was not bad for a major accounting course, and he is such a glass half full person, he will make you want to come into class on saturday mornings. He also buys dunkin donuts for his classes on midterm and final days.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2013<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Frank is a great instructor.

He does not try to trick u, and does put in a healthy curve. The class is boring, and is all based off of ppt that he just reads, and going over h'w that is already on blkbrd, so going to class is really just a waste of time. Get the book! You will need it for the long hour of cramming b4 exams</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard subject but professor is very easy to understand. Exams are straight-forward. The material is difficult to master, but what he tells you to study is exactly the way it is on the exam. The only way to pass is to study hard and pay attention in class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Subject is extremely hard but Professor is really helpful & makes subject so much easier to understand.
