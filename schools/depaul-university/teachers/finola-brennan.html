I took this class in hopes of actually learning something. Of course, I would like to receieve an "A" but I actually want to learn something and want to earn my grade. However this is the most disorganized teacher. She is inconsistent with grading, late grading papers, she is short with students and makes you fee stupid.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2013<br>Class Name: MPS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very confusing about the dates and unclear about the assignment. I agree. Unfair grader and never really explained or went over the four frames. Spent most of the time talking about her NPO. Taught the class not like it was an intro but like we were all experts already. Take at your own risk.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2013<br>Class Name: MPS500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Brennen was pretty good-often confused about dates though. Grading was somewhat inconsistent. Some people were hit for things that others weren't. Made class interesting with her work in Non-profits.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
