The thing about his class is you have to actually apply yourself. If you read the chapters and do the homework you'll get an A or a B for sure. remember** Read the chapters and do the HW. During class he goes over the history/theories behind chemistry so you have to go home and figure out how it works.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2011<br>Class Name: CHEM102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome old man with awesome old man jokes. 10 hws & 10 quizes & he drops ur 2 worst in each category. the only reason u need to show up to class is to turn in hw at the beginning of the week and takea quiz at the end of the week. hw and quizes straight out of book but he only quizes on the basics. highly recommended. HIGH-ly ;)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2009<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Some people say the hw was long and hard...I never took more than an hour to do them, and lowest grade I got on any was 85%(most around 95%). Quizzes arent too bad, as he goes over the material right before the quiz. I didnt read any chapter and am in line for an easy A. Lectures are dry, but you can tune out 80% and still get the important stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2008<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG I hated Chem b4 taking this class. He is a very good teacher, very nice and helpful. 10 HWs & 10Quizzes one each week. 2 lowest HW and Q get dropped. Lots of extra Credit. I got a B+ without even trying. Seriously and he is not that boring, if you take good notes you will do good on quizzes. Trust me, just have to listen and show up to class:-)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2008<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can go two ways with Kozac. He is a great teacher, very accommodating and always willing to help a student. He will answer any question you have. The class---- stinks. You have to do homework that is long and kind of tough as well as take quizzes every week.  He teaches the same way he taught his class at Princeton. YIKES!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2008<br>Class Name: CHE101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, chemistry is not my forte and I went into this class optomisitc and my heart was crushed. This guy is so boring to listen to, his quizes are insanely difficult and the only people who were doing well in his class were those who love chesmity. I would not reccomend him. The only good thing was his prompt response to emails</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. He really wants his students to learn. very available, will answere any questions at any time via emial. Gives easy h/w and even extra credit at the end of the final h/w and quiz. H/w and quizes worth 80% together.  really a great guy, that cares about his students and jokes around alot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2008<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He assigns h/w that takes you LITERALLY 3 hours to complete every week...and I was in Honors Chemistry in high school.  The class is ridiculously boring, prepare to teach everything to yourself, and fail all of the quizes; like I did.  HOWEVER!  The way he grades the final MAKES it so that you have to pass. Even after everything tho, I got a B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: CHEM100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Drops your lowest 2 quiz and homework grades. Don't have to attend class, really boring, but incredibly sweet man. I really didn't try all that hard and got an A. The homework does NOT take long i have no idea what the other person is talking about. If you don't want to do it, you can just take a 0 and it'll get dropped</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2007<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>people only come to class on exam days. being a freshman fall quarter in this class, he was a good teacher but you actually have to TRY and read the book. just dont slack off, like i did, and youll be fine. it would help if you had chemistry for a couple years in HS, although he stresses it doesnt do any help.. it does. id recommend him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2007<br>Class Name: CHEM102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The quizes he gives every week are ridiculously and the homework is very time-consuming.  Plus, he does not curve grades.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: CHEM101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely the worst professor at DePaul.  He is so unclear and doesn't know how to teach.  Also, he makes you do the homework before he teaches the material and the material taught in class are the &quot;missing pages in the book&quot;.  If you decide to take the course, plan to get a bad grade or fail.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2007<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's such a nice teacher, but as everyone says...boring class. I'm not a science person, but it's easy to pass the class with at least a C. If you need a lab, take him because he is available for help 24/7!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quizes can be tough; but he drops your lowest grade. All multiple choice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2007<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>yea, this guy is boring, and i think hes just too old to be teaching, hes really really nice tho, but not a good teacher, class is pointless, all you have to do is read the book really well and do the homework, thats what the quizes will be on, class is nothing tho, dont even go for the whole time, jsut to turn in homework and take quizes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2007<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this teacher is REALLY boring. I mean REALLY BORING. And he is really unclear when he lectures.  His tests are easy and stuff but if your the kind of student that likes things explained really well, you don't want this teacher.  Hes SOOOO unclear and SOOOO boring!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2006<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures can be boring because it IS chemistry, but he always will help you out no matter what time of the week.  wants you to succeed.  pushes you to work hard.  if you need to take chem, take Kozak</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2005<br>Class Name: CHEM100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool old man...
