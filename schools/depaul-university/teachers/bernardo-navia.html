	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

He was teaching the class I took for the first time and was pretty disorganized, but in the end it was pretty successful. I do think he speaks too much English for an upper level Spanish course. Love him as a person, so-so as a teacher, but I would definitely give him another shot :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2009<br>Class Name: SPN126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The absolute best professor I have had at DePaul!!!!! The kindest man in the entire world! Everyone should take a class with him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very chill. I think his accent is Chilean. Teaches so you understand the basics. Test after every chapter, comps, and orals. some HW too. Class is fun because he is interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: SPN124<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher. I've always wondered why my Spanish teachers didn't explain difficult concepts to the rest of the class in the most simple, comprehensible, and useful way possible. He does this. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2008<br>Class Name: SPN124<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good professor.  He really wants his students to do well and he was always willing to help and made himself really available.  He made test review sheets even though he wasn't supposed to.  He has an accent, but it's not bad at all he's lived here for like 25 years or something.  4 quizzes, 2 compositions, 1 oral 'exam'. Take him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bernardo is not a good teacher. He speaks in english the majority of the time and there isn't much class participation. I think my spanish got worse with him as my teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2008<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is really incredible. He grew up in Chile under Pinochet, if that means anything to you, and he's always got something interesting to say each class. He's not a very tough grader, and there isn't a single D or F that you can't talk your way up to a C. He's nice, and pretty funny. Take him if you have the opportunity.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2008<br>Class Name: SPN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Profe Navia is probably my favorite teacher that I have ever had at DePaul.  He is very insightful and really piques your interest in the subject. He will make a point to talk to every student personally to find out their opinions and progress on the course. If anything, take him cause he's definitely easy on the eyes :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Can't go wrong with Bernardo.  He's nice, he's helpful, he's funny, he'll cut you serious grading slack just because he likes you.  As if that weren't enough, he's a good, engaging teacher and he knows his****.  Definitely take him for ALL 100-level Spanish if you possibly can - you'll learn what you need to and have fun doing it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: SPN207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bernardo is a wonderful teacher and a great guy. He is genuinely interested in what his students have to say and treats them like adults. The most difficult part of his class is that he doesn't spoon feed you the information. You practice the material in class, but usually I had to learn it outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bernardo takes the spanish language and transforms speaking into an art form. He spent entire classes discussing politics, war, love, faith, and dreams. He is the kind of professor you won't forget.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2007<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>bernardo is a delight! he encourages us to do our best, and makes me want to learn spanish. i love him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's good at sharing experiences and teaching you about culture. He is not, however, the best at teaching grammar. I recommend taking the class for the experience and having a tutor or taking the time to read the book to help you with grammar if you're not already good at it. If If you don't understand, ask. He happily answers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2006<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>amazing~ there is no way you can not like him, and in most girls cases fall in luv with him after the first day of classes~ I think the best thing about him is that he is completely honest with us about anything and everything-definitely take him if u can</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2006<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is the best teacher I ever had at depaul.

He jumps around a lot and does not emphasize the grammatical points enough.  His love of his subject is clear and he enjoys teaching</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: SPN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bernardo is a great teacher and a great person.

He makes a boring Spanish class bearable, with his hilarious stories. You will learn, despite the fact that the workload is easy. He's a native speaker, so your pronunciation will improve just from listening to him. If you're taking intermediate spanish, make sure it's with him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2005<br>Class Name: LATAMERCIV<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a great class!

If you are not doing good in his class it's because your not working hard as you should be as a  student not b/c of your gender.
