	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Buy Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />

He is so interesting and helpful! you writea big essay but he's really open to whatever you want to write about, and he is lenient with extensions. No midterm or final, but one page papers due every week about class discussions. The Discussions are so interesting that they are super easy to write about.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you do all the written work you will get an A.

His lectures were interesting and he made you feel comfotable participating.  The class was fairly easy, reading material was a little difficult but his lectures usually clarify concepts. Take this professor, I can't recommend him enough!  oh yeah, he does pace back and forth a little too much!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2006<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Behun was a great teacher. His class was very thought provoking. He may be arrogant like one person said, but I think he has a right to be because he knows Greek and German and has a book getting published. He is also very available for help outside of class and will proofread rough drafts which is awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2006<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont believe the hype! This professor Sucks. He is arrogant and a total Jerk. Hes hard and too stuck on himself to see past his own deception. I totally hated him. couldnt really focus on material becuase of his cocky attitude.

Not a difficult class, but WOW did I really learn a lot!  Totally made me think about the role of God and freewill in a really cool way...i dunno, I can't explain it, it was just a really great class.

He's very nice, but can be boring at times. Weekly thought memos, and two papers (5&9pgs each).

He is knowledgeable and loves his job.  Weekly thought memos are easy 1 page papers.  Other than that there is a repsonse paper (4-6) pages on a reading of your choice.  And a final paper.  His lectures are not boring at all.  He likes beer too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2006<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Behun was one of the best professors I have ever had! He is very interested in what you want to learn about the topic! Take him... you will be very happy you did!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Behun is such a fun guy! He relates everything to modern day stuff so you can understand it. There isn't a lot of class work just a weekly &quot;Thought Memo&quot; in addition to 1 Response Paper and the Final paper. I can't wait to take another class of his....definitely take him!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2005<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof was fun and sarcastic (in a good way =).

Go to class and you'll survive.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Behun is probably my favorite teacher at DePaul.  I have taken him twice and he makes his classes fun and interesting.  As long as you go to class (he definately takes attendance) and do your thought memos you are sure to at least get a B.  I would strongly recomend that you take his classes.  He is an asset to the school.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Behun will def intimidate you at first with his bald head and accent but after a couple classes he is sure to become one of your favorite teachers at DePaul. PHL 100's content is difficult but Behun makes it easy understandable with his crazy stories and discussions. He knows what he is talking about and if you get him as a teacher you are lucky!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man will intimidate you the first day of class, but after that, he is probably one of the best professors at DePaul.  He is confusing, but then so is philosophy.  He will make you think, and work hard to explain everything.  I've always hated philosophy, but he challanged me to think, and to work in the class,and it paid off in the end. Thanks</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is awesome. Makes you think about topics you normally wouldnt care for. Readings are not too bad, and his discussions are interesting. Doesnt bore you to death, but makes you think about cool stuff. Papers due every week, and 1 paper 4-6 pages and final paper 10-12 pages. Also he reads this site! What a down to earth guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof is the best one i have had so far in my college career. He really knows his stuff and can answer any questions. Most importantly he explains it clearly and in an interesting way that keeps your attention. He is also willing to help outside of class. I actually enjoyed  This class went way above and beyond my expectations! He is a great gu</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Behun is awesome. He teaches you alot if you pay attention and attend class. If not, all you really need to know are 2 philosophers for the midterm and final paper. He knows EVERYTHING! especially all languages including german and greek. i live by this website and i say : TAKE HIM FOR SURE!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So far, the best prof I've had (jr. yr.).  very intelligent and will change the way you think.  he is not out to pump out mindless student drones but rather to change your thinking.

He is passionate about the subject and makes the topics understandable and interesting.  Mixes anecdotal examples in, often to humorous effect.

His lectures are sometimes very interesting but he does talk a lot and it could be shortened but it's not that bad.  The papers are very easy and very light.  He doesn't have much work to be done in his class and grades are very easy to obtain. He is very organized.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely a teacher I would take again.  Thorough lectures that illuminate the reading material.  Funny and approachable.  Only problem I have is that I have no clue what grade I am getting in the class.

He is an incredible orator because he manages to talk for the entire class and still keeps everyones attention. His work load is manageable and he is extremely funny.
