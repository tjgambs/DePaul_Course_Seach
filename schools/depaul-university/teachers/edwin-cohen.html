Over half the class had to drop after the midterm- I don't know why  I didn't.  He is older than the hills and subsrcibes to some form of teaching that was popular with the pilgrims.  Under no circumstances should you take him- Wait for summer school.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID AVOID AVOID!!! Take this class if you like to learn on your own. He gives horrible explinations and does not go over the material well. Midterm and Final are very hard. Grading is done based on midterm and final and a few points for homework.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2005<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prepare to work really hard.

It takes discipline to pass the class but overall, he is an effective teacher.

He simply stands in front of the class and talks to himself for an hour and a half. If you ask him a question, he'll try to put you down. Simply the worst teacher here.  It is nearly impossible to get an A, unless you read the chapters 10 times each.  I know that you have to take him, so beware and do keep up on the HW</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've been here for three years and this is the worst teacher that I've run into at DePaul.

It doesn't matter that he is old, he simply cannot teach. He didn't solve even one problem. He just go over the &quot;illustration problems&quot; from the book. That's it.
