Depends on students to teach each other the text and then doesn't understand when the highest exam grade was a B. Repeats stories about himself over and over again for the entire 9 weeks. The class is boring and drags on. Don't take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2006<br>Class Name: CMN211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst teachers I have ever had because he is unclear and boring.  Doesn't teach in class and expects you to ace the midterm by teaching yourself.  Don't take him!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>tells the funniest stories i have ever heard in my life. but theyre only funny because they don't really make any sense. i really look forward to this class everyday. no homework. tests are based on the book, so just read. i really really like this guy a lot. wears cosby sweaters.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: CMN211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so unhelpful, you could ask him a question and he answers by talking about himself. He wastes time every single class period repeating stories about himself. Do not take this mans class. Not a single person got an A on his midterm and he didnt see that as a reflection on his teaching at all.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
