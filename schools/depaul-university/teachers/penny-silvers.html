She really cares about her students and their learning experience in her class. She wants to help us as teachers be better prepared to enter the workforce.  I have 20 LA units from her class because of the way she set up our group work!  Lots of great activities to use and she makes you DO them so you know how it feels.  SMART LADY!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2007<br>Class Name: TL410<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very judgemental and condescending, gives you an A, but will talk to you down first</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Penny is awesome--best prof. I've had at depaul so far.  The class is A LOT of work but at the same time you get a lot out of the class---material and knowledge you will definitely use as a teacher.  I highly recommend taking a class with her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Penny is the best.  She is one of the most pleasant professors I've ever had - smiles all the time.  She has real world experience and loves what she teachers.  She is tough, I took this class only and still felt the work was heavy.  However, it is relevant.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2006<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Silvers is an overall great professor-you will get a lot out of her class.  Pros---you learn a lot, engaging material, she is very nice, everyone takes turns bringing snacks to class, text books are relevant and under $100  Cons---lots of group projects, heavy workload---if you are taking another class the same quarter, forget it</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
