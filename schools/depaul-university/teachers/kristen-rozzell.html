Just like any other online class. Requires subscription to New York Times online. Most of the material discussed comes from there. This kept my interest because I like discussing current events. One 8-10 page paper and many other little assignments. I don't think I had to buy any  books. Overall good class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Since it was an online class, we used the discussion boards a lot. Expectations were a little unclear for a couple assignments, but she was quick to respond to emails and questions on the discussion board. Final digication portfolio is worth 40% of grade!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't buy the st. martin's handbook, you never need it! Gives a lot of unclear assignments and hardly gives any feedback, but if you stay on top of your work, it's not a hard class. Grading is pretty fair. Her writing is atrocious (grammar, spelling...). Lots of assignments with harsh deadlines. Do the work ON TIME, you'll get an A </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2014<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fair grader with a clear grading criteria, very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seems really lazy because she doesn't provide useful answers to questions and takes weeks to grade assignments. Instead of actually teaching online, she just tells you what to read so the class is pretty much self-taught.  Worst of all, she's a writing professor who makes frequent typos.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: INC</div><div id="right"><div>WRD104 is a basic class that everybody has to take, but this professor and her assignments have taken up a significant amount of my time this quarter. It's a lot of busy work and there are different assignments due on almost everyday of the week.  Everything is based on the New York Times which I found irrelevant and not useful. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Took two classes with her. Incredibly facilitating, very passionate about writing, makes herself available to anyone who wants to learn. A great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My class was a hybrid meaning half in class half online. Still, she was great! So helpful, clear, and kind. I found her assignments easy with PLENTY of time to complete them. She wants every student to succeed and does a great job of ensuring that happens. TAKE HER, I would take her again! One of the best professors I've had!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class. Assignments are clear and plenty of class time is given to complete them. Textbook is only used for the first couple weeks. Very sweet and approachable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Rozzell is amazing at her job. I do not know why other people say she is unclear; I have always found her instruction and feedback to be crystal clear. She may seem intimidating, but she is actually very approachable and SUPER easy to contact outside of class.  Great great professor who knows her stuff! She really improved my writing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE professor. The class could be easy if she was a good professor but she is NOT. Assignments are NOT clear and she is NOT helpful. Also, with the topics you write about, she is so biased and gave other students lower grades bc she didn't agree. Worse professor I've ever had. Don't take WRD 103 with her, I recommend ANYONE ELSE.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a good prof. If  you have questions she'll answer them in detail and do everything she can to help you. If you need this class shes a good prof. Easy B you'll have to work for an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Homework relies on a book in the beginning of the quarter, but she stops using it by midterms.  She grades papers fairly and allows class time for peer-editing, asking her questions about your paper, and individual work.  Takes the time to meet with you outside of class.  Lots of deadline grades to make sure you don't procrastinate! Take it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class is an easy A if you do the readings (they're always really easy) and follow the criteria for the essays. She gives pretty straightforward guidelines for essays and she's really approachable if you need help with an assignment.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Assignments were unclear, but she generally graded easily. Awkward teacher, but she's chill too. It was one of my favorite classes because we didn't really do much. Do your readings and the papers are easy. She doesn't take attendance. An easy A if you do all your homework. Definitely take her if you want to get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want an easy english class, take this one. She is really unclear as to what she wants but if you ask her she gives you a little more help. Lets you redo papers for your midterm grade, easy on deadlines. Not interesting and she seems bored like she wants to be shopping and not teaching. Average class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very frustrating. She clearly does not read through papers well. I had many comments from her that were overturned once she actually read through the paper in front of me. Her emails and assignments make little sense. Her feedback is rude. Avoid her if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor, she's a format Nazi when it comes to writing papers, very easy grader, if you're shaky on format and need an easy A take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher ... ended up with a A.. anyone taking this class want the book for cheap contact me at 630-344-2867.

I'm basically the same writer I was before I took the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's the bomb. Very understanding about deadlines and is pretty care free. You can miss a lot of class even though it says you can't and she lets you rewrite everything. Sweetest southern lady ever. Take her for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>you need an A&#63; you got one with her 100% just dont turn anything in late.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's pretty easy if you just go with what she wants. Very unclear with directions. But an easy grader. She really had no interest in being in class, she seemed bored and uncreative. But hey it was easy, shes a very nice person.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was an amazing professor.
