	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

The only complaint I have isn't his fault; I thought the class would go more into photography, but it's mainly architecture.  Really into what he teaches and gives good (if long) presentations.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2005<br>Class Name: ECT250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Janossy is my favortie prof by far at DePaul.  I have had him as a prof 3 times and all three times he was excellent. I am honored to say he was the most motivating of all my profs and I now have a great job in the tech field thanks to his leadership. I would reccomend him to all who want to do something with there life. He is the best!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2004<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!  His midterm and final are straight from the notes, so study them.  Reading the book is pointless.  Also, if you're lucky, if you do better on the final than the midterm, he'll take the final exam score over the midterm score.  Definitely benefits the student.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: INTERN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, this guy is a real relic. He's out of touch, plays hilariously bad &quot;corporate team&quot; movies, and brought in a speaker who was such an 80s relic it was pathetic. He also assigned a 12 page paper on a topic we didnt even discuss in class. AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is super cool. He is sooo helpful, very leanient, and accepts late work with no penalty. He also took the time to show us exactly how to write a good research paper. Really helpful teacher who genuinley cares about his classes .</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: CSC210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY GOOD TEACHER!!!

The class and homework were pretty easy until the end of the quarter.  Very late with grading and getting back to you sometimes.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
