Rather than letting English and grammar lessons consume you, he interweaves philosophy, current politics and existentialism into the class. We studied Freud, watched films like Momento and Waking Life and analyzed the Onion once a week.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class discussions were intriguing.  His discussion topic (focused on the first amendment) stimulates profound thought...awesome class for those who like to study politics -but a tough grader so be aware</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't recomend him unless you enjoy talking about censorship everyday.

If you wanted to participate this was the class to do so. Lots of arguments and challenging writing. If you try, you can get a B, and if you just argue you can get a C. He is very involved with political subjects</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE IS A VERY INTERESTING TEACHER, HE LIKES YOU TO BE INVOLVED IN THE DEBATES. HE DOESNT REALLY EXPLAIN PAPERS TO WELL, NOT VERY CLEAR ON WHAT HE WANTS, HE USUALLY SPENDS HIS CLASS DOING NOTHING EXCEPT &quot;ONLINE RESEARCH HELP&quot; THAT IS IF HE IS IN C</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good solid teacher focused on our rights. Brings argumentative ideas to the paper that fuel thought and the want to write with passion on an interesting topic. Political and argumaentative. If you don't like to participate, don't like to argue, bad class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a great teacher if. he lets you turn in a paper late by a couple days without a penalty who ever rated him must have done something wrong because he is very good</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2003<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>QUITE POSSIBLY THE WORST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD!!

He's nearly obssessed with first amendment rights.  He caters to stupid people, so if you know what subjuntive phrases and semicolons are you may be frustrated with the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2003<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2003<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an interesting and understanding teacher but, he is very vague about what he wants on papers.
