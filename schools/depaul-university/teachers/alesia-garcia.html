Shes very interesting, but I think only Latinos can understand her because of her background and the way she teaches.She misses class frequently, but who cares&#63;She encourages class discussion and loves when the class partcipates.Shes not boring and assigns interseting readings</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the worst professor here at Depaul!  She is extremely rude, disrespectful, irresponsible, and unprofessional.  She missed like 3 weeks of class.  She was absolutely cruel to one of the students, and I was furious.  DO NOT take her class, avoid it at all costs.  I better get an 'A'.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2006<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to get your money's worth, she is not the one to provide a class of substance. She's leaving so she does not care about anything but that.Wait until she leaves to take the classes she offers.People may think it's cute that she missed like 3 weeks worth of classes, but it's not for those of us who want a genuine education.I expect an A!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2006<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID HER. She doesn't care about teaching English, she only cares about hating DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2005<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST TEACHER EVER!! she makes you feel extremly stupid and is just not a nice person. she is a horrible teacher and never comes to class or is always late. she plays favorites and if you are not one then that suuuucks. her lectures are boring and extremely hard to follow. she is really just a total b*tch. thank you</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2005<br>Class Name: AMINDLIT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst English class I took at DePaul.  She seems like she has no real knowledge of anything she talks about, and in fact, makes students do presentations on all the books to teach you the things she cannot.  She seemed, to me, to be unfair, favoring those students who participated all of the time over others.  She was not understanding of illnesses that caused absences.  Definitely not worth the money that the class would cost you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2005<br>Class Name: ENG373<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't tell you what she wants on the papers. Midterm was worth 15% of total grade while participation and attendance were worth a combined 45% WTF&#63; Seeing that there are only two graded assignments in the entire class, this makes little to no sense. Still, the class is easy for what it is if you give her what she wants.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman was habitually late to class every day. It got really annoying, and she was in a bad mood a lot of the time.  But she did have her good moments, and the reading was easy and pretty interesting.  She plays favorites (usually the most stuck up of the English kids). Recommend her for ISP.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome teacher!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2005<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken two of her classes and she's great. If you like reading novels and than talking about the books you read, its a fun and easy class. Its basically like joing a bookclub. There is no hw, other than the reading. She's really relaxed and cool. I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a good teacher.

Not only did she have tons of reading, but the material was boaring. When I tried to find time to meet with her, it was like scheduling a meeting with the president. Stay away from her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2004<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher and brings diversity to DePaul.  She is a teacher who truly wants you to do well in her class and will make herself available to ensure that this happens.  If get the opportunity take her.  Plus, her book selection is awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2004<br>Class Name: ENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice and smart.

I have learned so much from this class in only a few weeks!  I tell all of my friends to take her classes.

She chose some great books and we had very good discussions, though! Overall, not the worst, but not the best.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! The class (Women Writers of Color) was very interesting. She chose a few really good books to read and discuss in the class.  Test weren't hard and she graded easier on students who participated in the discussions.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
