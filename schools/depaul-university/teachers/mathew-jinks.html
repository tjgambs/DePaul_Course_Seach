Wether you are a photography major or non major you will benifit from his class. Very understanding and makes class interesting! I took him in the summer, but he made those 3 hours fly by pretty quickly with interesting lectures and hands on methods of teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2014<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very relaxed professor who really makes you want to learn photography.

Regardless of the amount of effort you put in, you'll get at least a &quot;B&quot; on the 4 projects you'll have (including final). Laid-back, at times almost boring. If you're having trouble with anything just go talk to him. Easy on the eyes, and his British accent doesn't hurt.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2009<br>Class Name: DCM105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i loved the class and the man what can i say</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really cool British guy.
