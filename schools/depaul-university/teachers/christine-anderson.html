I'm not good at math, so I always prefer a good teacher when it comes to math. Tests were ridiculously long, and cover way too much content.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2008<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the nicest profs I've had here. The tests are easy if you study. I did not take very many class notes and I received an A because I used the study guides! She also gives lots of extra credit opportunities and is very understanding. Great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: PSYC240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible prof. Speeds through lectures, does not explain examples.Dont bother asking for help, shes useless.She'll end up confusing more. The final is hell!! DONT TAKE HER, UNLESS YOU WANT TO RE-PAY FOR THIS CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: PSY351<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not a good instructor. Doesnt seem to know what shes lecturing.  The entire qrt spent reading from her notes rather than lecturing.  Dont take her if you care about ur GPA!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2008<br>Class Name: PSY351<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>only a final and midterm but tests are extremely difficult, and take the whole class period to complete! you MUST read the book! a lot of lecture, but thankfully no powerpoint. little homework, one final paper (which is a tough). the final is brutal!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2008<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was an alright teacher. Just a bunch of lecturing. If I hadn't learned the information in a prior course, I wouldn't have learned it in this class. Make sure that you study!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2008<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got a good grade, but I don’t think she was a great teacher. Other than a few 5 min activities the whole class is based on taking notes and nothing more. She assigns a lot of reading and she goes over the material rather quickly. She also rarely stops to explain it. The quizzes and tests are hard if you don’t study.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2007<br>Class Name: PSY101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst De Paul has to offer!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2007<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is awesome.  everything that she teaches is really relevant.  she gives a lot of chances for extra credit, and not very much homework.  if you study, the tests and quizzes will be easy.  TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this is NOT the class that you think it will be. Must read 100 pages of the book a week and research/present with a group weekly on different topics. doesnt really have to do with vampires AT ALL. professor was batty and late for final by a half an hour. take a diff. focal point - do not waste your time with this one.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class, great teacher, great material  . Had a really good time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2007<br>Class Name: STATPSY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Possibly the nicest and most understanding professor I have ever met. However, she cant teach stats. She moved VERY fast and the lectures were unclear. The tests were very long and overly tedious, but relevant to coursework. Helpful daily homework, attendance not mandatory but you will fail if you dont go because the class moves too fast.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had her for focal point. Very nice woman, well thought out lesson plans that tie a lot of material into her subject of Vampires. We went through sexuality, religion, cults, and family/psychology as it relates to the novel read in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>loved her! she is so great and is very understanding. i got an A and was very happy with the way she tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, so I love psychology, it's my major, but at times I felt like i knew more about it than she did.  don't get me wrong she's really nice & teaches the course really well... but yeah.  Also, if you aren't 1 who likes lectures, & gets sleepy easy, then like me you might be sleep. EVERY SINGLE DAY. I managed to pull of an A- & slept thru 90% of it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. A. is an excellent prof.She is has the experience needed to teach the class and makes it soo fun.We talk about each other experience and applied them to the lecture.THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST PSYCH CLASS EVER.I never fell asleep. Just READ ur notes & book when assigned and u'll do fine. U'll have a few quizzes, but they help for midterm and final!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
