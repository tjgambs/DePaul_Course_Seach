He is an expert in his field, brings in interesting speakers, and - above all - he respects his students.  He shows this respect by providing quality teaching, asking for feedback, encouraging participation, and challenging you to think like an economist.  I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2013<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXCELLENT "teacher", not simply lecturing throughout classes, teaching concepts and applying those concepts to individuals' professional work experience.

He "demonstrates" examples on the boar, but it's all just scribbles. Also, he rushes through everything and expects you to learn it all. I wish I could have dropped this class, but it seemed like an easy and interesting class the first 2 weeks. :( .</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2013<br>Class Name: ECO361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him as my Global Perspective class at DePaul.

He related content to real world, Showed necessary work for solving problems (even did calc review for half a class), was interesting to listen to.  My one beef is that on the first exam, half of the class didn't finish in the time allowed, yet he did not curve the exam. If you like ECON, you'll learn a lot</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2011<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very fair teacher.
