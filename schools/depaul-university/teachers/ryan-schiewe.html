He likes to joke and he tries to make class fun.  You can have fun with projects, but they take time.  It's college, deal with it, but it takes less time than writing papers.  Fun class, fantastic teacher.  All lectures posted online.  If you miss class, just e-mail him.  Very easy grading.  Highly recommend!! **</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ryan is extremely patient and very careful about explaining how to create the projects. Over all he's just a super nice guy and very talented. I'd highly recommend the class, but just take it seriously. If you actually try, you'll do fine. You're afforded full creativity as well in your projects.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2007<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a pretty down to earth professor. I really enjoyed the class, being a poli sci major, you rarely get to enjoy something like this. The projects are not too difficult and the class is just a blast.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2007<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you are not used to using a MAC and after effect/photoshop this class can be challenging but still fun. The 5 sec animation may take 2 or 3 hours to do but the class is still fun. If you are willing to spend alot of time and have patience then this class is for you otherwise dont take it. Ryan is an OKAY teacher he could explain better</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2007<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was useless in helping me and mean to me when I missed a class. Not helpful, and found him very snarky not good at teaching material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2007<br>Class Name: ANI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ryan is pretty much excellent. and you should probably take him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2007<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2007<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ryan was really a great professor. He makes sure that you know what you're doing, and is always willing to help. He definately knows what he's talking about, and is definately worth taking!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: ANI100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really cool, extremely helpful and patient. Some stuff might be a bit difficult if you're not used to the programs.. but it's definitely an interesting class to take, especially if you are just looking for one to fill an arts & lit. credit. I reccomend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2007<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really Great guy and willing to help with any problems you will have; if any.  Just make sure not to fall behind with small papers and assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2007<br>Class Name: ANI105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very relaxed, easy class! During each class, Ryan will go over student work and make comments (mostly supportive), introduce the next assignment, and might show art that is relevant to the topic of the day. The assignments didn't take long to finish. Art skills aren't required.   If you're a serious animator, this class might be a waste of time.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
