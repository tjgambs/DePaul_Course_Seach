You'll look around the room 4 weeks into the quarter and realized that about 20-30% of your fellow students have dropped the class. It's CFA level hardness for undergraduate level experience. Its just not necessary. Save yourself some hardship.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2014<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Save your money and take this class with someone else.  He is very hard and has little sympathy for his students.  In truth you will have to teach yourself so take another teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2014<br>Class Name: FIN33<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Yes you absolutely have to study your butt off, but it is absolutely work it. I took the class during the winter quarter. He is a great teacher, does cover a lot but finance is supposed to be hard, especially investments! If you want to learn a lot and maximize your education, take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>He's not THAT bad.  I've had better Finance professors, but I've also had worse.  You have to do all the online homework and quizzes or you'll never pass.  He also assigns problems from the back of the book, but never checks if you actually do it.  You should do those problems anyway, because you'll see them on the exams, sometimes verbatim.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quite possibly the worst teacher I have ever had at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2014<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have mixed feelings about him. He is a nice guy but awfully disorganized. I get the feeling that he comes to class with no idea of what he's got to teach. He just reads the slides to you and then tests you on every single MFL problem. It wouldn't be an issue had he told us so ahead of the exam. Basically, you'll be teaching yourself this quarter</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2014<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I chose to ignore the comments here and I am paying for this dearly. He is a likable buy but disorganized, and because he talks nonsense, he wastes time in class, which means we wind up teaching ourselves. Often we can only get to do the hw by having taught ourselves the material as we never get to cover all of it in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY from this guy. Try to teach off powerpoints, which means he talks through problems instead of show you how to do them. Class is showing problem on slide, asking you to figure it out, the when the one kid in the room has the right answer he says, how'd you get that? Not actually teaching anything. Tests: HARD. He gives no partial credit.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not recommend taking this professor for Fin330. If he had a more strategic teaching style, I would be more gracious with his score. His tests are under a time constraint and reward fast test-takers. If you're stuck taking him, don't take 5 classes that term because you will need the extra time to learn the material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy. 2 midterms, final, & HW. Each 1/4 grade. Got an A-. You need to READ THE BOOK & use all of the online resources which includes the HW. If you don't do both, you won't pass the exams. The exams are challenging, need to manage your time. If your an independent student I recommend this class. Reading the slide notes alone won't be enough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is a hard class and he makes it even worse. His grading is usually unfair and makes mistakes most of the time. Take different professor if it is possible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly suggest you select a different professor for this class. He is a nice guy but you won't learn anything in his class. You will have to teach yourself everything and read the book thoroughly (not easy). He doesn't prepare you for the exams whatsoever. I absolutely regret taking his class. Choose a different professor for this class, trust me!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Necessary things to know BEFORE taking:  stats, CAPM, bond pricing.  If you were paying attention in your fin 310/311 you shouldn't have an issue.  I would recommend taking this course and risk management at the same time since so many topics overlap.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy just assumes you know everything and he will say that at least twice every class. Your only hope of passing his class is by reading the book, understanding it on your own, and doing the problems. His method of teaching is a complete joke.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I've ever had, period. I usually don't pay attention to these comments and go into the class open minded about the professor but I advise you not to pick him. Delay the class a quarter if you have the chance. Does not teach you much and expects you to know everything. Tests are extremely long and impossible to do well on.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! He is a great guy but the worst professor I ever got a DePaul! The midterms and finals are the hardest I have ever taken!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst Finance professor I have ever had at DePaul. Do not take him. I am really positive that you will regret it. There are two midterms and final. The exams are difficult but the given time makes it worse. He assumes that you know everything. He seemed really knowledgeable about the subject but does not know how to teach well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard class but he makes it even harder. I got an A in 310 and even with a lot of study time its impossible to get an A in this class. 2 midterms and a final. The class is not bad but his tests are the hardest thing ever. Little time to finish and a lot of problems. It just feels like he covers too much materials.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER! He doesn't teach you anything, just assumes you should know everything prior to him even going over it, and when he does go over stuff in class he just flies through the material. Again DO NOT TAKE HIM! You will regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2014<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Fisher is one of the best finance professors at DePaul. He really makes the material understandable conceptually.  Make sure you do the HW and go to class and you should be able to get, at the very least, a B.  Professor Fisher is also always willing and encourages to meet for extra help.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attndnce: You should go to class. Otherwise, you can't blame him for a low grade. Great professor. Invites every single person to come to office hours OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Don't believe the low ratings. I asked my older brother and he gave me the recommendation. Take if you want to get a job after college. Friendly and cool.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would advocate taking this course with another professor, if possible.  He was not able to answer difficult questions asked by the class and often stumbled over the material.  Personally, he is a nice enough guy, but I do feel that he has a lot  of room for improvement as a professor.  You'll just teach yourself with the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2013<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy but awful class. Problem is that the hw assignments were almost always one chapter ahead of in-class lecture. Essentially, MBA students paid $3700 to teach themselves Corporate Finance (from a very reasonably priced $287 book) by completing the graded hw before actually learning the lesson/concepts from the professor. The final was brutal.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2013<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of people hate on this guy, but honestly I think he's a solid professor. I managed to get a 50% on the final, but still pulled away with a C+. First grade below a A- for Finance classes (DePaul Finance is kind of joke). Anyway that was my fault not his, I should have tried. Just put in SOME kind of effort and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2013<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS GUY!! Basically Fisher expects his students to know everything while teaching as little as possible. He has had a lot of past experiences in the field of finance but it does not translate over to good teaching. You take two midterms and a final; about 40% of the class passed. Also, he's very arrogant and unhelpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Why all the bad commons? I took him for 2 classes, FIN 310 and Entrepreneurship,  and they turned out great.

Do NOT take a class with him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is not helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guys sucks.
