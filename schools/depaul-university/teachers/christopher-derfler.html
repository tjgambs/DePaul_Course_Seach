So boring. It's week 4 and we've only just now opened up the program for editing. He doesn't know the program either. He spends half the class trying to learn it himself. BEWARE. Also, isn't nice about being 1 minute late. BEWARE. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. I"M TRYING TO HELP YOU.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2013<br>Class Name: DC320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Derfler is ultra-easy, but still very helpful. He errs more on the FCP side which is slowly losing traction as editing software, so you may have some tension with that. However, he offers a great way to organize oneself to work as a professional editor. Plus, he has a great deal of experience you can question him on!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2011<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The other two comments sound like him! Ok, so this class is..OK. If you are familiar with Final Cut then TAKE THIS CLASS it will be an easy A. As a professor, he plays favorites, at times treats you like you are in high school-annoying! Attendance is mandatory, can't be 1 min late hmm no quiz, midterm (usually curves it), and final is a project.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2011<br>Class Name: DC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor, very knowledgeable about the material and industry, and enthusiastic to teach to others. Communicated the project due dates as deadlines are in the real world, which is a big plus in getting students prepared for actual industry projects. Pushes the importance of time management and organizational skills, which is huge.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2009<br>Class Name: DC210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. Expert in his craft and extremely helpful to those who care about the class. Ties life philosophy into his teaching, which makes the class enjoyable, and about more than just film.  Strongly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2009<br>Class Name: PROD2<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he was a good teacher. Sometimes he's a little bit hard to follow, but I learned a lot in his class. The comment posted before seems completely unfounded. Sounds more like a personal grudge than an actual rating.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
