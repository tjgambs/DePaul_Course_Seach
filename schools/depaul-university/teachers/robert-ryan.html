			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

I would definitely recommend him if you're not the best at accounting. Makes everything clear, and encourages you to do well. Homework isn't necessary but a must do to better understand. Take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2015<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a great professor. He puts you on the spot and makes everyone stay on their toes with learning the material. Lectures always seem to go by quickly and students have a good time in class cuz the guy's hilarious. He makes you work hard but gives you encouragement and a good reason to do well. Assignments are not graded but essential </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2014<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! I never got a B in my life and ended up getting a B in his class. Lectures were boring and his test is not based on lecture. Might be better off just stay at home and read the textbook. 1 page of notes allowed on midterm and final. One group project.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear and helpful. Very nice notes and class questions. Quizzes are helpful and he wants his students to succeed. One of the best and most fun teachers I've had.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TAKING THIS PROFESSOR. He's extremely unhelpful and very ambiguous about the class expectations. He makes you feel stupid for asking questions or if you don't understand something. He expects you to know everything before he has taught it to you. He just has all-around negative energy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I have had at DePaul! He uses a lot of real-life examples from his wide background in accounting and finance, which makes the class interesting. Takes a lot of time going over problems that will be on tests. Very personable, very helpful if you need it. Really wants his students to do well and he makes it easy to do so.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2013<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very strict, and does not seem very personable at all. I did learn a lot, but everything he taught me was not on his final. If he did not try to trick students so often he would be great, but he does, so I do not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2012<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a horrible prof. very unclear during lectures, he thinks he is funny, when in reality its a waste of time to even attend his class.. but he makes you since he gives you pop quizzes that are 20% of your grade and are extremely hard.. I do NOT recommend taking this course at all, it will just confuse the hell out of you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2012<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ryan is an awesome teacher. He was one of the only professor's that I liked to listen to and enjoyed him as my teacher. He is a tough grader, but prepares you well for the midterm and final. They were much easier than his tests. Listen in class and do what he says and you will get an A! Awesome guy and I can't wait to take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great professor who took all the time his students needed.  We did countless practice problems, and he told us exactly what would and would not be tested.  Exams were easier than the quizzes and practice problems from class.  Students did not do HW and talked during lecture, not his fault!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2012<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to feel hopeless and confused, then take him. I felt his unclarity and confusing lectures made the course material a lot more difficult to understand and comprehend. He doesn't lecture.  Classtime is spent going over homework problems that he'll twist and turn to confuse you even more.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I recommend taking him since he teaches clearly and ensures you understand the material. Quizzes and test are a tad difficult, but manageable if you study hard plus he drops 2 of your quizzes. he calls out on you so be prepared to provide an answer. attendance also mandatory</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ryan is a great professor. He will answer questions and go over homework as long as people have questions. Took him for 310 as well. Tests are exactly what you go over for HW. However, he will through in 1 or 2 challenging questions per test that go above and beyond the material.One of the best profs if you're a finance major.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2011<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very knowledgeable but  does not know how to teach.

Anyone who says he isn't just didn't understand the material...and that's fine. It is a tough course, but his tests are EXACTLY what you learn in class. If he didn't mention it its not on the test, and if it is he grades it ridiculously lenient even though you should know it. I loved having him. Very knowledgeable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked Prof. Ryan.  At first, he is very intimidating because he knows what he is talking about and will call you out.  But with that being said, you do need to do the work he assigns and study your butt off because, at least for me, accounting didn't come easy.  If you ask for help and show that you care, he will help you out!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2011<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There will be two unannounced pop quizzes  1ST QUIZ ON RATIO 2ND PROBLEM SOLVE; each worth 10% of the final grade; a REALLY HARD midterm exam worth 35% of the final grade ; an other HARD scheduled exam in the second half of class worth 30% of the final grade; and SUPER HARD final exam worth 15% of the final grade.

He knows a lot, I give him a credit for that, but unfortunately he does not know how to teach. Sometimes makes mistakes while explaining problems. He is very arrogant and self centered. Talks about BS, his sons, how great he is, and that Apple is THE place to work. Skips a lot of info thats important.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you don't know finance, then this class will be tough. He expects you to know your stuff, and he can be very unclear when he lectures. No H/W due, just quizzes and tests. Did better than expected because he can be lenient with grading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ryan, is a very lenient grader.  Midterm is tough, but prepares you for the rest of the class.  Show up ask questions about the homework if you don't understand it, he goes through materials at a fast pace.  He does get a little side tracked at times. Overall a better finance instructor than the previous ones I had.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not that bad, his tests are little tricky but if you know the concept, you will be fine on the tests.

Hated the class when i was in it may have made me grey, but the hard work forces you to learn and is VERY helpful in later classes.

If you're majoring in Finance take him, he makes you learn instead of just giving the answers. Aplia, Textbook Homework, 2 Quizzes, and a Final. Really cool guy if you just participate in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor has no idea what is going on.. I admit that the quizzes and tests were fairly simple. But the hours spent in class are essentially a waste of life. Most of it is spent on MSN and Yahoo Finance searching useless that doesn't apply to life.

He will let you struggle and then not tell you the correct way to work a problem.  It actually worked because it forced you to read and learn the material.  Will throw difficult and extensive problems that you have hd no exposure to in class on every exam but ends up giving you more points than deserved.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ryan is extremely knowledgeable in his field. His exams are not that easy, but if you did and understood homework then it should be easy. He's quite a funny guy at times, and is not as intimidating as he seems.

Have to do the homework but if you know how to do the homework you will be good for the exams.  No need for a book because he uses powerpoint for his presentations.

Has a sense of humor, but you wont notice that until a few weeks into the course. Read the book and do all of your homework before class! He is not a hard grader and he does have a small grading curve.

He starts off a little slower to get everyone comfortable with the basic concepts, then speeds it up towards the end. If you pay attention, take notes, and do the homework you'll do just fine.

There are two quizzes, midterm, and final exam. If you understand how to do homework problems, you will not be more than fine on quizzes or exams.
