Always available if you need help. Tests are hard, but a lot of the time you have seen something on the test in the homework. Go to class to understand what he is talking about. Really enjoyed class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2015<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've had by far. I would definitely recommend him if you're not the best at accounting. Makes everything clear, and encourages you to do well. Homework isn't necessary but a must do to better understand. Take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2015<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a great professor. He puts you on the spot and makes everyone stay on their toes with learning the material. Lectures always seem to go by quickly and students have a good time in class cuz the guy's hilarious. He makes you work hard but gives you encouragement and a good reason to do well. Assignments are not graded but essential </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2014<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! I never got a B in my life and ended up getting a B in his class. Lectures were boring and his test is not based on lecture. Might be better off just stay at home and read the textbook. 1 page of notes allowed on midterm and final. One group project.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear and helpful. Very nice notes and class questions. Quizzes are helpful and he wants his students to succeed. One of the best and most fun teachers I've had.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TAKING THIS PROFESSOR. He's extremely unhelpful and very ambiguous about the class expectations. He makes you feel stupid for asking questions or if you don't understand something. He expects you to know everything before he has taught it to you. He just has all-around negative energy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I have had at DePaul! He uses a lot of real-life examples from his wide background in accounting and finance, which makes the class interesting. Takes a lot of time going over problems that will be on tests. Very personable, very helpful if you need it. Really wants his students to do well and he makes it easy to do so.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2013<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very strict, and does not seem very personable at all. I did learn a lot, but everything he taught me was not on his final. If he did not try to trick students so often he would be great, but he does, so I do not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2012<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a horrible prof. very unclear during lectures, he thinks he is funny, when in reality its a waste of time to even attend his class.. but he makes you since he gives you pop quizzes that are 20% of your grade and are extremely hard.. I do NOT recommend taking this course at all, it will just confuse the hell out of you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2012<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ryan is an awesome teacher. He was one of the only professor's that I liked to listen to and enjoyed him as my teacher. He is a tough grader, but prepares you well for the midterm and final. They were much easier than his tests. Listen in class and do what he says and you will get an A! Awesome guy and I can't wait to take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great professor who took all the time his students needed.  We did countless practice problems, and he told us exactly what would and would not be tested.  Exams were easier than the quizzes and practice problems from class.  Students did not do HW and talked during lecture, not his fault!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2012<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to feel hopeless and confused, then take him. I felt his unclarity and confusing lectures made the course material a lot more difficult to understand and comprehend. He doesn't lecture.  Classtime is spent going over homework problems that he'll twist and turn to confuse you even more.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I recommend taking him since he teaches clearly and ensures you understand the material. Quizzes and test are a tad difficult, but manageable if you study hard plus he drops 2 of your quizzes. he calls out on you so be prepared to provide an answer. attendance also mandatory</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ryan is a great professor. He will answer questions and go over homework as long as people have questions. Took him for 310 as well. Tests are exactly what you go over for HW. However, he will through in 1 or 2 challenging questions per test that go above and beyond the material.One of the best profs if you're a finance major.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2011<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very knowledgeable but  does not know how to teach. Take someone else if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher. You will have to work in his class, but since he doesnt spoon  feed you the answers, you actually will learn. If you want a bit of a challenge take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Ryan is a great professor. Anyone who says he isn't just didn't understand the material...and that's fine. It is a tough course, but his tests are EXACTLY what you learn in class. If he didn't mention it its not on the test, and if it is he grades it ridiculously lenient even though you should know it. I loved having him. Very knowledgeable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked Prof. Ryan.  At first, he is very intimidating because he knows what he is talking about and will call you out.  But with that being said, you do need to do the work he assigns and study your butt off because, at least for me, accounting didn't come easy.  If you ask for help and show that you care, he will help you out!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2011<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There will be two unannounced pop quizzes  1ST QUIZ ON RATIO 2ND PROBLEM SOLVE; each worth 10% of the final grade; a REALLY HARD midterm exam worth 35% of the final grade ; an other HARD scheduled exam in the second half of class worth 30% of the final grade; and SUPER HARD final exam worth 15% of the final grade. Does not explain well!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very unorganized and very unclear. He knows a lot, I give him a credit for that, but unfortunately he does not know how to teach. Sometimes makes mistakes while explaining problems. He is very arrogant and self centered. Talks about BS, his sons, how great he is, and that Apple is THE place to work. Skips a lot of info thats important.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you don't know finance, then this class will be tough. He expects you to know your stuff, and he can be very unclear when he lectures. No H/W due, just quizzes and tests. Did better than expected because he can be lenient with grading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ryan, is a very lenient grader.  Midterm is tough, but prepares you for the rest of the class.  Show up ask questions about the homework if you don't understand it, he goes through materials at a fast pace.  He does get a little side tracked at times. Overall a better finance instructor than the previous ones I had.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not that bad, his tests are little tricky but if you know the concept, you will be fine on the tests. Do the homework and take notes in the class, I got As on his FIN 310 and 311</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2010<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is worthless.  Accused me of cheating and made me sit in front of the class so he could look over my shoulder like a 3rd grader.  I still received a 100%, but no thanks to Ryan.  He's a dean now and does not reply to emails.  Way to go DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very bad teacher, Lectures Unclear,Midterm is crazy hard, refuses to answer all questions , Most likely I will get a c+ or -B. Didn't learn anything.Half way through the class period (90min) he is finished with the lecture and wastes time on preaching on the stuff you will not need for the test instead of solving problems which will kill your grade</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this teacher is bad.  he flirts with the girls in a creepy way.  he is very unorganized and is never prepared for class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2009<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He will teach you how NOT to solve problems rather than how to solve them. Makes constant mistakes when going through problems and covers them up by saying &quot;well thats not right now is it&quot; as if it was intended. Bad professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2009<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ryan is very good at what he does - he definitely understands Financial Accounting and tries to incorporate what is currently happening in the business world into his lectures.  He is tough though.  I would not take this course during summer - very fast paced.  Overall, I would probably take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super hard forces you to learn but it pays off in the long run. Hated the class when i was in it may have made me grey, but the hard work forces you to learn and is VERY helpful in later classes. If you show your trying and see him in his office he may give u some**** but its helpful and stuff he has already done in class so he is allowed to</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to learn about finance DO NOT take him. He is horrible and doesn't know how to teach. He is extremely difficult. If you go to his office for help, he would insult you and may make you cry. I really don't recommend this teacher. This whole past quarter was a big tourcher to me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of people say that this professor is difficult or horrible but it really depends on what major you're in. If you're majoring in Finance take him, he makes you learn instead of just giving the answers. Aplia, Textbook Homework, 2 Quizzes, and a Final. Really cool guy if you just participate in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor has no idea what is going on.. I admit that the quizzes and tests were fairly simple. But the hours spent in class are essentially a waste of life. Most of it is spent on MSN and Yahoo Finance searching useless that doesn't apply to life. If you reach out for help, he acts like he's doing a favor on you for helping.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of the homwork given are not even on the quizzes, but most of the questions are related to material taught in class. The final was essentially all previous quiz questions and some new material. Made the class think rather than give away the answers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests are extermely hard! The class average for the second quiz was a 59%. You basically have to teach yourself, because he makes absolutley no sense. HW is way easier than the quizes and tests. Don't take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is really over rated, he changed all his test and they are really hard now, he doesnt ask any thing from text avoid taking his class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy.

If you are a Finance Major take him. He prepares you very nicely to what is yet to come. If you understand the homework, you will do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exams are really hard. Study alot expecially all the homework problems, those help alot. Try not skipping class because you'll miss alot. I recommend this class if you're a Finance major.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2008<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ryan is a descent man.  He is an above average professor however will not give you the obvious answer to a question if you are struglling.  Overall, I recommend him for ACC 500</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Little work load.

Ryan is not very clear, so be prepared to teach yourself. Buy the study guide, we called it &quot;the Bible&quot;. first quiz and second test are the hardest!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting method of teaching. He will let you struggle and then not tell you the correct way to work a problem.  It actually worked because it forced you to read and learn the material.  Will throw difficult and extensive problems that you have hd no exposure to in class on every exam but ends up giving you more points than deserved.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ryan is extremely knowledgeable in his field. His exams are not that easy, but if you did and understood homework then it should be easy. He's quite a funny guy at times, and is not as intimidating as he seems.  Thoroughly enjoyed his class and I also learned a lot.  Take him over Berry if you really want to learn something about finance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2007<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He know's what he is talking about, but does not teach it very well. Many times left people confused about the best way to do a problem. You almost need to know the whole subject already before you can start to understand his teaching. If you are going to take him, make sure you spend a lot of time completing the homework before he teaches it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There r 2 RR at depaul, one for acct and one for finance! i am not sure if ppl r mixing them up. FOR FINANCE i did not find him very easy, it was hard for me to understand wha he is saying..i didnt even bother i left after break! just read the book! he is helpful but confusing! take thomas berry for FIN 310!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  Have to do the homework but if you know how to do the homework you will be good for the exams.  No need for a book because he uses powerpoint for his presentations.

Take him you will learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first he comes off as a jerk, but he is actually more than willing to help and VERY knowledgeable about the finance industry. Has a sense of humor, but you wont notice that until a few weeks into the course. Read the book and do all of your homework before class! He is not a hard grader and he does have a small grading curve. He has a cute butt!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2007<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of DePaul's very best: very knowledgeable, focused, significant experience, and knows how to teach. He expects students to read the material and be prepared for a seminar format class: he calls on everyone each week to answer an open-ended question. He has high standards and if you do the work, you'll learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor.

If you know how to do the HW problems and test examples, you'll be fine. Also, get a study guide (really helpful).He's goofy in a geeky kind of way- which is actually cute :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Despite having an accounting phobia, I got through this class just fine. He starts off a little slower to get everyone comfortable with the basic concepts, then speeds it up towards the end. If you pay attention, take notes, and do the homework you'll do just fine.  Final paper was actually kind of fun to do. Great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ryan is the best finance professor at Depaul and he is smokin HOTTTT!!!If only he wasn't married :(</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For people who are not good with finance I would not suggest this teacher.  Nothing is done on the board so it is hard to really know visually what he is talking about- He just stands there and talks.  Before you know it he completed a complex lesson and you don't know what happened.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His teaching style takes some getting used to. I haven't had a favorable impression of him at first, but over time I had to change my opinion. He is definitely an EXCELLENT professor. I give him an A for his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Homework is collected but not graded. There are two quizzes, midterm, and final exam. If you understand how to do homework problems, you will not be more than fine on quizzes or exams. The book is not helpful but he posts his lectures’ notes on blackboard. Study from them and you will get A, B+ easily. He curves at the end.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2005<br>Class Name: 310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you do the homework problems and understand them you will be more than fine.  He basically takes problems he does in class and the homework problems and puts them on the test.  He rambles once in a while, but not too hard just do the work</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very good prof. once u get used to his style of teaching. He makes you think instead of just hanfeeding you the material.  He does not curve, but if you do all of the homework, read the book and pay attention to his lectures you can earn an A.  Definitely not an easy class and he does not portray it to be.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm a finance major im glad i took him because he does know alot but he cant really teach that well. HE rambles in class about g-d knows what and just confuses people. Be prepeared to bring in the wallstreet journal everyday and discuss it because it shows up on the midterm. Intresting topic but not the best professor for explaing material</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2005<br>Class Name: FIN<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the man thinks he's funny, and he's not. He doesn't teach, just confuses people more. He always makes mistakes, and his pre quizzes are not like the quiz or test.  I think the people who are doing that well are just the nerds who have nothing better to do, but memorize the damn book. Take Berry much easier</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is an awesome teacher.  Not only does he give you real-life examples, but makes the class fun.  For all the dumba$$e$ who took him and did bad, guess what, you might need to consider working a bit harder, because the teacher outlines test and quiz questions.  The rest is hw and showing up to class.  If you cant follow that, give up on life</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor! Explains things well.  Gives practice problems for quizes and exams.  Not hard to get an A, just do ur hw.  I recommend him if you want to major in finance.  Cuz u ll learn a LOT!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101AND102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the guy is lazy and sucks! stay away got a d+</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what these people are talking about...if you just do the homework and read his notes you will get an A, no question.

He instead skims topics, forgets formulas, tease the slower students. He is overall an terrible teacher. Why don't u save the $1,800.00 for the class and teach urself, because essentially that's what u will do.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not easy to follow, he's in his own little world sometimes.  He's a bad teacher but he &quot;knows&quot; what hes talking about.  His midterms and finals are very straight forward cause he give you practice ones that are identical to his the exams</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST professor!!!!!  He tells you exactly what you need to know for the quizzes and exams.  I got a 100% on the first quiz.  He is very clear.  He makes you do the calculations which are relatively easy and uses real world examples.  Make sure you do the homework and you'll get an &quot;A.&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's cocky to say the less. Then he requires that you purchase the wall street journal, what a waste. In class he totally surfs the internet looking for real world things, and spends little to no time going over what's important and what he'll put on the midterm or final. I would not take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2004<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the kind of person you would want to work for.  He does a great job of explaining complicated financial information and makes sure everyone understands it.  I learned a lot from this class and would recommend him as a great teacher to everyone!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE BEST TEACHER AT DEPAUL! i mean the guy gives us practice quizzes(w/ ans.)before midterm and final!! he is easy to follow IF YOU DO THE HOMEWORK-w/c is easy is you read the book and his notes! easy A! gotta know math, that's it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you do the homework and copy all the notes in your calculator, this class is a breeeeeeeeeeeze!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the guy you want to go talk about real world.  I mean he condenses what is important from the 40+ pg chapter into 3-4 pages. We look at the WSJ and look at how concepts in the book apply. It was my first finance class, but I loved every bit of it.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
