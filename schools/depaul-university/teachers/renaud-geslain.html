Very clear and concise. Posts all powerpoints. Tries to help you in any way, shape or form. Very understanding; if, for any reason, you turn in homework late, he is forgiving and will not dock you any points. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2012<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated BIO until I took this class. Prof is great and takes interest in his students, his accent can be a little hard to understand at times but it was tolerable. Take good notes and study for the three tests and you will do fine. I am am not a bio major and I found the class to be an easy A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: BIO220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So fun listening to him lecture with his French accent.  Could be thick at times but never was a problem for understanding.  Lighthearted and has a very interesting bio background.  He honestly knows A LOT about the subject  Definitely a hidden gem in the bio dept.  For those that care: it's a pretty easy A (~3.9 student)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2012<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I most definately recommend this professor. He explained everything crystal clear and when you do not understand something he will go back and give a full explanation. Overall, very nice professor and he is most definately one the best I have had so far.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2012<br>Class Name: BIO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a good professor, and he's always willing to help you succeed.
