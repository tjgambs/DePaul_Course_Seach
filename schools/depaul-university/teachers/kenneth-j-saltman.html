Changed my entire thought process about equity and education. If you don't like a challenge, don't take this course. Give him a chance-- he may not be the most engaging teacher, but he is spot on with his critiques of Edu & society. Don't hate just because you don't understand the material.

You have a TON of readings per week and some of the readings are interesting and pertain to education, but others are so hard to comprehend and leaves you wondering how it has to do with teaching.

I took it as an elective in my doctoral program, and it was absolutely the worst class in my academic career. All  he  does is promote his socialist ideology, which can be very offensive. You will get a lower grade unless you agree with him. DePaul should pay attention to the students' reviews.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A tough, tough, tough teacher. He is extremely knowledgeable but I'm not sure he should be teaching this class to undergrads. The course, readings, and discussion were all super hard to follow. If you're doing education, take this course later in your career. Too hard for freshmen and sophomores to comprehend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2011<br>Class Name: EDU408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

The class is CLEARLY about exposing the larger issues attacking education, and again, people just don't want to see the truth.  Ignorance is bliss kind of thing.  Those who speak the truth are often hated the most.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2009<br>Class Name: SCG409<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof is really confusing and acts way above your intelligence level, but I still participated as much as possible, and he totally screwed me over with a final grade. You have no idea what you're getting in the class until it's too late. He gives no feedback throughout. I would not recommend this class to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great course, great prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intelligent, but clearly uninterested in the fundamentals of this course. Very little practical, or even theoretical, relevance to education.  Some of the articles/books we had to read were such a stretch, he couldn't even explain the link.  We did get out early every class.  DePaul needs to change the course description to pointless waste.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Saltman is a really smart guy, but honestly his class is really boring. You are required to reading excerpts from books that he wants you to &quot;suffer&quot; through. There was very little class discussion, it pretty much was him talking. The mid-term and final are really tedious. He lets you out early everytime 4 a nite class. Meh!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do NOT take this professor unless you enjoy reading ridiculously boring books by FRENCH sociologists and you enjoy doing head slams for three hours during a night class.

It didnt have a lot to do with middle school though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was the worst.

Required reading for this course had to be bought from one non-DePaul bookstore, which was MAJORLY annoying (and expensive - way not to be capitalistic!) Reading seemed unrelevant to class discussion which seemed unrelevent to course objectives.

As far as many of the comments on this page are concerned I am not surprised. The education students that I have encountered at DePaul are extremely depressing...I hope most of them go into a different field becaus</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was super boring... he made you do these weekly papers and made us read so many pointless books then made individual people present in front of the entire class. His mind also wanders when you discuss in class. Don't take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2005<br>Class Name: SCG411<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class.

People who do not like this class, and this professor, are usually slow and incapable of deep thought or reflection. I learned more in this class than in most of my undergraduate classes combined.

His class IS about teaching middle school.

Class discussion can get pretty abstract and some of the reading was difficult to get through, but he usually provided provocative questions and response.
