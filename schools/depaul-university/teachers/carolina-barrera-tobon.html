She is not easy and really pushes you to succeed, but she is very sweet and quirky. There is lots of group work (which is typical with Spanish classes at DePaul).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: SPN351<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She acts like this is the only class on your workload. She would have at least 3 lengthy assignments due every single class session. For finals, she assigned us a research paper, a 12 minute presentation, and also an in-class exam. Waaaay too much; she overkilled everything. She tried her best to be helpful outside of the classroom, though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2015<br>Class Name: SPN351<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't listen to other reviews, Carolina is a GENIUS. She is the absolute best for linguistics studies and so extremely educated in her field. She is a wonderful professor who cares about her students and is always available to help. She dedicates so much time to making the class work, and naturally expects the same effort. Want to learn? Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2013<br>Class Name: SPA201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: D+</div><div id="right"><div>Hard professor without a doubt. She is smart and knows her stuff but too strict to her bad lesson plan. She makes us read one to two chapters before class and do homework regardless if we understood the material. This professor need to change her lesson plan or quit teaching all together. Just plain HORRIBLE!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She intimidates the heck out of the class. The assignments are unclear and the homework is required to be done before the material is taught in class. Also a really hard grader. No one in the class received an A on the midterm  before the curve and she takes forever to give back assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel like this Professor has too much going on in her life to focus on teaching. Her syllabus is very confusing and she makes us turn in homework before she teaches the lesson. She grades the homework extremely hard and almost everyone does bad on them. Also, sometimes she snaps on us if we don't understand something or are confused</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2013<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is extremely unclear with her assignments and in her syllabus. It is as though she wants you to fail and she expects that we complete assignments before the lessons are even taught. If I was paying money to read a book and complete assignments on my own, then I would be fine with this situation, but that's not the case.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2012<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a lot of work for this class, but she's a great teacher. If you have any questions whatsoever, she's more than happy to answer them. She's definitely a bit intense, but she just really wants you to do well. I'd definitely take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2012<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very enthusiastic about her subject. She teaches the class like a high school class. Students are reprimanded for leaving class, even for a minute. She is unclear about assignment guidelines and she is virtually unapproachable.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
