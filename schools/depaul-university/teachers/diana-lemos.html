Don't recommend her, she makes you do the most & her accent is annoying.  I can't get over how boring the class was & the fact that I paid money for it. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2014<br>Class Name: 231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her as a teacher but did not enjoy community psychology.  It was such a dry subject that it was extremely difficult to study for it. Exams are straightforward and journals make it easy to get a good grade. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: 231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME PROFESSOR! She's super sweet and genuinely wants  her students to pass. Her exams is the material she lectured on using clear and understanding powerpoints so it's super easy to succeed. Always gives assignment extensions! She truly cares about her students and their grade. Take her I promise you will not be disappointed!!!! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2014<br>Class Name: PSYCH231<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Her Community Psychology class at UIC is decent. Gives the same information as the book; reading it is highly recommended! Seems very nice and attentive. Incorporates useful videos, activities, and encourages discussion in class. Otherwise, tests are somewhat easy for the most part. Journals are due every week, but I enjoyed doing them. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2014<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I have ever had! She was unorganized and would never offer any help when asked. How could DePaul let her teach!! My GPA dropped because of her, regret taking this class with her so much!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had an awful experience in this class. I learned nothing, and want my money back. She is extremely unclear and unhelpful. She expected us to know things that she didn't even know herself. Her lectures were excruciatingly boring and the wording was so awkward and unclear. I would not suggest her to anyone... switch out if you have the chance!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She tries, but she fails. She's disorganized, confusing, and unprepared. It would have been much easier and more informative to just read the textbook and not go to class.She often doesn't give enough information about assignments (sometimes doesn't even tell us about assignments until the day they're due). Terrible. Shouldn't be allowed to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2014<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was not good at all. She reads directly off of the powerpoints and offers little to no help at all. Pick another teacher</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
