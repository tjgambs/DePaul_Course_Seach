I have her for an online class, so it may be different in an actual class, but she is very dull and her lectures are read word for word from the book (which I never opened). Helpful professor and easy A, but you will be bored to death. Not professional. Made me want to change my major (I'm a PRAD major). </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Dr. Dillard.  She was very genuine and listened to my concerns. I guess some people can't take her straight forward communication style.  She showed an interest in helping me with my career and wrote a recommendation for me.  I got the internship. I would take her class, just be sure to follow the rules and ask for help when needed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2013<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this over intercession.  Had no issues.  She is smart and the class was fun.  Your mileage may vary if you have her during normal school session.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD335<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very disorganized, unprofessional , and confusing. She did not explain assignments clearly or grade them fairly. Treated us like we were in 4th grade and spoke very condescendingly toward anyone who challenged her. Do not take this class.  You are better off flipping a coin to determine your grade. 3.75 good student and this class was horrible!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD335<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unprofessional.When asked for further clarification on a subject matter,she'd answer "you should already know that" or "I don't know." I'm not spending my time and money to be treated disrespectfully.First professor I've ever had issues with. I'm disappointed in DePaul.She needs to be re-evaluated.In the mean time, future students,avoid taking</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD335<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really unprofessional and unorganized.
