	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

Dreaded taking this class but ended up enjoying it and learning more than ever expected.Can be offensive to some, but don't take him seriously when he refers to you as an alchie the entire quarter...(like he did to one kid in my class).Makes you think about things differently and question your beliefs.Easy grader, take him if u can</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2007<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sorry to learn that he wasn't tenured.

He's amazingly intelligent and he has got to be the funniest professor at DePaul.

I took him once and dont plan to do it again because I care for my GPA and his class is a gamble of that!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2007<br>Class Name: PSC234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very, very intelligent man. He's sort of funny - laughs at his own jokes more than anyone else. Though I learned a lot about Israel and Palestine, I wish the class would have felt a little more unbiased. Finkelstein is a strange strange man and will say things sometimes that just totally surprises you. He's definitely a big fan of himself.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: PSC233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is nothing, and I mean NOTHING better in the world than a sexy, radical Jewish intellectual who knows what he's talking about, hilarious to listen to and with lots of insightful thoughts about the political reality in the world these days.

Most of the negative comments here are posted by people who aren't his students, he actually never lectures about the topics he's known for in class. Instead he's a dedicated instructor who will challenge you to think for yourself and uses the Socratic method of teaching. He's also kinda hot!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2006<br>Class Name: PSC231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DePaul's finest. Finkelstein is an iconoclast. He makes you question everything and forces you to take a stand on issues. He makes class engaging and fun. I have utmost respect and admiration for him. He's a great role model.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2006<br>Class Name: PSC123<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2006<br>Class Name: PSC123<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2006<br>Class Name: PSC000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2006<br>Class Name: PSC231<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Finklestein is the best teacher I've ever had at DePaul. He is one of the FEW Political Science teachers who keeps his ideology out of the classroom and for that I commend him. He is masterful at the way he pushes his students to think and to question political and moral dilemmas and he keeps his opinions well hidden. I sincerely recommend hi</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2006<br>Class Name: PSC999<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>his lectures are very informative. go hear him speak.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/15/2006<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I also agree that there is something about Finkelstine that is kind of atractive/handome. He was one of my favorite professors in DePaul and those who talk bad about him are just haters. Finkelstine is awsome! He is intelligent and makes you enjoy class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2006<br>Class Name: PSC235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't believe that no one here has mentioned how unbelievably HANDSOME Finkelstein is! He is a FANTASTIC professor, completely dedicated to the truth & very engaged with his students. Sure he has his own biases (doen't everyone&#63;) but he is also quite deft in pointing out your own &quot;isms&quot;. Keep an open, nonjudgemental mind & you'll learn lots!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2006<br>Class Name: PSC235<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Finklestein was great! I was kind of worried about taking a class with him because his reputation preceeds him good or bad. I found that all you have to do is relax and dont take things so personal. It was a really good learning experience for me. I got an A!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2006<br>Class Name: PSC324<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yeah, sure he is quite biased.....we all are, though-that's not the issue with the prof.  What he does is make you think in a completely different manner, turning you upside down and inside out.  There's a lot of self-evaluation in this class.  Plus, he's hilarious and classes go by so fast.  Easy A or B</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: PSC233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was afraid to take this prof. at first b/c of some of the comments here, but after this class I don't know why anyone would complain about him. We all have biases! I'll admit you know where he stood on the pol. spctrm. (and I wasn't on that end), but if you want to be challenged to think, take this class. I loved him and I hope you do too! =)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2006<br>Class Name: SEVERAL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2006<br>Class Name: PSC393<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a junior honors seminar on the Middle East conflict.  It was amazing!  It was a lot of reading, but you don't have to do it all to do well in the class.  Just take good notes on his lectures.  He is a great professor-intelligent, very clear, and thought-provoking.  Highly recommended for students who actually want to learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2006<br>Class Name: LOTSOFPSC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've ever had.

I learned so much in his class. He likes to joke around with everyone so don't get offended. He is biased but hides his bias and doesn't mind if you have different views than he does, as long as you have a strong case. He likes participation. Fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: PSC233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Finkelstein is very narrow-minded. He appears to open the dialogue to opposite points of view but, when he disagrees with you, he is prone to subtly reminding you that you, as a student, are subject to his final grade. He also employs erroneous logic to inject his blind bias against Israel without permitting a free rebuttal.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Finkelstein is a great professor. I think he is challenging but fair, he will make you look like a fool in class if you don't know your****.

He actually doesn't even teach what he writes and lectures about so nice try guys. Finkelstein is brilliant and very sweet. You'll learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2006<br>Class Name: PCS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's tough & he'll challenge every one of your premises.I found it invigorating to finally have a prof. who doesn't spout the usual namby-pamby garbage & takes a definitive stance, rightly or wrongly. He doesn't want you to be a drone which is why he'll provoke you, he wants you to be able to think independantly. I certainly learned something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2006<br>Class Name: LOTSOFPSCS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Finkelstein IS a great professor. Some people are just so anal about everything that they cannot handle a different but interesting form of teaching. It is very refreshing to see a professor that is not constricted to just talking about what is socially acceptable. So what if he is biased, everyone is.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2006<br>Class Name: PSC234<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely smart.
