He's a smart guy, a nice guy, but an abysmal teacher! You leave lecture thinking you've got this, then you see his homework, tests, and quizzes and they're not even close to in-class material. Doesn't use the book and he uses his own terminology so there's no way you can verify what he's saying from an outside source.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2015<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>just take him. he talks a little bit fast, goes very fast on lectures but just ask him again, he'll repeat it for you. very intelligent and funny. bio is not easy. its usually not the professor, it's you. you don't only rely on the professor, you gotta keep reading and studying to get an A in this class, I got a B which was okay.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2014<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an alright teacher. Really enjoys and is interested in what he teaches his students. However, he does go through material really fast and it is hard to understand him at times. He also doesn't use lecture slides. He is willing to help his students.
