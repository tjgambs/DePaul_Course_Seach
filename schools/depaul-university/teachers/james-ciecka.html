			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

I took Stats and Calculus in Undergrad and earned A's in each course, far from the case in this class.  In order to succeed you must have a strong math background, visit his office hours frequently and take perfect notes. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2014<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not an easy class but he is by far one of the best professors at DePaul.

Even worse, if you ask a question he makes you feel dumb while he answers it. The only thing that saved my grade was a take home final so I could work on it over 10 hours.

The guy is not helpful and flies over the material. Don't get behind, study hard and work on all home-works. This guy has to be a PhD professor, not MBA's. I hated Calculus and Statistics before, I hate it even more after this class. That alone says enough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: ECON380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away unless you have extensive math and econ background.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have an option-DON'T take this class with him. He is a nice guy, but the worst teacher ever. He is a fair grader, you'd be able to get a good grade, but you'll be doing all the studying on your own- he is no help.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ciecka is a quirky guy. He's so brilliant, but at times, it is hard to understand what he wants you to learn. That, and the subject material (for me) was freakin' hard. My advice is to attend his study sessions and lean on your classmates. It's amazing what clarity you'll get it you put some grit determination into learning the stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2009<br>Class Name: ECON380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>IDK where to start the class is a waste it only dealt with econ theories it wasnt till week 6 a kid asked how does this relate to anything and then he tried to explain..overall the class is just like an advance algebra class so if you wanna take that take him. multi choice tests..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is one of the best! He knows his stuff and can teach it to anyone with an ounce of willingness to work. Too many slackers in DePaul's KMBA program. Those folks will not be the ones to keep their current jobs (if they even have one) during/after this depression. They will be working at Denny's or Wal-Mart probably WITHOUT an MBA. Pathetic!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Agreed with other comments.  Had him in the spring.  Prof. Ciecka belongs in a research institution, not a professional school like KGSB.  Nice man, but not good at teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2008<br>Class Name: GSB240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awful professor.  Very intelligent, but this does not translate into being a good teaching.  Poor communicator.  Talks over your head.  DO NOT TAKE IF YOU WANT TO LEARN!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take someone else.  Professor has a difficult time transferring his knowledge to students.  Teaching approach is to throw the kitchen sink at students.  Overwhelms amount of useless information and covers each concept once at a blazing pace,  Huge test curves accurately represent poor teaching.  Spend your tuition dollars wisely</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor.  Knows content very well and expects you to know it also.

Does not go over exams once they are graded. Test questions are either ridiculously hard or shockingly easy...no in between. Don't recommend. Only students who already know material well seem to do well. Texts will NOT backup what you can't learn form his lectures! Don't take w/another hard class!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof, really passionate about the course. Sometimes he goes little bit out of subject into math history, but this was very interesting for me. Tests are OK, problems are very similar to ones in the homework assignments. Work in groups for take-home final, this will help a lot to get points, because in-class final was on the hard side.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smart guy.  Tough tests.  Make sure you come to class and do the homework.

Spends lots of time explaining development of equations and not enough time explaining real world application or how to use them for hw probs. Work with a group on hw/take-home exam. Tests are not difficult if you study. Prof is VERY willing to help after class/in office. Wipes out entire forests w/all his handouts.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Should have discussed homework in class. Fair grading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Recipe for success in this class.  Do the homework, make a copy of your homework before you go to class.  Hand in your homework.  Then when he goes over the homework, right down the answers he gives you on your homework that you made a copy of. Never miss class.  Take good notes. Can't memorize material, must understand. Grading is fair with curve.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a very effective lecturer.  Would be extremely helpful to get solutions to problems for homework.  Uses about ten different types of notation for each problem so its difficult to figure out what hes asking.  Gives a rediculous (est of 30 hours to complete) take home final plus an in class final and says &quot;oh is 30 hours alot&#63;&quot; Stay Away from him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Ciecka really knows his stuff, but he spent too much time on the mathematical derivation of the formulas, which you really don't need to know. He's extremely helpful if you seek him out. A few of us worked together as a study group and he came to some of our sessions. Do the homework and be prepared for the final: it's extremely theoretical!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an excellent professor who really knows the material. If you have taken any amount of high school or college calculus or stats, the first few lectures go really slow. My classmates who weren't academically prepared seemed really challenged at the pace. Be prepared for exam questions that come out of left field. Important-Do the homework!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ciecka is a good teacher. He gets a bad rep because he moves quickly through his lectures.  There's a lot of material and that needs to be taken into consideration.  I'm not a fan of the class because it's so difficult but Ciecka is fair and an expert in the field.  His curves really make a difference and the exams come directly from notes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ciecka really knows his stuff, but can't really teach it.  If you're polite and ask for help he's more than willing to assist.  The curve in the class is huge, and believe me, you'll need it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2007<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He goes over everything in the book, but when it comes it the exams the way he words it and ask the questions is EXTREMELY confusing. Our class average is a 50% and I believe it isn't the students fault, but also the way a teacher teachs. He also wouldn't reason with us all he said was ask me questions and I'll answer them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ciecka moves fast, if you didn't take Stats/Calc in undergrad, this will be very difficult for you. Working in groups for the HW is key. The class avg was literally 55 on the final. HUGE curve, but so much work for the subject matter! It's hard to make calc fun. Ciecka will help you if you seek it out and go to his office.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a hard class and a majority of the class was lost the whole quarter. The homework is tough but it helps for the take home final which saves your grade in the end. Class averages for exams were 60's without the generous curve he gives.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very smart but doesn't stop to realize that not everyone already knows everything he is teaching. He teaches super fast, he needs to slow down. He grades on a very generous curve which saved me.  The class average for the exams were 60-70's but the take home final is a great grade booster.  You can work in groups for this part of the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly intelligent.  Not the best people skills.  I have no business/calc background and this class kicked my butt left and right.  I would avoid him if possible.  Good thing: I failed every test, but the take home, and received a C.  Show him you're a serious student and he'll be more generous.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: GSB102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The book is easier to understand.

I found that his exams were directly from his class notes and homework. If you want to meet with him, you need to seek him out. You need to go the extra steps to learn the material. It is not all his fault you don’t do well. If you want a challenge take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERy unresponsive to questions.

The tests do not consist of material from the class nor book.  He DOESNT return homework or tests hence you never get answers.
