She is also very nice, helpful, and laid back. I am an HAA major who now loves this subject matter thanks to this class and professor. As long as you go to class and pay attention it's not too hard. She's willing to help you if you need it</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: HAA397<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's really a joy to have Delia as a professor. Her Mexican and Chicano art class is one of the best art history courses I've taken during three years as a major. I highly recommend her to majors especially, though she's also very accommodating to non-majors.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: HAA145<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken an HAA class before and am fully aware that the classes are not easy and require much time however I  know what it takes to get an A in the course. Lots of time and studying. She is absolutely useless as a teacher. Confusing to follow, reads off her ppt. notes and is extremely unhelpful. overally horrific experience and shes rude</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2013<br>Class Name: HAA145<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really interested in the subject matter and makes it fun to learn. I am an Art History major, but didn't know a whole lot about Art of the Americas. She made me really interested and I wanted to know more.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2013<br>Class Name: HAA375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take her class if given the chance! Even if you don't think you like art from the Americas, she'll make you interested. She has so much passion for what she teaches and is very helpful in and out of class if you need it. There was a lot of reading on pdfs but it's worth it. She's great and one of the best in the art history department!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2012<br>Class Name: HAA145<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the lesser evil out of all the 100 level HAA teachers. She's knowledgeable and passionate, but overall a boring class. Memorizing artworks is a given in art history, nonetheless her standards are not on par for this level. She also insists you reference articles in your 10 minute midterm and final exam essays, which is nearly impossible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: HAA145<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class as a way to fulfill A & L req, and I will never take another class in this subject area.The class was extremely boring and sometimes it was hard to follow along or contribute unless you already have some type of art background. The 2 papers are easy, but the midterm and final required a lot of memorization. Wouldn't recommend class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: HAA145<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great teacher! She speaks with such passion about the subject, which makes the lectures a lot easier to get interested in. Try not to skip a class, because she covers a lot! She's also extremely helpful and always available to help you. I had an enjoyable experience in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2010<br>Class Name: HAA247<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this teacher in spring 08/09.  I like the content, but I hate this teacher.  I would not take another class with her even if someone paid me.  She expects you to learn her life long passion in 10 weeks; get real!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: HAA247<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm an art major and I have never gotten lower than an a or b in an art class, but somehow in this class I got a c minus. Her grading is ridiculous. for the final she made us memorize 28 slides and only 6 were on the final. I went to every class. Her expectations are ambitious and unrealistic. She is also extremely boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2010<br>Class Name: HAA247<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are interested in art form, content, etc then take the class otherwise don't even bother. Personally it's boring but she tries to make it interesting. You must bring in the readings she assigns on blackboard. If your absent don't even bother emailing her even though in the beginning of the quarter she says you can, email a classmate.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2010<br>Class Name: HAA375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved her. Even if your not interested in the topic, she makes it interesting! Readings are not necessary to do good in the class but attendance is grades are based on one paper and midterm and final which she gives you study guides for.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2010<br>Class Name: HAA375<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class I took, Mexico City, was at times extremely boring and the readings were long and often uninteresting.  Professor Cosentino, however, is very nice and passionate about her subject.  I would recommend this class only if you are extremely interested in the subject matter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2009<br>Class Name: HAA397<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely.

Professor Cosentino is a good teacher but a bit boring. The class is not very intersting but easy enough to complete as long as you go to class and do the readings.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2008<br>Class Name: LATINART<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good teach. took her for latin american art.. didnt read any of the text and got an A. midterm and final are all from her lectures so take notes.. easy material.. easy class.. easy professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2006<br>Class Name: ART338<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Delia is a wonderful teacher. She is really passionate about her topic of study (Latin American Art History). Yet, the class was a complete bore. If your not into art history, and deep analysis of Mexico City (in ART 338), don't take this course. If you require this course or any other with Delia as a teacher, take it. She is a good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: ART243<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>never read the e-reserves & barely touched the texts.  all u need to do is pay attention in class & jot notes (it all comes from the slides!) that said, she expects precision on her midterm & final.  she is very articulate with her lectures & passionate about the topic so it rarely got boring & actually kept me interested.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: ART243<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class--really cool art from Latin America.

If you disagree with her or correct her, prepare for her to give all of your papers B's. The only reason I got an A- was because of my tests & my art lab prof.
