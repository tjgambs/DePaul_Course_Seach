You get full credit just for completing assignments and he lets you choose when you want to give your presentation. Participation and attendance are kind of important. I definitely recommend taking him. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: Rather not say</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Denton is really knowledgeable and well organized about his subject. He uses d2l effectively and you can also read class notes from this website. There are one midterm and final which include optional questions and required questions. If you take his class, you will not be regretted. If you keep up with class, you will get a good grade for sure</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Denton is an amazing teacher. As an adult student, he is very humorous and really loves his subject. Also he keeps you engaged and his assignments are easy. One of the best teachers I've had at Depaul (not many coming from a transfer student). Take his class if you love history and foreign policy! He needs a pay raise cause he's that good!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2015<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers here. He's lays out everything in the syllabus and really cares about teaching, provides accurate study guides for midterm and final! (and brings treats for the class for both) </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2014<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: P</div><div id="right"><div>Overall a good intro course. Attendance is required (no excused absences). If you come to class and take notes and do the study guides, the midterm/final will be a breeze. Denton is really sweet and smart guy. Easy to follow lectures. 7 opinion essays that are one page but they are fun to write and easy. Great course and professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2014<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Denton is wonderful! He is knowledgeable and makes the content relatable and easy to learn for students. Definitely recommend taking a class with him. There's plenty of work that will keep you busy but it is all relatively easy to do if you keep up with the class readings/</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2014<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LEGEND! Reminds me of some dude that would be in the jungle handling snakes & stuff. Really knowledgeable, easy going and easy tests. Just know the book inside and out. Easy interestingtopics</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2014<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Denton is a riot. His lectures are entertaining and thought-provoking. His midterm was really difficult, you need to study a lot to do well. He is more than willing to help you and gives point back opportunities to those he thinks need them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2014<br>Class Name: 242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Denton is a great teacher who really cares about everyone.  The class isnt so hard as long as you do all the reading which isnt really talked about in class but it will be on your midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2013<br>Class Name: PSC342<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic professor.  Structures his classes to include both lectures and class discussions - really encourages students to debate different topics and explore the implications of the material.  If you have any interest in international affairs and global security politics, this is a great course that covers a lot of the major topics.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2013<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy.  Makes material interesting.   He covers a lot of material but makes it very manageable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, a good introductory level course. Professor cares about you learning and is pretty accommodating. Textbook is a must read and is not always discussed in class. Highly recommended professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2013<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Denton is hilarious. He is so down-to-earth and understanding. Read the textbook - as much as it isn't discussed in class, it will be on the exam. Turn in homework on time and pay attention. Attendance is optional, but you get extra points for being there so you might as well go. Overall, very interesting class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2012<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Prof. Denton! He's such a nice guy. He also is incredibly reasonable as a teacher. If you are at all interested in Foreign Policy, this class is really eye opening and Denton is the man to teach it. Do the readings, there are only a couple a week, very manageable.  He's my fav!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this class. It was interesting and Denton really makes it worthwhile. I admit that the class is hard for some if you don't know hot to properly write a paper but otherwise he's a pretty easy grader. Denton enjoys discussion and is clear and concise toward his students. Midterm/Final were harder but he gives you the majority of questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2012<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy. His speaks quickly, and his lectures can be unclear. Keep up on the reading and his exams are easy. He gives you various ways to get good grades, and he is more than willing to help if you ask. He's kind of funny too. Attendance required and he grades on participation. Going to take him again this quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2011<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought this would be an easy class. but its very difficult. the average on the midterm was a D. he's a nice guy but this is NOT an easy A! Not a blow off class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Uses a variety of different teaching tools.  Interesting material and videos and the books were easy and fun to read.  Moderate grader, but if you pay attention and do the readings tests are a breeze.  There were 2 tests, 1 paragraph journal entries each week and a handful of other small papers.  Easy teacher and good class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice and funny, but very unfair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2011<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To be honest, I find his lectures very annoying.  He states the same thing over and over and makes lame jokes that just wastes time.  However, I would recommend him as a teacher because the syllabus is fairly easy and he seems to be a pretty fair grader. Do not expect to get out early in his night classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2009<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He treats his students as adults and peers - and always with respect.  He encourages discussion. If you want a stadium lecture, this isn't the class for you. If you're a student of Pol Sci, I can't recommend enough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2008<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Night class was entertaining for 2-3 the hours and the films were good.  He had a nice sarcastic sense of humor and was fair to all viewpoints.  His lectures were rather dry, but he complemented them nicely with film and music.  He was also very easy, 2 tests, no papers, attendance was not mandatory.  He basically spelled out all the material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2008<br>Class Name: PCS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher. I took a night class, so 3 hours... But he made it go by fairly quick with many different teaching methods (lecture, discussion, movies, music, etc.). AND attendance not mandatory</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Denton's class was by far the most interesting class I've taken so far. He is very helpful and funny, & isn't strict at all. Just go to the class, read the material, & take notes and you're good to go. If considering this class, I definitely urge you to take it. I know you'll love it. My class met one day a week for 3.5 hrs & I still loved it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2004<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice enough, but not the most focused person, let one student go on and on w/idiotic comments EVERY CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2003<br>Class Name: PSY140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
