His ability to lecture at length and in lucid detail for the entirety of 1.5 hours is as astounding as his ability to keep my attention. At DePaul there have only been 2 or 3 professors who have motivated me to pay attention for the duration of every class; Herrera is one of them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2012<br>Class Name: PYSCH105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very descriptive and a wonderful lecturer</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2012<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really smart.

I looked forward to going to his class everyday. Tests and quizzes can be difficult if you don't do the reading. I recommend reading ahead because it can get pretty overwhelming if you put it off until the last minute. He's a bit egocentric, but if you're like me, it'll just come off as him being attractive.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2012<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talks too fast!

Online quiz each week but you have to read! He's really hot and makes class interesting three take home test which are essays and are really straight forward and easy.  I recommend him.

There is a weekly online quiz every week but you can take it as many times as you want. Classes use a lot of youtube clips, pictures, ect which make his lectures very interesting.  One test that asks fair questions.

He is a book teacher, which means you will have to learn EVERYTHING on your own. He lectures, but it gets off topic really quick. Whenever I email him, he gives me replies back which make me feel dumb for asking. His class makes me question my major every time I attend it.

He is very energetic and likes students to participate and ask questions. He makes classes very interesting, brings in a lot of outside examples and video clips to re-enforce the material.

His lectures are SOO interesting. The tests are hard but there are 2 take homes that can give you a good grade. He really is interested in psych and it really shows. Plus he's sooooo hot. I have honestly had 2 dreams where he makes an appearance :-/</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2009<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved him and the class! He's very entertaining and interesting. Midterm & final aren't bad if you study your notes and read the chapters (or just the summary/&#63;s at the end of each!) Take home tests are easy grade boosters. Would definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2009<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE HIM! its not a mandatory class, yet i went everyday cuz i loved it. he is very energetic and funny. two take home tests, a midterm, and a final. if you are like me and cant remember what you read in a big book, id recommend getting the study guide. helped me out a lot for inclass tests. TAKE HIM! GREAT TEACHER. YOU WONT REGRET IT.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Passionate and energetic, likes to learn, likes to teach. Herrera is always on full throttle, and expects the same of his students. A bit more challenging than your average professor, but there's never a dull moment in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2009<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The teacher is ok. Course is 1 research paper, 1 midterm, and 1 final. The midterm was pretty easy and never got the other stuff back. His only problem is that he talks to fast, however, his in class discussions are quite introspective. He seems like he has a superiority complex, but just likes good conversation. Got an A...but worked hard</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2009<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Herrera's class. He makes everything really interesting and is extremely knowledgeable on the subject.  Even though attendance is not mandatory, it was my only class that I actually looked forward to going to, so I try not to miss it. The class isn't too tough either, but not too easy. I'd recommend it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2009<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Herrera is awesome! The entire course is building up to writing an extremely long research paper on a study that the class conducts! Must read from the book and try to apply during class. He is willing to help you if your struggling...even though it is almost impossible to struggle. Recommend! Recommend! Great Teacher! He does talk a little too fas</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2008<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy easy easy class. You don't even have to show up all quarter except for the tests. 2 in class exams (easy short answer) and 2 take home exams (even easier). final is questions STRAIGHT from the review questions in the book. just 3 short answers. He is a pretty funny professor, but could be mean and unsympathetic at times. Definitely recommend!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hot</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a pretty good professor. 2 in class tests 2 take home tests. the in class tests are mostly on what he talks about in class. for the final STUDY FROM THE BOOK. do it for the in class texts too, just read the reviews at the end of the chapters</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class consists of 2 in class tests 40% (two short answer questions) 2 take home tests 30% (1 short answer questions) and a final 30% (3 short answer questions) Read the chapters, take notes, and listen to the lectures and you'll get an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very enthusiastic but unsympathetic, don't have anyone in your family die, he doesn't care. He will meet after class but he talks so fast, you can barely get what he's saying. I would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: PSYCH106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is adorable!  I love this man to death.  If you have to take any psych class, take him!!!  And he is really hot.  It was hard to pay attention sometimes in class, and he is really helpful too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2008<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Herrera's so smart and hot!  His class is challenging, but I enjoy it because he's passionate and funny.  It's cute when he gets really excited about what he's saying.  He knows so much about psychology.  He seems intimidating, but he's really very friendly and helpful.  I wish he taught more classes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2008<br>Class Name: PSY701<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is interesting and he makes pretty funny jokes. Overall I find the class to be enjoyable. He's not bad looking either</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2008<br>Class Name: PSY401<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is extremely energetic.  Read the book and take notes, because he doesn't go over every point in the book. It is hard to tell what will be on the tests, he reccommends knowing everything in the book. Don't focus on the specifics. He is willing to answer all questions even if you stay behind after class. Overall I enjoy his class.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
