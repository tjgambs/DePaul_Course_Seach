Prof is Dean of Math @ Chicago City Colleges, is moonlighting @ DePaul to keep his teaching certs up. Not terribly invested in students. If you're in MAT130, it's because you need it. Shame he doesn't realize it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice, clearly states what is on exams, hard if you don't study but if you do the work it is fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's good for 8:30 classes, he keeps you awake. but on tests he only collects the scantron; no partial credit! if you study your notes enough, you'll do good on the tests.  overall, recommended b/c he's extremely clear in explaining his stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2004<br>Class Name: MATH<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a funny man who likes keeping students alert in class, but he is a tough teacher since on tests it is either right or wrong, no partial credit whatsoever.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2004<br>Class Name: MAT141<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty funny guy, class is interesting but tests are hard and your grade is only based on 3 tests. Wouldn't recommend taking him if you're worried about your GPA, really hard to get an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2003<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun teacher for an 8:30 AM class.  I do agree with the previous person that I wish he would do homework checks because with only two tests worth 30% and then the final, it really sucks.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2003<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty good teacher for an 8:30 am class. Only problem...only two tests...both worth 30% each...and than a final worth 40%...but doesnt do homework checks...and all tests are scantron..depends on your learning style, but a nice and funny teacher to have.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
