	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

You will earn an A if you show evidence of learning the materials; otherwise your grade will suffer.  That is FAIR and anyone who thinks Rodkin is a pushover is in for a rude awakening!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2006<br>Class Name: MKT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You'll get an A, but that's actually the only thing that you will get from this class.Since practically everyone gets an A, it's unfair to people who show more effort.  So if you bust your a** off in the New Shoes while your team-mates are scratching their behinds, be prepared that they will get the same grade as you will (you guessed it-an A).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seems like a heavily succesful man. However, the class was nothing more than an easy grade. I didn't walk away knowing more. If effort was put into it, you would learn, however your learning wasn't enforced with work. Marketing to Hank is common sense, not cumbersome words that try to make more of the easy subject. Class as a whole was a breeze.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy and his class is easy, but I too feel that I should be getting more for my buck. 2 papers at the beginning, a midterm, and a final (which is basically one big joke- you get one powerpoint question).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2006<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A.  He has a lot of experience in the field and a lot of good stories, but I sometimes felt that I should be getting more out of a grad. level class, esp. since I'm paying for it myself.  The longest class was 2 out of 3 hours.  Grade based on mid-term, computer simulation game, and showing up for the final.  Very little reading, no homework.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers at Depaul.

Night class never went more than an hour and a half, I never read a word in the book because the midterm was open-note and the final was &quot;Who wants to be a millionaire&quot;-style.

Easiest grade ever.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2006<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely love him!

I think he sucks as a professor. I tried really hard to like him. Just reads the slides realy fast. For some reason with me, I would try to do well with papers and he would take away as many points that was worth. Very unclear with me. Disagree with his grading system. Didn't teach the class anything</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2005<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class was pretty easy, no exams just the game and grade based on it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2005<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rodkins the man, he's so down to earth and relaxed. He doesn't make the lectures hard or the readings. It's all totally managable. It's an easy A and the marketing game you play is easy and fun. Totally reccommended for the summer, trust me you NEVER stay the full class time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy &quot;A&quot;.
