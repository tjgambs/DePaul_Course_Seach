Many alumni who studied under her have told me how instrumental the research methods she teaches us are for higher education and personal study, & those claims could not have been more true.She has high expectations,but is someone you can turn to for help.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2014<br>Class Name: INT204INT206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nast is unbelievably brilliant and moved me to an existential crises during every single one of the classes I have had with her. She makes you THINK, and think HARD about the world that we live in. The course she designed was remarkable and it changed my life.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2014<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nast expects much from her students, but she offers a lot of support and helps them to fulfill her expectations and grow academically and intellectually.  She is very passionate about her classes and students.  It is very clear that making her students stronger academics and better prepared is one of her top priorities.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nast is extremely interested in helping her students succeed academically, professionally, and personally. She challenges you to think critically and question what you've been programmed to think. She's always willing to make time for students and rewards effort. There are only 2 assignments and the rest is reading and class discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is a misnomer.  It had nothing to with borders or identities, and she as someone else mentioned has an ego problem.  She acts like students' lives revolve around her.  She assigns a work load that is out of line with the rest of the university, and she gives females preferential treatment</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2012<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Heidi is hands down one of the most brilliant professors I've had a DePaul. 204 completely revolutionized the way I view history and helped connect the dots of the interrelatedness of politics, economy, class, and identity. I cannot recommend taking a class with Professor Nast enough. Read, think critically, and engage in class, and you'll have fun</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2012<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't have a great impression of her at first. She seemed quite unorganized and the class begun to bore me, but she really is a great person. So sweet and relatable and helpful. Will go to great lengths to help her students. Still didn't like the class by the end of it, but liked her and will consider taking her again for something else.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2011<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nast is one of the most brilliant and  dedicated professors at DePaul. Her class readings are hard, but she wants you to succeed and will go to great lengths to make sure that you understand the material. (As long as you do the work for her class!) This class is demanding, but more than doable with the help of her  insights and course material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a sweetheart! I had her for discover pets and business and she explained everything very clearly. She's also very relatable and intelligent, and she bought us pizza on the last day. Seriously take her shes so nice</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2011<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is by far the best teacher I've had at DePaul. She's inspiring and always takes time out of her schedule for her students. Extremely knowledgeable about the world we live in and why it is this way. We don't have to research the pet industry anymore, but it makes so much sense in relation to the class that I wish did. Take her! And do the work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2010<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Nast is an amazing teacher.  Although her teaching style is a bit different, if you keep your mind open you can learn a lot from her.  She is very caring about her students and is very knowledgeable in her field of study.  She is always willing to help out if you have questions and gives you a lot of guidance, you just have to ask for it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2009<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nast is very intelligent and wonderful. If you pay attention and attend class, everything pulls itself together and makes sense. She isn't trying to EXPLOIT her students by making them do her research dummies. It's just all part of her research, that whatever students' topics might be regarding pets, there's always certain patterns in them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2009<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's wonderful.

Shes a great teacher that really cares about making your brain twitch and work. I LOVE her class. Sure shes a bit scatter brained, but that makes the class interesting. I also do NOT get the ego thing. As long as you open your mouth in class, you'll get on her good side.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2009<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>attending class isn't mandatory, but professor nast will notice if you're gone.. BEWARE. your grade heavily depends on 2 things: the midterm and final paper. for INT'ers required to take 204 or 206, try your hardest to get the other professor, I was unlucky to have her as the only option. the review below mine sums her up nicely.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Heidi's ego seriously impedes the learning process. She humiliates students in front of the class if they say something she doesn't agree with. She forced us to do all of her research for her. We all spent 25+ hours researching her area of study. I felt used, exploited, and I am resentful of the time that this class wasted. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's an intelligent professor but understanding exactly what she expected from students took some time to figure out- be persistent with asking her what you're unsure about. grading scheme was a bit confusing, I was very nervous to get my grade at the end of the quarter</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: INTER206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nast is dedicated to her teaching and her students.

You do learn a lot, she deconstructs your thinking and that can be challenging but it also opens up different perspectives. Its not easy, but if you wanna learn to think outside the box, do it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2008<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She showed up 15 minutes late everyday, hardly prepared for class. This course had no structure whatsoever and we got the syllabus waaay too late. She only read 1/4 of my midterm before giving me a grade. Our final grades were supposed to be posted a week ago, and they're still not up. She is completely crazy and inaccessible.

It was supposed to help us get acquainted with DePaul and Chicago, but I ended up getting aqcauinted with the pet markets around the world. I don't know why she thinks it is helpfull to know this stuff. DO NOT TAKE!! She designed to be the level of a graduate course. I don't know why.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2006<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she has got to be one of the worst teachers in my life. she makes us do work that has nothing to do with the class. basically to sum her up she is the nicest **** you will ever meet. If you like asking her questions and then being completely ignored then she is the teacher for you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2006<br>Class Name: INT203<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was interested in this class even though it was required, but she made me want to change majors. She is definitely the worst prof. I have ever had. She is smart, but is intolerable! She doesn't count any opinions except her own and she doesn't explain her assignments. She tried to turn everything I said around to try and make me look ****!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2006<br>Class Name: INT203<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Before she was ok.  This quarter she seems distracted and all over the place.  If you take her class, remember &quot;subject, verb, direct object&quot; when writing papers.  You can thank me later.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her for my focal point requirement... I was excited for the class, but as it progressed, I quickly realized that she really was not that great of a professor. She believes everyone cannot write grammatically correct essays, so watch out</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nast is brilliant and very open minded.  She is one of the best professors that I have ever had at DePaul.  I highly recommend her because you will learn a lot.  I try to take her every opportunity that I get.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: INT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>yeah, she is a little out there, but that is part of what makes her cool.  i liked the class, and she was interesting and passionate about her work.  She spent a lot of time in Africa, and she is really smart.  Take her, but expect to be challenged a little.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nast is irritating beyond belief. She is condescending, judgmental, and just plain crazy. I could not stand listening to her for 90 minutes. Plus, she is very unclear about what she expects from you as a student, yet she marks you off for not adhering to her standards. I would not reccommend her to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2005<br>Class Name: HON204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yeah, I'll agree that this woman is nuts, but I still love her.  She is a great prof..  She is smart, and classes are interesting.  She is also easy to talk to if you have problems with the material.  Very insightful.  Changed the way I think about the world.  But I will repeat it again, she's wildly eccentric . . . and easy, too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: CHICAGO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my absolute favorite professors.

She does not explain the curriculum and future assignments well and lets you know maybe two or so days before they are due. She is kind but her class structure is very iritating because she does not explain what she wants from the class and from the students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2005<br>Class Name: HONISP<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Let's put it this way, I got an A and I still hate her and hate her teaching style.

Hypocritical, confrontational, and argumentative for no reason (and not just argumentative for the sake of class discussion). She acts black and like she lives in the ghetto, but she lives in a nice apartment on the lakefront! I had a 89.5 and she couldn't give me the A. Definitly has favorites. Avoid at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2005<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazinf professor.  She let's you know exactly what she is looking for in order to get a good grade.  At first she comes off as scary, but she is always willing to help and she is an amazing, intelligent woman.  Take her!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2005<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Watch out for her.  True she is strong and intelligent, but I havent met many people who are such bad individuals.  Take the class, learn what you can, but dont talk to her.  BE CAREFUL.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nast is an interesting professor. She instigates innovative and challenging discussions that really surpass most of the discussions i've had at DePaul.  Although, she tends to be a harsh personality, and is not very clear on assignments.  I recommend utilizing her office hours when confused.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2005<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most remarkable women ever.  People should be lining up at the door to take advantage of the great privilege it is to have her at DePaul. Don't forget how ignorant people are and when you're as experienced and open-minded as her you'd probably get frustrated with the stupid comments I hea</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class, was terrible, act like she knew so much about Black people, but really didn't.

Inefficiently uses class time (ie spending 45 min going over the grammar of one question).  However in the end, if you do the work, come to class, and read everything you will not only do well but your writing will become more clear.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She scares many suburban white kids by being straight forward about racism. She doesnt let it go ignored. She can come off rude but she is very helpful if you meet her outside of class. Dont let her scare you. She really wants her students to learn and make a difference.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2004<br>Class Name: INT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an easy professor, but her personality and &quot;teaching&quot; style make ANY of her classes not worth taking. She is the personification of the ignorant American political correctness gone astray. She is also very offensive if you are white. DO NOT TAKE HER!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2004<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most incredible teachers that has ever touched my life.  Be careful not to take her personality the wrong way, she comes across strong (because she is).  One of the most influential women of the decade.
