Problems are easier than other professors but she is not good at teaching. I got a high majority of answers correct on all exams but she took off many points for not showing every step of my work.

She is not encouraging at all. Half the class dropped because most would not pass. Her teaching does not make sense and she is just obnoxious.

You will be teaching yourself the material. Not an easy class but if you do the self tests you'll be good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i don't even know how to begin with her horrible teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135404<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a sweet older lady who can barely walk and goes through lectures very slowly. She is kind of awkward and makes little comments that she thinks are funny but aren't. We ONLY use the book. We didn't have a good relationship but I learned what I needed to learn to get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/16/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible teacher. I have never had to retake a class, nor have I have received less than an A- until I took her class. Unclear, mean, and no sympathy.

I failed this class the previous quarter and took her because she gives homework from the book, not MathLab.  Very hard class for me, I passed this time but it was my own effort, not her teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY! Anything I learned in this class I learned on my own. She doesn't explain things well and if you have a question she tells you to go to her office hours. She is also extremely rude commenting anytime someone is even a little late (get over it!)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rochelle is a great calculus professor! I've had her for the last two quarters, and I'm very pleased with her teaching style and her exams.  There is nothing on the exam that she does not go over in class. Don't miss class and you won't end up like the these unfortunate comments. PS I hate math and I pulled an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It didn't help that I got mono and had to miss a couple classes, but the final consisted of "business" situations that she only went over once in class. The first exam was very simple and the material is straightforward. Very awkward mannerisms, but her lessons are nice to follow.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very difficult.  Picky on grading.  Didn't enter a single grade until long after I took the FINAL.  Prepare to learn from the book.  Lots of homework & attendance is mandatory.  Never recieved a grade lower than an A until her. DO NOT TAKE.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Got a good grade but the class was boring. She was a bit crazy and is far too old to be teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was an interesting person. She makes the weirdest jokes and giggles at her own words ALL THE TIME. It's crucial to attend her class or you'll fall behind. Her policy with collecting homework at the midterm is nice. She's easy to get along with. And as long as you do your homework and keep up in class. it'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Before coming to this class I was terrified because I hadn't really studied calculus but this class was not hard at all. She assigns an extreme amount of homework but she gives you plenty of time to get it done. Her explanation of the material was very clear. I would recommend taking her class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In the beginning of the quarter I thought exactly what everyone said about her: really hard and a horrible teacher. She does give ALOT of hw but she gives the answers to everything and homework is optional. If you do all the work you get extra points toward your final grade. She only gives a final and two tests, but takes the better of the two.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never had such a horrible math teacher I am excellent at math and she made me hate math all together she basically tells you that if you have a job you cannot be in her class because her class is the most important thing in the world and you will basically fail if you don't devote the entire quarter to just her.. she is pathetic don't take h</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wish I would have taken PLAGER first!!! I failed my first quarter of MAT 135 with another professor. Plager helped me actually understand the material. If you are terrible with math, she is the professor to take. I personally didn't take her because of the RMP rating but I wish I would have. She will give you the solutions along with ALL of your </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TERRIBLE!!! She must be tenured. there us no other way she would still be teaching here. I cant believe i spent thousands to listen to her talk about nothing and miss class consistently but expect us to take her tests on time. Karma totally got her though....Fall on your face again..please!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is not as bad as what people say.  She gives a lot of homework but gives you all the answers, therefore the work is optional and you can get credit for copying her answers.  As long as you know the basic concepts the tests are easy, and you take two and she picks the better of the two.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The WORST teacher in the world. NEVER TAKE THIS CLASS. Assigns way too much homework and makes your life completely miserable. She's the reason i have ever received my first F in my life and now have to retake this course and spend more money. University needs to take care of this teacher.....get rid of her tenure and fire her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly recommend to do whatever you can to make sure you do whatever it takes to take her never.

She is an evil lady. She was just so mean. She was really condescending when you would ask her a question. She offers little to no help..but she is a great teacher.

Just ignore her god awful clothes and she will make business calc 1 easy as pi (yeah yeah i know). I suck at math (d's in high school) but I got an A in her class, so that should say something.

She gives the answers to all the homework so as long as you can copy numbers you will succeed.  Not always clear in her lectures, but makes up for it by giving step by step instructiongs for each problem on the homework.  Test content is very predictable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was ridiculous! I did not like her at all.  She did give all the answers to homework, but she also assigned a ridiculous amount.  She always made students feel stupid and wasn't very helpful at all.

She gives you the answers and as long as you do the work (It's a lot of work), you're golden.

Her hand writing is pretty sloppy but after about a week I got used to it. She does laugh at her own jokes which aren't too funny but I got used to it.

It's no wonder that shes the only one laughing at her own jokes. I always got the feeling that she was yelling the material at us.

She does give alot of homework but if you do it, there's no way you get lower than a B on her final which counts for 60% of your grade.

She gives a TON of homework like you don't have a life outside of math. 60% of your grade is the final and 30% is on the midterm. She's not very supportive to students and think that if you work more than 20 hours a week then you'll absolutely fail, which i worked 25 hrs and still passed!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i would recommend taking another BMS class if u have her. Her final is 60% of your grade. i was getting a B throughout the quarter and i got a D on the final and wound up getting a D in the class.

I highly recommend her if you struggle in math.  I struggled, but she teaches it to make it easy.
