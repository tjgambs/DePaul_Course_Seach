The class itself is very interesting and he takes what could be boring material and brings it to life.  With that said, the course consists of lectures, a mid-term, and a final.  No review before exams, no study guides, very vague direction.  You'll work really hard to get an A or B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2006<br>Class Name: BLW200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this class!!!  Platek is AMAZING, he really makes you think. The course requires a good amount of reading but its a Law class so it should be expected. One of the best classes I have ever taken. Even if you do poorly on the exams you can make up for it with the case briefs. I got C's on the exams but he gave me a B+ cause I did most of the case briefs.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2006<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You have to work for the grade you want.

Makes class extremely funny and interesting. This guy is hilarious, but you can also learn a lot from him. Great class, great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: BLW<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Crazy Teacher... Agreed! Different teaching style, and one of the only classes I look foreward too! Lectures relate to real life issues, and you leave the class feeling like you learned something you may use everyday! One of the best teachers at DePaul for sure! Take him! You will not regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2005<br>Class Name: ETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very different teaching style. Class lectures did not have any direction and very little to do with the book, mostly current events and weird things about moo-cows. Take the class and you'll understand.  Tests were True/False.  Very difficult for a 'grey area' like law and ethics.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2005<br>Class Name: BLW<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Agree with the previous comment. Pretty crazy guy, but definitely the right guy for the job. Cuts very well through all of the pc bullcrap, although might scare some of the weaker types off with the first lecture. Definitely take him if you want something more than just the book read to you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2005<br>Class Name: BUSINESSLAW<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The bomb digity.  By far the craziest teacher depaul has to offer.  If your interested in three hours of complete insanity you need to take this guy.  First thing he says to class &quot;i dont care what your name is or who you are&quot;</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
