We had great conversations. She's a professor who cares about her students and their grades. She lets you revise your papers and if you ask, she will give you a rubric of what she expects.

Would recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really great professor! Class time is more discussion regarding the subjects of our writing. You can revise all essays! She's a very charming professor.

I took wrd103  to get credit, but the difficulty level outweighed the expectations. I never once believed I could get less than an A in an English class, but now I got a B.
