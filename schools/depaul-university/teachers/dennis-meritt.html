The class requires two presentations (midterm and final), a midterm exam, a midterm paper, and a final paper. Sounds like a lot but it's very easy. He is a great professor, tells awesome stories. Overall, he is great. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>he is amazing! he knows so much about endangered species and biology, and what he is unfamiliar with, he is more than excited to learn. this class is all about participation and writing papers. however, thats what all lsp 112 classes are supposed to be about. shared stories, brought frogs! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best Professors I've had at DePaul. Easy class but also very very interesting. You learn a lot and this definitely was my favorite class this quarter. You have homework almost every class, but its simply to answer 10-15 questions. The questions are directly answered in the readings. No final! One quiz and it wasn't for credit. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2015<br>Class Name: 350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>This class was great! he Had a lot of interesting stories about the animals he has encountered through his career. He is very to the point and his tests are easy if you take notes. Easy grader, only a 2-3 page paper due a week ranging in different animal adaptions. His classes are great and no textbook needed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was one of my favorite professors by far. He is so dedicated to his work and has so much knowledge that class is so interesting. I took this LSP class randomly to fill my schedule it was my favorite class. You do have hw every night but it is on of the lighter focal point classes. He is so interesting and is just a great professor. TAKE HIM.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome. And he's friends with Jane Goodall, so there's that. I hate science, and the book he gave us to read actually made the subject of diseases really interesting to me. You read a chapter a week and answered some questions. Two presentations, one for midterms and one for the final, each on a specific disease. Very fun and easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Meritt is extremely dedicated to the subjects he teaches, and he passes that interest onto his students. It is easy to get an A in this class. Just show up to every class, and do the hw assignments. They seem like a lot of work at first, but if you just do what he asks, you will get full credit. He made the final optional. Highly recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. He is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about subject. Its a writing intensive course but he is a super easy grader and would rather accept a late paper than no paper at all. Super easy and interesting class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>there is homework for almost each class, a midterm & a final, a final paper, a presentation, and possibly a quiz or two (he did not grade them though). So, it is a lot of work BUT he is the best & sweetest professor you could have for a seminar course. I'm going to miss his interesting stories. absolutely take if you can do the work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher ever.

If you do your homework, and attend classes and listen you will be sure to receive an A. A lot of busy work, but the readings were usually interesting.

He's VERY knowledgeable on the material covered in class (for me, it was disease in humans & wildlife.) There are reading assignments every class and a supplementary packet of questions from the assigned chapter; however, these are questions taken directly out of the text. Class was pretty easy and he takes late work if you're absent.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took his endangered species focal point. It was a very interesting class but you need to pay attention in order to get everything. Just make sure you take a lot of notes to study for the midterm and it will be easy.
