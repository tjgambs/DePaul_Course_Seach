Tests were kinda tough, but not too bad given the amount of work done. She is super understanding and really cares about her students!! Super available and only wants to help. Super passionate and loves what she's teaching though she is incredibly disorganized and goes on tangents</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Dr. Hansman. As an adult student, I love how deep her lectures are. A lot of kids don't appreciate it her intellectual and deep lectures.  She barely gives out any work and her classes are all lecture. She is very nice and outspoken. If you want to learn, take her. Her work is also easy. I feel bad for her cause she's so passionate too</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2014<br>Class Name: HAA220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely love art and Buddhism and I thought she was a very sweet lady. HOWEVER, she constantly jumps back and forth between slides,  making it extremely hard to take notes. This makes studying for exams the WORST. It's funny that she is a professor of Buddhist art yet she is very eccentric and emotional. Would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: HAA220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>The most unorganized professor ever. The powerpoints are all over the place and she doesn't define specific pieces to know for the exam. Slow at posting slides, and it rooms hours to get her notes under control enough to study. Nice lady, but boring and confusing class. Would not recommend</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very easy prof. requires like 3 books but very rarely were they used. take if interested in art/art history. incredibly easy. the complainers are the people who dont rly appreciate art. be sure to participate in discussions! that is a guaranteed A if u contribute intellectually. she's funny too, not a boring class at all. there is groupwrk</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2013<br>Class Name: HAA220401<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the cutest and sweetest lady ever which makes me feel bad saying that she should not be a teacher. She clearly loves and knows what she is talking about but is the most unclear and confusing teacher I have ever had. She does not know how to teach to students who do not possess prior knowledge of the subject matter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2013<br>Class Name: HAA115<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's scatterbrained and all over the place. But the woman is adorable. If you get past the ridiculous amount of times she says "um" in a given class, she's pretty great. She's pretty crazy, but a pretty good professor. She knows her stuff and gets really passionate about it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>take a class with this professor if you want to be miserable. she is constantly trying to prove that she is the smartest person in the room. she takes everything very personal and will personally attack students. im sure she means well, but has a slight paranoia and anger problem</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2013<br>Class Name: HAA220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's sooo sweet.

She just simply doesn't know how to teach and she seems to grade in a completely subjective way. If you get stuck taking a class with her I have one piece of advice, drop out of school and cut your losses.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2012<br>Class Name: HAA397<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super unorganized. Basically she stops mid sentance and says something else. Powerpoints are all over the place. She's a really nice lady but a horrible professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2011<br>Class Name: HAA115<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i cant believe people are so negative about her! shes an absolute sweetie. Cutest little lady I ever met. She brought us candy the other day because she missed a class. HAA 115 VERY INTERESTING. especially if you love art i strongly recommend this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>After taking her class and getting an A- I still have no idea what it was about.  She is unorganized and impossible to follow.  Do not take her if you can avoid it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2010<br>Class Name: HAA115<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I cannot stand this website and think it is for students who are looking for an easy A/Should return back to high school. That being said, this professor inspired me to get on here to tell you DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. IT IS USELESS AND SHE has NO IDEA what she's talking about. KILL ME. If you want to waste your money learning nothing, take her class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really can't believe the poor reviews here. Professor Hansman is sweet as pie, passionate about the subject, and would offer ANY additional help you needed if you only ask. She encourages participation and students ideas. She grades fairly. I want to put her in my pocket. She's the best. I only regret I've maxed the classes I can take with her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you value sanity, do not take HER. If you value an easy A, go ahead. Her lectures are unorganized, dull, and have nothing to do with the subject. No midterm, no final, just 2 projects a 6th grader could do. She's a sweet lady, but she really will put you to sleep. Doesn't use the book, don't even bother.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: HAA115<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought this class was really boring, the dim lights and powerpoint every single day wants to put you to sleep. However, the professor is extremely smart. She knows her stuff really well, there is a a loooot of material to cover! dont even buy textbooks, cuz you wont even use them. the midterm was really easy if you STUDY the midterm review.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2008<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay, she is the worst professor I've ever had. She is incredibly boring and has long pauses during lectures that cause the class to drag, and drag. And for the paper, don't expect to know any of the works because they are nothing like what was discussed in class. Plus, she never went over how to write an art history paper. I do not reccommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is sooo boring, if you don't get your coffee before class, you might bring your pillow. Her exams are extremly hard, where she will make you memorize things you won't need for the exam.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: ART250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow...she is horrible...This class was the biggest waste of time ever.  she can not teach at all.  I came out of that class knowing nothing.  Her exams are hard and at a level that she is at.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her tests are a challenge because you have to keep up with a lot of readings and also take good class notes, but she is a lenient, generous, and understanding professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2007<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although nice and terribly apologetic, she is a HORRIBLE teacher. She cancelled class 4 times, wasting our money. We were to cover Japan, China and India.. and we were still on Japan at week 7. No syllabus and we made our OWN final project...which she gave no guidelines for and then graded poorly. Avoid her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>work load is light, but the exams are hard. lectures can get a little boring, but she is a really nice lady and means well. only take her if you are actually interested in the subject.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: ART340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does not know how to teach, also does not know how to present the class material.

You would think after years of teaching, she would know how to speak in front of a class. She gives a ridiculous amount of reading at one time and if you are NOT an art or art history major, you will not be able to follow references she makes, and will make you feel worse than the rest of the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2006<br>Class Name: BUDDHISTART<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take!
