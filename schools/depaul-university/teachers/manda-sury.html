No direction in class, just goes over book slides.  Seems to wing every lecture.  Worst experience in my program this far.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: FIN662<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please don't take him. You are better off doing an independent study.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2009<br>Class Name: FIN617<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I normally take reviews with a grain of salt as most are negative.  However, this teacher warrants a negative review.  It's a self study course as his teaching is worthless.  He doesn't answer emails or show up to office hours.  Arrives late to class.  I could go on but bottom line: DO NOT TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2008<br>Class Name: FIN617<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher ever.  Showing up to class was a waste of time.  We never worked through example problems and there was no structure to his lectures.  He spent most of his time trying to play with the &quot;cool&quot; technology we had in the room.  If I had wanted an independent study I would have signed up for one.  Absolute waste of my money.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2008<br>Class Name: FINA330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is extremely knowledgeable and uses real world examples to support his lectures!  Finance is difficult no matter who teaches it to you -- and it's so much material, so keeping up is a must!!  I agree with the other poster who said &quot;This prof truly cares for his students&quot;.   For those who complained, beware:  YOU HAVE TO READ IN COLLEGE :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2008<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Taking him now and it's the worst mistake i've ever done in my whole life. stay away from him. Average of first quiz we had was a 3 out of 10 and he said the first quiz is the easiest one.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2008<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do Not Take This Teacher....Waste of money and time.

Just like the previous comments, you have to read the book to understand, but the book itself can be complicated. He is somewhat disorganized and doesn't email you back asap. Passable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2008<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor he really cares about the students and he knows his stuff.  He and his son, the other Professor Sury are actualy in the business and so he has a lot of real world references that help a lot in understanding the material.  But yes, you do have to keep up with the reading!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dont know I don't think this guy is good at what he's teaching! he's knows what  he is talking about but didn't make much sense to me! It's kinda ridiculous after the 5th week in class and you're still lost....i dont know be prepare to teach urself from the book........</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
