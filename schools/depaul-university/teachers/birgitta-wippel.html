I would never take a class from her again and she really made me reconsider my major. I hated going to the class because she was really annoying, didn't seem to know what she was talking about and was condescending to students who offered opinions she didn't agree with.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: CMN251<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I will agree that she will help you. but people are entitled to their opinions about teachers and If their teaching style and accent is preventing them from teaching the class then it should be taken into consideration. She is a rookie, her test are hard and she totally sneaks things in on the test.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: ORGCOMM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: COM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She&#8217;s really annoying.  She actually brought a whistle to class in an attempt to control us. Everything is on PowerPoint so pretty much anyone could teach this stuff.  I&#8217;m not a Com. major but if I were I&#8217;d think about changing my concentration.  Try to avoid this nut job.

HAS TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE SUBJECT MATTER FUN. She can become dry and force the class to drag. Also has trouble controlling the class, embarass a few students and that will stop. TOATAL ROOKIE</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2004<br>Class Name: CMN251<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree!

She does everything on powerpoint so it gets boring sometime. Overall she is very nice and helpful</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2004<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really didn't think this class was that bad.  I've been in harder ones before.  Her accent can get annoying and she's not all that organized, but not as bad as a some people think.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2004<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never NOT had at least one good thing to say about a teacher. Because of Wippel, I am no longer minoring in Communications. Everything she does irritates me...unclear, unsure of herself, class is monotonous & a joke, and I've honestly learned nada.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2004<br>Class Name: CMNTHEORY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>weird one.  good intention of teaching btu doent go through</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2004<br>Class Name: CMN360<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is boring, and she uses way too many overheads. Papers are a waste of time - her expectations are unclear, and she grades you down for that. Brought too much of her personal life into class. But, she is nice, and generally fairly accessible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2004<br>Class Name: COM361<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I couldn't stand her.  Her tests were ridiculous and the papers were a big waste of time.  She should actually test on what she teaches over and over and over again during her lectures.  And I hated hearing about her kid.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree that her accent is very annoying, and she teaches public speaking, as if she is the one giving a speech.  we go over the same things shes taught everyday.  I learned more in high school, and the class is a waste of time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2004<br>Class Name: 251<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you see wippell's name on the list, you must no matter how much her time fits in your schedule AVOID it.  She is not sexy and her accent is totally annoying.  Her test are not from the book or lectures.  In fact not sure how where they come from.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2004<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the greatest teacher and isn't very clear.  On the other hand she is very sexy.  A nice body and a slight, super sexy Swedish accent.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
