Nonetheless, he was clearly a smart guy and knew what he was talking about.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>JMart is amazing. If you email him at 10pm, he'll respond at 10:02 with lots of helpful info. Some of the assignments are tough, but he helps a lot if you ask. He made Discover and Immersion week so much more fun and informative than I thought they would be. Bit of a tough grader on papers, but not too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2014<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Martin is very qualified to teach journalism and its relationship to the First Amendment.  He has a good variety of assignments (quizzes, papers, projects), but he is not always clear and concise about telling you what is required of you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor! He makes sure that you understand everything that is going on and is flexible with deadlines. Super nice and easy to talk to. Took Free Speech and Free Press in Chicago with him. Made me feel very welcome the first quarter of my freshman year!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
