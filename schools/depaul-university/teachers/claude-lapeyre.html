He really helps you learn to become fluent in french and helps you in every way he can. He is very easy to talk to and very intelligent! My favorite professor at DePaul thus far! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2014<br>Class Name: FCH106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a sweet guy. He teaches his class a bit backwards where you "learn" on your own before he teaches you. But eventually you catch on. Little homework - only the workbook due the day of the test. Let's you use your laptop on the test to check grammar in essays. And always upbeat and entertaining in class. Would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2013<br>Class Name: FCH104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is hilarious and easy to understand. I took french for six years throughout high school and I feel like I've learned more in one quarter with him than I did in the six years before.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: FCH105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Monsieur Lapeyre is one of the best french professors I've ever had! he is very intelligent- you get more than textbook french from him, you learn a lot about french history, customs, etc. attendance is mandatory, but I looked forward to his class, so it's not terrible to be there everyday.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2008<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is HILARIOUS. So funny, loved going to class. He grades pretty hard but is extremely helpful and offers a lot of extra credit. He is seriously one of the funniest people ever, we were begging him not to go on vacation so we could have him next quarter! TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2008<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
