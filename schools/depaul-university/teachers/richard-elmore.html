Has very extreme views that I'm sure some disagree with but the entire class is discussion. He welcomes other opinions and we rarely actually talk about the assignment.

I took him for a night class and was never bored.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome instructor.  If you like talking about real issues this guy is for you.  He will go on rants about issues but they are on topic.  Mid-term was a paper.

He is absurdly hilarious, incredibly smart, and makes better and more easy going conversation than almost anyone I know. Engaging but reasonable readings, 2 essays (midterm/final), and the funniest stories you will every hear. TAKE ANYYYYY CLASS POSSIBLE WITH HIM.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2012<br>Class Name: PHL240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never rated any professors before but Rick deserves it. He is probably one of the best teachers I have ever had. His classes are fun and interesting. I have been in two of his classes now, and have learned so much. I'm actually sad that I'm graduating because that means I wont get to be in his classes anymore. TAKE HIS CLASS!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2012<br>Class Name: PHL230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Elmore rocks.

Made a 3 hour class super fun and interesting and it flew by. You will learn A LOT, not just about topics in the class, but about the world in general. He's really down to earth and doesn't BS.

One of the best teachers I've ever had at Depaul. Hilarious and easy going. The beginning of class is like watching standup. Class really makes you think, and he always ties it in with current events. One of those classes you look forward to! Just read and participate! Reminds me of Louis C.K!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2011<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Elmore is one of the best teachers I have ever had!  This guy is hilarious, intelligent, witty, and all around amazing.  He has a lot of interesting things to say, and he loves to talk about his family (which was pretty entertaining).  I would definitely recommend him to any DePaul University student.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2010<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher.Makes class very interesting.

Very funny and personable, keeps you up with current events as well as teach. Learn about non-conventional philosphers (plato, etc), which I think is part of what makes this class good as well. Loved his class, always made me laugh/class fun, and overall knew his stuff. Definitely take him you wont regret</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class changed by life. He really makes you think. He's funny and keeps the class interesting always. The workload is ok and the final is a 8-10 page paper but it's based off the readings so it's not hard. Take this class. You wont regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2010<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class load- 3 papers-not bad. The final paper is 8-10 pages though, it should be 4 at the most. The class is def interesting& he keeps you entertained, which is great. He pretty much harasses you to participate in class, I sat in the back and avoided eye contact like a pre- pubesent girl in middle school phys ed. other than that, pretty bad A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly the best teacher I've had at Depaul. He made it actually interesting to learn about philosophy and the workload is not bad at all. He is also a really funny guy. At times it seems like he's doing stand-up comedy up there. Definitely take him if you get the chance. You'll learn alot about philosophy and current events.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really makes the class fun and interesting while making difficult concepts clear.

Hes extremely funny, and has the worst circle drawings I have ever seen. His lectures are pretty fabulous, and he likes to talk about how he works out every morning. I LOVED this class... But he made me feel a little retarded when it came to current events. He really enjoys his brown jacket, long sleeves, and the color orange.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2009<br>Class Name: PHILO100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Taking Professor Elmore should be one of the requirements to graduate.

Loves current events.  Very intelligent.  Hilarious.  Great guy.  He is my friend on facebook.  Rick opened my mind to some social and political issues and is definitely a cut above all the rest.  Goes against the grain.  Just a great guy.  Easy but you learn a LOT!  Papers are easy.  You grade urself</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2009<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Elmore is sarcastic and overly prompt with things that don't often matter. The classroom is very relaxed and he engages the students in conversation, even if it's not fluid with his lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2009<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like people who can't say their W's and people who don't like Hancock for reasons too graphic to write on here, he's your guy.  The class consists of 1 pt daily quizzes,a film paper, a take home midterm, and a take home final.  Read the assignments and you've got a pretty good chance of getting an A as long as you know how to write.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2009<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a character. He is hilarious, and cares about his subject.  I hated philosophy 100 and taking this class completely changed my attitude about the subject.  He pronounces the word &quot;why&quot; as &quot;hawhy&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: PHLMG248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is great! Makes discussion fun and interesting. You not only learn about the subject, but current events. Easy to talk to and very helpful. Just do the easy work he assigns and you'll do well. Goes over the midterm with you and the final was easier than the midterm. Great guy def. going to take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2009<br>Class Name: PHILL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The greatest professor I've even had.
