I usually get As in DePaul English courses, will most likely get a C in Gary's. Highest midterm grade was a 74. Does not accept answers that were not EXACTLY what he was looking for. Nitpicks insignificant details of texts. Talks about book titles for hours. Makes up words. Awful handwriting too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2014<br>Class Name: ENG260<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We spent 15min in class guessing why Faulkner decided to use a square placeholder at the beginning of each chapter. Gary's answer? "There's no reason why. It's arbitrary." And that is what every class is like.

I read every book, took great notes, and still can't get a good grade from him. I had a 4.0 before this class...now I'm terrified for my GPA. Plus he made me as a student feel incredibly uncomfortable for personal reasons. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. You will be miserable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2014<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He uses words that are made up. I'm pretty sure he's se xist. There are 4 papers you have to write all quarter and he assigns them so that you have two at a time... during midterms and finals time. He doesn't accept any answers that aren't exactly what he was thinking. Overall my least favorite class so far.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid at all costs, especially if you are interested in social justice issues. This professor is woefully out of date, not knowledgeable about the subject, and aggressive towards students who disagree with him. He reinforces stereotypes instead of breaking them down, and asks vague questions and gets angry when people don't understand him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200132<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I specifically signed up for this site in order to provide a rating for Professor Smith. As a third-year student at DePaul, Smith has been the worst professor I have ever encountered. I read every book on time, attended every single class, and studied for hours, yet couldn't achieve higher than a B- in the course. Do not take this course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Scatterbrained, ill informed, combative with students who ask questions he doesn't know the answer to.

His tests are hard but not impossible. Its essentially impossible to get below a C, and he was always friendly to me. His rating is significantly lower than it should be.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2013<br>Class Name: ENG363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take him if you don't want to read, which I shouldn't have to say for English majors.

He is a really easy teacher and makes sure his students have everything they need done for the midterm.  He wants his students to do well.  He also gives a review for the midterm and final, which always for you to see what the tests will be like.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2012<br>Class Name: ENG365<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have a photographic memory that allows you to memorize entire novels; a telepathic ability to understand convoluted, poorly communicated, and generally incorrect analyses, have an un-intimidating intellect, and don't mind brown nosing, Professor Smith may reward you with a B. Maybe.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Greatest professor i have ever taken.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love him.

You write a couple two page journals and read some books.  There is nothing hard about that for college.  He is not a tough grader.  He curved the midterm and made sure everyones midterm had all the points he wanted.  He wants his students to make sure they get the best grade possible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2011<br>Class Name: EGL265<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never disliked a teacher enough to rate them- until Prof. Smith. In a 200-level class, over half of the class (all English majors) dropped after the first exam because the highest score was so low. He is pompous, condescending, obnoxious, and hypercritical enough to give Shakespeare a C. My grade was one of the highest: a B. AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>PLEASE DON'T TAKE. i am telling you this as a person who NEVER believes rate my professor. however, i should have listened with this professor. this class took up all my study time and has nothing to do with my major. it is WAY too much work for a required learning domain.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures made me wonder what I was really supposed to be learning. When exam time came we panicked because the exam had nothing to do with what we discussed in class. He assumed we memorized the books & could recognize random quotes and explain them. He should realize that LSP is required and most students are not english majors. I agree AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2010<br>Class Name: ABD290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smith is a tough grader and says a lot of things that makes White people uncomfotable but he's not there to coddle them. Lot's of things he says are true. He's a difficult grader but if you go to him he will help you. I'd recommend any class you take with him to be audited that way you don't have to deal with a grade from  him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely the worst teacher ever and a disgrace to DePaul.  Very closed-minded.  Half of his &quot;interpretations&quot; make no sense.  IMPOSSIBLY difficult grader because he doesn't consider any answers feasible except for his own.  Looks down on students, does not trust them at all, very patronizing.  This man should not be allowed to teach.  Avoid!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2009<br>Class Name: ENG372<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Obviously knowledgeable about the subject but nearly impossible grader. Said of my 1st essay &quot;1 of best 2 in class&quot;... and I got a B.  Highest midterm grade in class was an 82%. You will gain exposure to wide variety of texts and history, but he gets lost in pointless tangents. Has made borderline offensive comments in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID AT ALL COSTS! i thought he was just quirky and funny at first, but he is horrendous. 2/3 of our class dropped after the midterm. he is unfocused, you can't read his handwriting, he makes up words and terms and  arbitrarily guesses grades. he has no rubric or basis for any grades, and picks favorites. stay away</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: HST101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for a multicultural class and the man is a flaming ****s...he told that class that white people were scared to live in the city because there were drugs and black people...the man is an idiot and should be fired i am reporting him to the dean for all of the completely scandalous things that he said in my class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor! I think he grades hard for the hell of it. No matter how hard i tried on my papers, it was never enough. Half of the time he draws the map of &quot;United States&quot; on the board. Don't recommend this class for an ISP course. HORRIBLE. He tries to look down on studnets when they ask questions. HIs opinion is by far the only opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2008<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I tried to avoid him, but I had no other choice if I wanted to graduate on time.  He is a total pedant: he teaches solely to show you how smart he is and how stupid he thinks you are.  I worked my butt of in his class, but only got a B. He told tell us stuff that could be easily disproved & you are only right if your opinion is his own. AVOID HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have to admit this class was difficult, but I thoroughly enjoyed Gary Smith and his teachings.

He completely belittled my work and told me he doesn't believe in A's.

Instead, I thought that no teacher could be this bad. The fact of the matter is that he is angry, self-righteous, not interested in knowing that you can think, and can't follow his syllabus.
