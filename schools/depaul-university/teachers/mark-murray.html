Good Luck!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2013<br>Class Name: LEADERSHIP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark is a wonderful professor. He truly wants to help and make your time in his class worthwhile. He's friendly and funny making class fly by and the content is super interesting. I would recommend him over anyone else at DePaul.

I can't say enough great things about the man. Discover arts and culture was such a great class, and everything I learned felt so worthwhile, unlike a lot of other discover classes, in which the material was pointless.

He really made my Discover Class an enjoyable one. I'm so glad I had him as a teacher. The Discover week really opened my eyes to new things, even as a native Chicagoan. Highly recommend taking one of his classes. Nice guy. The classwork was easy. I would love to be his student mentor either next year or my junior year.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: ISP150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher...felt he definitely provided me with career tools that i was lacking.  all around great person, and highly recommend him and his class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor.  My favorite at DePaul.  Very helpful and keeps the class interesting.  I highly encourage everyone to take at least one of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2005<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is so cool! He has got to be one of the few normal professors left on this planet or at DePaul University. He brings real life into the classroom and makes you learn. I would definitely take his class again and recommend anyone else to also.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2004<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first he's hard to figure out. He'll say something to you and you wont know if he's joking or pissed off... you'll find 9 times out of 10 he's just being funny. Doesn't ask much, just that everyone puts effort into what he asks for. Great guy. I would love to take another class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2004<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark is a down to earth guy who will help you when you need it. Some people cant distinguish if he is funny or if he is an ass, but his humor is never intended to hurt only to help. He wants you to put effort into the class and not just &quot;show up&quot;. Would make a good proffesional wrestler.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy and funny guy who mas the class seem short.    As long as you post on Blackboard, you will get all of the discussion points (20% of grade).  The papers are fairly easy.  The same goes for the portfolio.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2004<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2004<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, i had a ton of fun attending class and would advocate to anyone taking their Junior Year Experiential to give Prof.Murray a try.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
