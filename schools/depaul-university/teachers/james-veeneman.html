Not only did we work on numerous projects that weren't evealuated in any way the professor was a constant name dropper in a bad way.  He eluded to experiences in banking but had no subsatnce in real business or accounting.  Poor class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2010<br>Class Name: ACC502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. One of the best class I have ever had at DePaul. Not only the theories we learned but also be applied in the real world. The teaching of this class might be different with other business classes. A lot of readings, hard work,etc. You will earn a good grade if you follow his logic. I had enjoyable time in this class. Good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2009<br>Class Name: ACC542<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had a friend take this class and warn me about him.  He was all over the place, telling lots of personal anecdotes that didn't always connect to the topics.  I didn't really learn much in this class and didn't care to spend much time preparing. He was entertaining though. Related stuff back to current events.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2009<br>Class Name: ACC502<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy was a joke. Virtually no feedback was received on any of the lengthy weekly assignments or the midterm paper. Some weeks this course seemed more like macro-economics than management accounting. Also, it was extremely nauseating to listen to him go on about his fundraising trips for the University of Chicago and the constant name dropping.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2009<br>Class Name: ACC502<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The WORST professor in DePaul. He always talked about something that not related to class. Also interrupted when you answered his question. He didn't follow the syllabus at all. A lot of homework and extra papers. You'll never how he graded.  He is an UNFAIR GRADER with no reason.  I got nothing from this class. Only paid $3,160 for A-.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2008<br>Class Name: ACC502<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Complete waste of my tuition money.  All he talked about were his trips to S. America, his family, and how great the University of Chicago is.  I learned next to nothing.  It is very unfortunate that he is the only one teaching this class, because it is a required class for the Management Accouting concentration.  Don't take if you want to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: ACC542<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Veeneman sucks for Cost Accounting 542. Plusses: he?s funny and dresses sharp.  Downsides:  Doesn?t keep his word ?he told our class that only certain things would be on the final, then tested us on other topics anyway.  Copious amounts of homework.  Favors weaker students.  Wastes time on useless material. Very disorganized.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher ever.

Sooo eassyyy!!! Honestly, I had to take a class with McCarthy a semester before taking this professor, and let me just say that I am very happy I dropped that idiot McCarthy for Acct. 303.

Understands Cost Accounting very well. Willing to help everyone do well in the class. However, EXCESSIVE on the homework.

He is without a doubt the best accounting teacher I have ever had. He works you hard but it is for a reason. He wants you to be the best and that is exactly what you become.

I spent about 15+ hrs to do them.  That's b/c i was going for an A.  Otherwise, pretty funny guy, shares lots of stories, and relates acctg to everything.  Still, i dont regret taking the course.

I think he has a lot to offer and I learned a lot.  That said, do not take ACC 555 in the summer, it's a ton of work.   V also needs to follow up on what he says he's going to do and be more organized.

Strongly recommend but be advised, the work level for ACC555 is extremely high if not excessive.  I typically multiplied his weekly estimates by a factor of 2-3.

Networked, highly intelligent, and a great motivator.  Take at least one class with him.  He is the poster child of how a professional business person carries themseselves.  It was a simple C.
