He cares about you and what you want to write about. In WRD 104 we are creating our own editing toolkits to use in other classes. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic professor.  Requires you to meet with him at least twice throughout the semester to personally critique and assist you with your writings.  Inspired me to keep stick with my major.  Extremely helpful</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Moore's class can be challenging due to the amount of reading and the constant revising but I had both 103 and 104 with him and it paid off. I feel I am a far better writer now than I was a year ago. Class discussions are good. Fair grader. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just finishing up this course this week and I loved it.

Just read the emails! :-) Good class, though. Some grown up stuff going on there.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Michael is the best. His emails get annoying, but whatever. You read the NY Times instead of a text book... That itself could make it a 5. I met with him a few times during office hours and we had great conversations. He got really mad at me once, but was very opening to working out our differences when I met with him. Take it, you'll love him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing guy, he really CARES about his students. I took him for both WRD requirements, and so did half of my class. Your textbook is The New York Times, which is actually super fun! AMAZING teacher, take him! (P.S. he brings you cupcakes and OJ—what's not to love?)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Michael 2 times for the freshman writing courses and I am so happy that I did. I use to hate writing and now I love the challenge. If you let him, Michael is a great, influential teacher that will help you reach your goals and make you a "critical thinker."</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class! Take it with Mr. Moore if you can. Worthwhile in general and great for specific college writing tasks. And you get to read the New York Times, which is better than it sounds!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite professor I've ever taken! He took a personal interest in each of his students, loved talking to us, no fluff to his teachings, and the assignments were based on what we were interested in. He's an inspiring teacher with a great outlook on his student's lives. Do everything you can to take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher, take advantage of office hours and ask lots of questions. If you put the work in your grade will reflect it. Michael is an attentive and considerate teacher with a lot of respect for students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>fantastic class! since you're required to take a WRD 104  class, I HIGHLY recommend his! We read the NY Times every week and discussed it in class. Definitely my favorite teacher at DePaul He is always willing to help with your papers. I learned so much from this class that also applies to other classes! so good! Just do the work and you'll be good</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I definitely recommend Michael Moore for anyone-writers or non-writers. He conducts the class through reading the New York Times and a few, easy-to-do assignments. He engages his students in worldly and relevant news; he is a great, passionate, friendly, and welcoming professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super helpful and has a very down to earth personality.

A lot of writing and drafts and revising and editing, but you're usually happy with what you end up with. The best part is the readings, from art, fashion, news, politics, technology, stuff from your major, and a lot on "the purpose of college."</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the most interesting professor I have had. He constantly challenges you to be a more informed and intelligent person. He has very basic requirements for AT LEAST a B in his class. He makes you try, not to get an A, but because you want to try (which inevitably leads to an A anyways). Not a boring class at all. You're lucky if you get him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just came from the last day of class. This is the best class (and not the easiest)  I have ever had in H.S. or at DePaul. This is what college should be like.THANK YOU MICHAEL! <3</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best freaking professors and people you could ever have in class! Always makes learning in his class interesting and always interested in what you have to say. Great feedback and help with the assignments he gives. Easy grader and gives very little workload.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a good class if you take it with Moore. A combination of academic writing and challenging critical thinking. He keeps it interesting by using the New York Times instead of a textbook, and encourages you to make your own conclusions. Great class. Lots of writing and editing, but that's okay, because he uses technology and visual rhetoric.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Compared to my other friends in WRD103, Michael Moore's approach to the class was delightful. If you want your WRD103 experience to be easy and stress-free, with a professor that is WILLING to sit down and listen and help with every assignment, go for him. There really is no professor that could be better.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're someone who's concerned with maintaining a high GPA, I would definitely not recommend taking Michael's class. He's an interesting person, but he is very unclear about grading and he wastes class time with meaningless discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best teacher ive ever had. Teaches in a context that is applicable to real life. Are text book was the New York Times and class is about whatever you tell him your interested in. He is liberal and does not believe in letter grades. Learned the most in this class than any other and is not difficult and enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Michael is one of the best people to meet at DePaul. I was not excited to take his class because I hate academic writing. This class was the first class freshman year that made me feel like I actually was in college. You write about what you want to write about and Michael is there to back you 10000%. Just take his class. You won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Michael is an amazing professor and person.

His assignments are really simple and generally he gives high grades if you gave the effort. He looks for creativity and always enjoys a good laugh! Our final project was a choice project and the final was a portfolio. He made turning our portfolios a party</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He genuinely cares about his students' lives outside the academia. Jovial and amiable, Professor Moore enjoys negotiating with his students on how to get an A. He likes class discussions and is very open minded. Homework amount: Reasonable (Once a week/every 2 weeks) My favourite class of the year!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of a stickler for details.

His class is really laid back.. He lets you text and use your computers during class. You do a couple different writing projects, but they are all actually interesting and kinda fun to do. If you can, take him for WRD 103 or 104 because most other teachers are AwFuL</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
