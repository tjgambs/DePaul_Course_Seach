U will certainly get A if U work all assignments intentionally and submit them on time. However, if U are not good at English listening,please pay more attention because he speaks veryyy fast. It's the most interesting course I have ever taken.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor.  Learned more in 5 week class than some of my full quarter classes.  He brings excellent insight and group projects are great.  Truly a class that was disappointing that it was over.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/08/2007<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He definetly easy, the class is easy and he practically gives you free points for anything he can think of. I'm a C student and I got a 100% in the class without any stress or trying and I missed at least 25% of the class.  He is very nice, and you will actually enjoy going to his class where you will actually learn useful information.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2007<br>Class Name: MGT572<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor!  Likes to talk and engage in group discussion.  Makes requirements flexible so class is more interesting an d fun.  Sometimes he gets off course a bit and starts rambling, but definitely worth the easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME professor! Lots of reading, but no exams. Dr. Barlowe is extremely laid-back, easily accessible outside of class and he tells great stories! I definitely recommend taking this class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2007<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Barlow was able to make an 8 hour class on Saturday super interesting when it could have been very boring.  He did a great job of mixing lecture with group work and the discussions were very engaging and relavent to real life.  Would recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2006<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Barlow is awesome!  Knows tons, classes are very interesting and you get to meet tons of people even if you're shy.  Material is real-world and very applicable and the class is a breeze - interesting, informative, and useful!  Take him, he's awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2006<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows a lot about very different fields. His classes are fascinating, innovative and funny. He promotes teamwork and wants you to learn from that experience. He likes to receive feedback. A lot of homework but no tests. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are lively, plenty of amusing anecdotes (although you may hear some repeats).  Focuses more on interpolating concepts rather than rote learning, which is a good approach to this type of class.  Grading is point-based, with plenty of opportunity to make up shortfalls. Try to stay in a small (3-4 people) groups for the project.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a GREAT teacher.
