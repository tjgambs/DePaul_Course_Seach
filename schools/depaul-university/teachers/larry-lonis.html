Prof Lonis has tons of experience w/different jobs that he relates to class topics. He can be confusing with the amount of data and instructions he gives, but he is willing to help at any time. Highly recommend this class and professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2010<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is a very hard class that incorporates everything you've learned in your finance classes. His tests are hard and somewhat confusing. You need to do a lot of reading to do well. The final project is about 60 pages (writing and exhibits). He will guide you with excell templates and instructions,but don't leave everything for the last minute.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice old guy BUT his teaching style is the worst ever. Quiz, midterm and 50pg. paper at the end. Still uses the overhead and reads of the slides. Love the subject but couldn't learn anything in class. Did all learning on my own at home. Would've taken someone else if    knew all this ahead of time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2009<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A ton of work, most of it data gathering as opposed to data analyzing. Didn't learn how to analyze a company as much as we learned how to compile data in a manner in which the professor likes to view it. Instructions and expectations were vague, making it difficult to understand how grade was determined. Professor is a nice guy, but poor teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2009<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best professor so far ....a great himan being..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: FIN526<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy with a lot of good real world information to share with his students. the topics were interesting. his tests were really long but they were fair and he gave an accurate description of what to study beforehand.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Watch out.. very difficult class, prof is not very helpful. Vague instructions for papers and class lectures are only slightly helpful. 3 papers due, at a min 60 pgs. long. More work then any other class I've taken.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2007<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy rockz!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2005<br>Class Name: FIN<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
