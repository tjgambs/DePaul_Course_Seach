Do yourself a favor and take a course with Bibiana, you'll learn a lot, and she will go out of your way to help you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very sweet person.  The work isn't too difficult, but she is a hard grader sometimes.  The class was interesting, but she loves to talk.  She is also bad at managing her time.  A few fieldtrips and art projects.  Overall good class and good teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: FIGUREDRAWING<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was one of the best 2 figure drawing teachers I have had.  She helped lay the foundation forall my art skills and taught how to draw things the proper classic way.  If you want to be a better realistic artist, she is a must have.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: PAINTING<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not one for experimintation.  She has a set style and will only work within that and will not work with anyone who wants to take a differnt direction.  Basically she is difficult with advanced students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2005<br>Class Name: ART394<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh, I love this little lady.
