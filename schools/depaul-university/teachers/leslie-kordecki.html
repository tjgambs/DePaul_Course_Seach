She wants you to succeed. If you read, you'll do great. That's it. Read the stuff and talk about it, and she will provide you with any resources, advice, and suggestions you need for the papers. She will help you out. She rocks.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2015<br>Class Name: ENG381<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the BOMB. I highly recommend taking any class with her. Not only is Literary Theory super interesting and very useful for English majors, she encourages really interesting and helpful class discussion. Do the reading, be prepared to participate, and ask questions when you don't understand-- she is SO open to other people's ideas! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2013<br>Class Name: ENG383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Leslie Kordecki is amazing. I took three classes with her and continued to be taken with her intelligence. She will help you with anything. She is always available and very caring. She is also hilarious so her class goes by very quickly and you will remember what you learn. You will not regret taking a course with her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2012<br>Class Name: ENG329<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's such an intelligent woman and explains the subject very well and clearly. She's quirky and far from being a dry lecturer. She's a tough but fair grader, but that's to be expected in a 300lvl class. She is a passionate on the subject and is willing/wants to help her students succeed. I definitely plan on taking her again</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Diddo to the post below. I love her, she's a sharpshooter! <3 Both her and McQuade are hands down the best ENG professors.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2010<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful teacher.  She's caring, passionate, cute, intelligent, laid back, and extremely funny.  I laughed in class everyday.  She makes an entire semester of Shakespeare seem like a breeze.  I'm extremely happy to have taken this class with her.  She's very clear about her expectations, and very receptive to feedback.  Gives good feedback too!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: ENG329<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kordecki's class was the most fun in a DePaul course I've had yet.  Fair, intelligent, willing to work with students (as opposed to against them), truly interested in her subject area -- and funny! All I could've asked for in a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2010<br>Class Name: ENG379<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a great sense of humor and had some great quips I actually wrote down. She uses all books and materials that she assigns, which is nice. She is very helpful and approachable. She really engages the class and keeps everyone interested with her passion and attitude.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2009<br>Class Name: ENG472<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kordecki is smart and engaging in a topic that can be very difficult for even the most passionate English students to get through: Literary Criticism. She teaches the class with a perfect balance of humor, encouragement and thoughtfulness.  She is open to her students being creative and trying new  ideas even in essays and final papers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2009<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awful. ,My class was full of stuck up English students who showed off their intelligence. Kordecki plays favorites, hard grader, will call on you when you don't have your hand raised. Not much help either. But she will use the textbook assigned, so it's not a waste of money to purchase. I would strongly advise you not to take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes pretty funny but very critical and condesdending-also a hard grader, but than again i don't think she cared for me. i'd say it was a so-so class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really funny and opinionated. If you are wrong she will always tell you, which is kind of nice.  However, this class is really difficult, and if you dont LOVE LOVE poetry, do NOT take it.  The papers and the exams are difficult and she's a hard grader.  Nice teacher, class is hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a good sense of humor and is approachable.  You can argue in a paper what you believe a poem may be about and if she does not agree she will not accept your opinion.  She is nice but she is one of those people who will flat out tell you &quot;no&quot; if she thinks you are wrong.  If poetry is diffictult for you to understand, be weary.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2006<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Always a pleasure.  Knows a whole lot about shakespeare and medieval lit., definitely leans towards feminist criticism, just a fun class.  A pretty forgiving grader.  I want to be her when I grow up.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2006<br>Class Name: GRAD<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She made Arthurian Romance interesting, which I find amazing.  She has a fun sense of humor and class is lighthearted.  I really enjoyed her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She can be fun but she can also be irritating and condescending.  There were 2 papers and an INSANE exam for a 200 level course.  Take her if you are REALLY REALLY into the scientific aspect of poetry; avoid her if you're not.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: SHAKESPEARE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2006<br>Class Name: MEDIEVALLIT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very witty and engaging, she makes medieval lit fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: ENG310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes medieval literature interesting!
