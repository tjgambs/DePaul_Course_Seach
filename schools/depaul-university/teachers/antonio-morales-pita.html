Always there to help, won't let you sit in class and say nothing. Makes you work for your grade, so it isn't a blow off class.

Half of the class withdrew and most that stayed ended up failing. He seemed to play favorites and a select few got good grades.

People need to stop complaining about college being difficult. He has really high standards, many kids dropped after midterm which is 35% of grade and almost no one got and A.

He is enthusiastic but he's incomprehensible. I had to struggle to try and understand what he was saying, and by the time I decoded it- he moved on to something else. He often tries to talk about Cuba and sell his book, which have no relation to the class.

Be prepared: he calls on people at random to &quot;summarize&quot; what he just said.  I really didn't like being put on the spot, but he does give extra credit opportunities.  He is ok in general.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want an easy A, then take a different professor.  If you want to learn important economic ideals and be prepared for the business world, then take this guy.  Even if you are a non-business mager, he really makes you understand economics.  He is a little difficult to understand, but you'll get used to it.  I still remember what he taught me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2007<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow (in the worst way possible) okay if you get a poor grade on your mid term drop the class even if you tells you to stay. I and many other people stayed bc that’s what he advised and we all FAILED.

I would take him again, but I wouldn't recommend him to non-business majors.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So I posted the evaluation below. I was not doing very well in the class so I asked him to help me out..and he wrote me the nastiest e-mail in the world. Obviously he doesn't care about the students who are not into economics or don't 100% enjoy his class. Again..if you are not a majour RUN fast. P.S.

He is clear in that respect, however when it comes to the non-majours..run as fast as you can. He teaches in a way that assues that you have prior econ. knowledge. Doing the study ques. are useless and the seminars are free points..find another pro. unless u r a majour.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: INT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, great teacher.

I get econ very easy and thought I could teach the class.

I reccomend him with flying colors; you won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows what he is talking about but unfortunately no one else does. Read the book!!! do the practice quizes online and you will be ok; If you listen to him, you will ONLY get confused and get lost in concepts which are easy to understand as long as he doesn't explain them. Don't argue with him, it will do u no good.I highly recommend against him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for 105 and taking him for 106. He knows the material inside and out. Midterm and Final count for most of total grade and he attendance counts for the rest. He is a sweet old man and his book is very good. I recommend this class to students who have a good work ethic and are smart--not for those seeking an easy A and are lazy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am not one to **** about professors here at Depaul but this man is completely unclear, arrogant and one of the hardest graders I have ever had.  I would not suggest him to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a horrible teacher.  First of all he tries to make everyone buy his book.  Second of all, if you want an A, honestly good luck.  He does not give any partial credit and his final is a lot harder than his mid-term, so if you get a good grade on the midterm, dont think you definitely have an A (that's what I thought).  95 is an A Its hard</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably one of the best professors I've had at DePaul so far. He goes out of his way in order to help his students understand the material. He is very smart, and has ALOT of credentials (just google his name). Get on his good side, participate in class, ask questions when you don't understand and you will do just fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible Professor...grade is based off semianrs..midterm...final!! Midterm few pass..doesnt curve because he thinks that nobody tried but its really because he doesnt know how to teach. Needs to stop thinking he is better than everyone else and start teaching. Never will meet with you outside of class because it is not worth his time. Do not Take!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Usually people who say &quot;worst professor ever,&quot; probably didn't put enough effort into the class, but this man was impossible.  He is un-sympathetic and unfair.  The mid-term was ridiculous with few people passing.  Micro. should be the easiest subject, but he makes it more difficult than it should be.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Morales-Pita is the best.  He is a man of passion, and it's quite obvious he has a passion for teaching.  He explains economics extremely well, and will continue to go over something until he is sure it is understood by everyone.  He wants to be there and makes me want to be in class too.  A man of rare intelligence and class, he is a pleasur</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher!!  He really goes above and beyond what any other teacher does as far as explaining the material.  He cares about his students and wants to give them all A's.  If you do the work and read, ull get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible but kinda cute.

He will not even discuss grades.

The guy is really smart, and you can really tell he loves this subject.  I will probably take him for every Economics class I have.  He also wrote a really awesome book about his journey from Cuba.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2006<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The comment above is right....he seems like a nice guy....but he is not. His tests are vague so you have no ideas what he is going to test you on. ..and when it comes to grades he is horrible...he will not change anything and he is extremely rude as well. I had a horrible experience with him and this was just a summer class! DONT TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend students to take as economics professor. Although, grades are mostly based on Mid-term and Final--35% each and 30% participation and attendence.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Morales comes off as a kind and energetic man, but when it comes time to dispute grades or his ideas look out!!  He goes off on a power trip and ruins your day!  Avoid if possible... he needs to get over himself!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE MORALES! Truly cares about his students, will stop at nothing to make sure everyone understands. He posts all the notes on Blackboard and although your grade is 2 tests and participation, the tests arent bad if you pay attention in class and at the review sessions, 'seminars.'  One of the best professors I've had, worth the trip to the loop!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2006<br>Class Name: MICRO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough in the fact that you only have two tests to make your grade. Attendance is worth 30% and each test worth 35%. So if you screw up a test its bad news. Very enthusiastic about teaching, however. Nice and respectful guy also.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2005<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my 2rd time taking this class.First time i got a D and didnt understand anything. I wish i would have taken him first.Such a nice man and is highly intelligent.

Will stop to make sure everything is understood.  Very thorough in his lectures.

But by taking good notes and attending class you can do well. Sit in front of class and make sure he knows your name. It's in benefit to you that he does!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring as hell. His lectures do not go with what he puts on his tests. Has a thick accent that makes it hard to understand sometimes. One Final and one midterm which makes it okay i guess.

He loves teaching so much.  He is funny in his own way, very cute in a grandpa kind of way.  His class is not hard.  He takes attendence, but it counts as a good part of the final grade... It is possible to get b's on the midterm and final and an a or a- in the class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this guy, yeah he has a thick accent, but he is an absolutely adorabale old man, a good, funny teacher, just go to class and pay attention, you'll be fine.
