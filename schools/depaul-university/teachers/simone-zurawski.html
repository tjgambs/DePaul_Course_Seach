All you are expected is to write as much as you know about a piece of art that's shown in a slideshow in exams. Lectures are long. She's really savvy in what she teaches, but could be confusing sometimes. No home works so that's a good thing. Being in the class and trying to focus on lectures is important.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2015<br>Class Name: HAA238<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very enthusiastic, but doesn't actually teach much</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2014<br>Class Name: HAA236<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>I love her! She is very passionate about the subject! Very clear and very helpful outside of class! Take advantage of the extra credit! Doesn't like you to eat, sleep, or leave class at all. Also no cell phone usage and make sure you study for the quiz and exams! Really study, if you are looking for an easy A, don't take class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2013<br>Class Name: HON205FRENCHIM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely pretentious and uninspiring. If you don't worship the French culture and think art is the only reason to live, she will probably inadvertently insult you, and you will feel miserable in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2012<br>Class Name: HAA238<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simone is an amazingly passionate teacher. It's clear that she teaches a subject she loves and if you pay attention then you will have all the tools you need for a good grade. She's easy-going and always offers opportunities for extra credit. Don't be a rude student (on your phone, sleeping) and don't eat in class and you'll be just fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2011<br>Class Name: HAA238<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is great. She has such interesting stories that makes art history really interesting. She will get mad at you if you eat, leave, sleep, or use your phone. I had the best experience at DePaul in her classes</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2010<br>Class Name: HAA220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously Professor Zurawski is a force to be reckoned with. I've never made her upset, but from observing, NEVER eat, leave, or sleep. Not that you should either way, but WHOA. She's super intense one on one too hah. GREAT professor though. You will get your money's worth without fail. She's entertaining too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2010<br>Class Name: HAA237<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely good at what she does. She's really into her topic and that exuberance comes out in her lectures. Attendance and attention is mandatory, as she gives out lots of info that's not in the nightly reading. Exams and papers tough, but not unreasonably so.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2009<br>Class Name: ART258<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am probably the only business major that actually enjoyed the class.  Simone is great at what she does.  She KNOWS her**** about art.  Very nice lady.  Crystal clear slides.  DONT fall asleep, show up late, or miss class.  Study & suck up and she will give you a good grade!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2009<br>Class Name: HAA247<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken her twice and probably will again. She makes sitting in a dark room staring at pictures fun! Don't ever leave class early though, she will take you outside and rip you a new one. Same goes for &quot;sleeping in class&quot; The exams are intense but there is minimal reading. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: HAA238<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>let this be a message to all who dont desire to major in art, and are interested in fulfilling a requirment by taking this course.dont.....unless you want a C. I have gotten A's in every english class I have taken at DePaul, and this lady's tests require writing out an entire bluebook, I studied, wrote very well and ended up with a C. She is crazy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2008<br>Class Name: ITARENA<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>okay i had the hugget lady and this teacher is far more interesting and easier... i did not study for her practice and got a D but then i got a B on mid and final and final paper so ended up with a B but simply put she gives you the slide list and you just need to memorize it...but if you're overwhelmed with other classes she'll make it easier 4 u</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: ART241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Zurawski really knows what she is talking about, and she makes learning about Art interesting, exciting, and often gave us the deails and history you would have a hard ime finding anywhere else. Don't take her classes if you cannot make a commitment to be there or if you don't plan on doing a good amount of studying for the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2008<br>Class Name: ART237<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was soured on Art History classes from my last prof.  Who was a scatterbrained ninny.  Simone is just the opposite.  The lectures made sense.  She actually gave you a slide list.  And her grading scale was fair.  Just don't show up late or ditch class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2008<br>Class Name: ART237<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The first day I was late (by minutes) and she scolded me, but Simone has become one of the greatest teachers I have had at DePaul (and I am a senior). She is an amazing art professor, and does not try to trick students. Fair grading, and a pleasure to be around. Very informed, and very cultured... I only wish more human beings were like her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2008<br>Class Name: ART232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher! NEVER leave class early, she will stop class, take you outside and chew you out. Other than that she is incredible, makes Art History extremely entertaining!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2008<br>Class Name: ART232<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed her class and I learned a lot.  Some may think she is a bit intense, but she really isn't, its just the first impression.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2007<br>Class Name: ART241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know how anyone could say she is hard. I got a B in the class, and that's after getting no credit on the only quiz, completely pulling the midterm out of my ass, and turning in the final paper late. One of the easiest and most generous professors at DePaul. She seems strict at first but stops caring after a couple of weeks.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2006<br>Class Name: ITA200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Zurawski was one of the best professors I have had at DePaul.  She is not only a wonderful teacher, who makes lectures very interesting..but also extremely intelligent, knowledgable on art history, and very helpful.  She provides a very stimulating class structure.  I learned so much from her lectures, and got a fair grade without doing much</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: ART241<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first impression, I couldn't stand her.  However, she does grow on a student if you frequent class.  But overall, I think her grading is too hard (I got an A - in a 300 level art class and I got a B+ in her 200 level class).  That may be a small difference for those who don't work at school at all.  Take her, but expect to work your ass off</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: ART275<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT GO THERE! Unless you are like really into being bored and watching slides in silence. This class was horrible for me. She just talks and talks and talks and is kind of a smug little woman.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2006<br>Class Name: ART241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DONT DO IT! If you're an art history major then go ahead..because I think that's the only way you can get an A in the class. I dreaded every minute of this class and the midterm and assignments are IMPOSSIBLE</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2006<br>Class Name: ART241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont Do It.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2006<br>Class Name: ART244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Omigod.  Simone is in a league of her own.  My friends and I still talk about her.  She knows her stuff like no other but she's got mannerisms that could get on your nerves.  The midterm and final are impromptu essays but they're not too bad, as long as you study.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: ART241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best art history teacher I've had at Depaul...and i've had 5 others. Enthusiastic, knowledgeable and GREAT to take if you're an Art History Minor or Major. She knows so much and gets everyone interested. Uses personal photos as slides too. quiz, midterm, final and paper. If you study and pay attention in class, no problem to get an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2006<br>Class Name: ARTHISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ummm if you like listening to a professor go on and on and on for an hour and a half she is yor teacher. If u hate straight lecture with no break dont take her. I found her class to be extrmely boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2006<br>Class Name: ART366357<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly knowledgeable, engaging lecturer, all around great teacher. She is a *tough* grader - you really have to work for your grade. I was proud of that A-! Take one of her classes before you leave DePaul - you will learn lots!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2006<br>Class Name: ART366<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting lecturer, but she's kind of a tough grader.  It's unclear how she wants you to answer the test questions, I got a B+.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: RENAISSANCE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arbitrary grading. Teaches to the lowest common denominator. Her questions are so dumb, people won't answer them because they don't want to even engage with such lameness. The worst part is that I know she has vast reservoirs of interesting, esoteric knowledge that she just doesn't share. Ask very specific questions and try to drag it out of her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: ARTHISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty hard professor and strict</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2005<br>Class Name: ART241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice professor. really knows her stuff and helps the students to learn more.

She is very intense but she knows her subject and it gets the student interested in the subject.  I personally think she is a great time including great stories with the work of art and spouting out words in french and italian.  I plan on taking every one of her courses.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2005<br>Class Name: ITALIANRENAIS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman cracks me up. She knows so much and speaks so well. The stories she tells that accompany works of art are great and make memorization easier. Lots of RULES: DO NOT be late, no eating... and so on. Misstep and she will call you out in front of everyone. Nonetheless, she's entertaining</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: NORTHREN<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her enthusiasm for the subject and her incredible knowledge makes you want to come to class.

She's a fairly typical art hist. prof. Has a bit of a temper, answers questions like you're a bit slow, but over-all I like the woman. Makes me want to know more about art. Not for slackers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2004<br>Class Name: ART241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow, she is intense and tends to emphasis ends of SENTENCES.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2004<br>Class Name: ITALREN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman cracks me up.
