Books read back in highschool may, at first, appear a waste of time, but Lewis raises questions and issues concerning the reading that academics have just briefly touched upon. Interesting to read women authors concerning war when the general view is that women cannot write war literature. Wish we could have read all of &quot;Thin Red Line&quot;,</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: LITANDFILM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Lewis is awesome.  He is so enthusiastic about the classes he teaches, and he encourages his students to ask for help.  He is awesome.

Professor Lewis is such a well educated man, he welcomes different points of view, and introduced us to literature that is now on my list of favorite books. He's a funny down-to-earth guy.

ONE OF THE BEST professors at DePaul,I hope I get the chance to take another class w/ him!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2005<br>Class Name: AMS290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAzing guy! take him, please do yourself the favor! hes SO nice, so sweet, so so so very helpful and kind. full of amazing insight on the subject-keeps it juicy even tho it can be a dry topic.

The papers were a little difficult, but he was an easy grader.  HE is not very  lenient or helpful in special circumstances.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: AMS290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great guy, very passionate about the subject he teaches.

It was very straightforward and he did a great job with connecting all the material. He is intimidating at first but he is so wonderful. He is intelligent, encourages class participation and is funny. I love his stories about his life. Any class he teaches in the future I am there! One of the best professor at DePaul!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best english teacher I have had. He has really funny stories to tell in class as well as a good reading selection. He has certain little things he is anal about in papers, some would say that makes him a hard grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's super nice, but the work that has to be done was hard. We had to do our own in depth research. Difficult if you choose a hard topic. three papers and he seems like a hard grader. He even says he's very &quot;anal&quot; about certain things. Good class for an english major. Not for slackers/essay-haters.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2005<br>Class Name: ENGLISH103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this is the best english teacher i have ever had.  he had funny stories. readings were sorta centered on war. some was vietnam war. but its not boring to much. he explains everything u need to know though. i reccomend a lot!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the best teachers i've ever had!he is so nice and really wants his students to do well. take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>fair grader, intresting lectures, awesome guy, overall great class. he is very willing to help students with their papers and ideas. highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers I have ever had.
