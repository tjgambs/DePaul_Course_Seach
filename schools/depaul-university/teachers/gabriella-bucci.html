	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

When I say she's a tough grader I mean she will very easily give you a C or D even if you have done all the homework, attended every class, etc. I worked really hard only to get a B-</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2015<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Only downfall would be the large classes she teaches, she's enthusiastic but slightly impersonal. Her lectures are very clear and she has some fun demonstrative activities. I had no previous knowledge of economics before taking this course but she was a great person to introduce it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2015<br>Class Name: ECO314<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Gabriella is hands down the best professor I have had at DePaul.  Her classes are a challenge, but her enthusiasm for economics inspires you to work hard.  She is always willing to go out of her way to help as much as she can.  You must take one of her classes whether you are an econ major or not!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2015<br>Class Name: ECO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She packs every minute with information and works to make class interesting and relevant. One of the best professors at DePaul.

Some people find microeconomics hard but no matter what teacher you take it will be if you are one of those that struggle with new concepts. My suggestion: go to SI Sessions, it not only helped me pass, but I got an A in the class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2015<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great teacher very helpful and cares about teaching othes; however econ is a tough subject.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: 105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>She's seriously great.

Gives great examples and power point lectures. However, her midterms are long and more like final exams. She gives two quizzes, homework assignments every week and a midtermfinal. STUDYING is a must for this class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2014<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Bucci did a great job teaching all the basic concepts of Micro. But the mid-term and final are though so be sure to STUDY. She does offer extra credit by being present on days of experiments, which is nice. Overall, great class. And the textbook was a lifesaver. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Bucci is very energetic and passionate about micro. It really made being in class as enjoyable as possible. I would recommend her to anyone, but this class isn't easy. You will have to study difficult material. She was not the best at giving homework back, but posted the answer key every time. Lectures can be all over the place. Note taking is hard</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2014<br>Class Name: ECON314<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is a very enthusiastic and nice teacher.  Her lectures are rushed and the information is galore, but she is willing to help and organizes her information well.  The only problem I had was that the homework and notes are exponentially easier than the midterm and final.  She does not prepare you well for her tests and offers no reviews.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2014<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>I liked 106 much better than 105, but Bucci was pretty good. I have a good aptitude for Econ, my only complaint is that on the quizzes, the problems were a lot more complicated than what we went over in class. She's a clear teacher in what she wants, and she knows her stuff and has been teaching for a long time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2013<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best Econ teachers I have ever had. Took her summer class and am going to take her during the school year. Always available night or day and always willing to help students, cant ask for much more than that. Her lectures are organized and she is very intelligent.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2013<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bucci has been one of my favorite professors that I've taken. She's really fun and makes the material as interesting as possible. The material can get tough but she loves to help her students so utilize her office hours!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: ECON104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i always felt confident leaving class feeling like i understood everything but the homework ad quizzes rarely matched what we went over in class. very fast paced not worth buying the book either</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2012<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Eco 105, Bucci should not be your first choice..to young to honor her complex nature. Those in 305 and above hard work, enthusiasm, and a passion for learning are encouraged The key to a professional economist= the ability to draw graphs and quantify your findings; with the ability to xplain concepts, she teaches this</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: ECO314<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bucci is a teacher who is really enthusiastic about economics. I think she taught well only thing I have issue with was the homework. Sometimes it pertained to class other times it felt like busy work. Midterm and Final are tough so be prepared. To conclude, tough tests, great teacher, not impossible to get an A but you have to work for it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: ECC105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Proff Bucci explained everything clearly. Showed terrific examples, she took questions& allowed people to make comments during her lectures. midterm had some tricky questions but if u explained why you chose that answer to her after she gave them back you could get more points. I took this class b4 with another teacher, she was worlds different.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Economics teacher at DePaul.  I would not even still be an economics major if it wasn't for Prof Bucci.  Take her if you care about econ and want to learn.  NO MATH INVOLVED!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2010<br>Class Name: ECON305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All and all I would say that I'm not very happy with the class.  She is a very nice lady and encourages student participation.  On the down side, I don't think she teaches the material very well.  She goes very fast, sometimes to fast for herself, causing her to make a lot of mistakes during the lecture. Do the homework and you'll pass.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Got to use a sheet of notes on midterm, no reason to not get an A. Homework isnt even that bad. She is funny and very in tune with the class, not to mention a great teacher.  Will take her again if I have the chance.  Anyone who says she is &quot;too hard&quot; is a straight up coward.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: ECON305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice lady. Talks a mile a minute, the information is difficult and it goes quickly. Homework is graded and dont expect to get a perfect score. She never gives that out. Exams are tough, 30-40 MC and a good 5-8 questions that you need graphs and perfect explanations for. I took he bc I wanted to learn a lot. I dont learn as much as I hoped.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2009<br>Class Name: ECO314<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Among the most difficult teachers I had, but you learn so much.  Very hard grader, but she wants you to learn.  Show up to class, take excellent notes, ask questions, and review then you should get a B or C on exams.  Homework and assigned papers are arduous and graded hard, but make or break your grade, so do them.  Very helpful outside class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2008<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is good teacher, but moves through the concepts quickly.

She's good at explaining stuff, knows what she's talking about.  Don't do the online version of the book.

Very patient with questions. But she is a miser when it comes to giving points. Nobody get a perfect score.  Even when you do everything right on the homework she will still take off points just to see if your paying attention.  Tests are purposely impposible.  The only way to get an A is to see her during office hours</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2007<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof.  Gives great real life examples and her classes are really interesting.

BUT BUT the test is extremely hard, she grades hard, stingy on points, not consider student sucess, I read these rate before and give a try. I am so regret to take this class. Tried my best, but still end up with a D. The class average final exam score is 61%.

She explains the material well in class, but her midterms do not reflect her teachings.  She knows what she is talking about, but her midterms and final is complete different than what her discussions are.  She has no study guide and expects you to study every little detail in the book, even if it wont be on the test</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a good teacher, but you have to study on your own a lot.

I learned alot in the class and knew what I was doing however she gives weekly quizzes that are weighted and bring your grade down. I understood all the material and could teach the class by the end of the quarter but ended up getting a C. Take her to learn not to get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2005<br>Class Name: ECO310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned a ton of random econ theory from this course but really nothing concrete. I felt the lectures were interesting, full of content that needed study, and offered some general insight into her view of economics but did not offer me a economic toolkit to use for future classes...BTW: Bucci is great!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2005<br>Class Name: ECO398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken Bucci for two different Econ classes and she is an awesome teacher.  You will never be bored in her class and she is not difficult, she is interesting. Her tests are very straightforward, no tricks. She will bend over backwards to make sure that you undertsand the material.  She does not want to see any student do poorly.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't listen to the people talking trash, they do not care to learn and do not like to be challenged.

Attendance is mandatory if you want to score and A. She's a fair grader, open to argument, but her exams are challenging; they take a strong understanding of Econ and the ability to apply a conceptual understanding of class material to her random exam examples.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: ECO398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I’ve taken Bucci for three economics courses and have received an A in all of them. Frankly, she is one of the best professors at DePaul. However, she does not “inflate” grades like most professors; you must earn a good grade. So how do you earn a good grade&#63; Forget about the textbook. Instead, go to EVERY class and take DETAILED notes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2005<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DROP HER!!
