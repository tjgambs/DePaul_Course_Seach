The "lectures" never made any sense. Terrible professor, grades had no reasoning to them. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES! Final was based off of NOTHING we had learned in class. AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the worst class i have ever taken.  She is disorganized beyond belief and requires an essay due every class.  I learned some interesting things but didn't need her help.  So annoying and rude.  I would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2015<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Gives a LOT of busy work that is totally pointless and to be honest I'm not even sure she grades most of it. That being said, she is also unclear about assignments and expectations. She interrupts herself and other students quite often, and easily gets distracted.  Nevertheless, she's a smart lady and the class is easy, just have to get used to it</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2015<br>Class Name: FCH104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Johnston was one of the worst teachers I've ever had! Most of the class is computer based, and she can't even turn the thing on. She spends 50% of the class asking students how to use a computer and even made her husband come in every class to help. She's unclear about how she grades, was very unorganized and always late. STEER CLEAR!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2015<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: WD</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I have ever had. Do not take any of her classes </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>For Psychology of Fairy Tales, she doesnt lecture but relies on student presentations. She constantly interrupts students and even herself. She makes you write a page long response for every reading which can be up to 4 a night. Busy work. Very unclear about expectations and constantly changing them. Easy A, but so aggravating.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2012<br>Class Name: FCH104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Johnston is very unclear in regards to her expectations of the class. She is not very helpful and when you ask for help, she is very rude and overbearing. She often rambles on in class and goes off on tangents. If I could have taken this class with another professor, I would have. I would not take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Guillemette's class even though I saw the ratings. It was a class about Rousseau and I am not interested in philosophy, but she made it one of my most enjoyable courses at DePaul. She's an amazing person and knows so much about the subject. I recommend this class and teacher, and I think she is just misunderstood!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2012<br>Class Name: FCH397<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's not very focused in class, but she's very passionate about the subject. Tends to interrupt presentations, and we did a lot of reading aloud which seemed silly for a 300 level class. It was okay. Not terrible, but I wouldn't really recommend it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2011<br>Class Name: FCH106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does not teach. Expect to teach yourself the material or get help from someone else. Her idea of teaching is having students read photocopies and the book lessons aloud. If attendance wasn't mandatory I would have stayed in bed and slept through every class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not hard. There is a TON of busy work and lots of reading but she's a fairly easy grader. She makes students take &quot;minutes&quot; each class and print off 20 copies for everyone for the next class. Very stubborn teacher. Likes to argue. Makes up assignments. Easier to tolerate as the class went on but overall I do not recommend this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Basically she picks on individual students to regurgitate &quot;what they thought&quot; of the readings and belittles them. WAAAY too much work. More than all of my other classes combined! The midterm was easier than expected, but she is SO unclear about everything- what she wants in papers, what will be on tests, etc. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. She's crazy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2009<br>Class Name: FCH104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you want an easy grade go for it, if you actually want to learn french look elsewhere.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: ISP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I registered for psychology of fairy tales with high hopes. It turned out to be a very frustrating class.  Lots of reading and 2 or 3 response due per class.  The teacher is very ambiguous and extremely unclear.  She's very opinionated and stubborn.  Do not argue with her, you will not win.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLASS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2009<br>Class Name: FCH104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't expect to improve your knowledge of vocabulary or pronounciation. I think my French got worse this quarter. She barely spoke French in class, and class time was focused on reading out of the book. We rarely discussed vocab or grammar. If you have to take her, get ready to teach yourself everything. But she's very flexible on due dates.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>terrible professor, took her for psychology of fairy tales. she was very unclear in her expectations and only saw things through her tiny view of the world. very frustrating to express your own opinions or ideas.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>absolute worst teacher i have ever had!!! the assignments were extremely unclear and all she did during class was pick fights or preach.stay away for your own good!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: FCH104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Run.

She is very unclear in her teaching and is never prepared for class. She goes on tangents and always picks a fight with you. The class was psychology of fairy tales, and I learned very little about psychology. I would not suggest taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2007<br>Class Name: FCH342<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>u have a DEATH WISH if u decide to take 1 of her classes! her teaching = preaching. each class consists of student 'presentations' during which she will INTERRUPT, YELL, WAVE HER ARMS AROUND and HUMILIATE YOU. if u aren't an advanced French speaker DO NOT take her classes as she is a fast talker and doesn't annonciate well. this woman is a JOKE.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never ever again........... save yourselves...

Class time was wasted every single day on stupid presentations and reading a French play that had absolutley no significance. But if you get on her good side, you can pretty much get away with anything, she never expects you to turn stuff in on time</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2006<br>Class Name: YOGASUTRAS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: FCH342<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are willing to take the time to get to know her style, Mme J. is one of the best teachers of literary analysis at DePaul. She has a big brain and she knows her stuff, but she is also very old school. She wants you to prove what you have learned - not unreasonable - and she makes you defend your French - it is a French class after all!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: FCH342<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her idea of teaching is to hastily tell you a few vague things in the beginning, then have the rest of the quarter be nothing but student presentations all day every day with her just sitting there interrupting and humiliatingly critiquing them.
