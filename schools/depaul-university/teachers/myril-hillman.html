			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

Not even a B+. We had a group project, and we have no clue what our grade for that was. I studied really hard because I wanted an A, but apparently it doesn't matter.

Doesn't have clear directions on anything. Doesn't have a schedule so you rarely know when things are due She expects class participation but every time you say something she acts like she doesn't speak english Take someone else!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2014<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class.

Professor has no control of her class, and LOVES to hear herself talk. Don' buy the book, because she doesn't teach from it. You can pretty much come and go whenever you want to in this class. Midterm, final, and group presentation that you will have absolutely NO guidance on. Don't ask for a curve.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2012<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If there was another professor in DePaul who would teach this class, it would be best to pick them over Hillman. Powerpoint slides are a bit pointless since they come from the book anyway. Since she curves tests, she wants to make it so that students actually did well even though they didn't.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is horrible, top 3 worst I have had at DePaul.  Don't buy book, she doesn't teach from it.  Hell, she didn't even teach out of the book she told us to buy.  Going to class is pointless</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2011<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was pretty useless.

I got by with a B and that was still hard.  I had true interest in market research and learned nothing in this class.  All excel assignments that are shown on screen in class, not taught how to read them or what they mean. Avoid if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2010<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely not the most interesting class you'll take, but that has a lot to do with the subject matter... class is easy at least, grades are heavily padded. I took summer session class and our midterm and final were half easy multiple choice, half take home plug some numbers into excel & let it run some tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2010<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice person, but horrible professor. She assigns final project and gives you outline a week before. Her exams are right out of the book, but she can't teach to save her life.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly hated this class.  She is a very sweet lady, but the course is very dry and the project is not incorporated into class discussions.  It feels like she made slides of book chapters which is great for some, but I don't pay 2 grand/quarter to be lectured out of a book, I can read it for a lot cheaper. Class is very lackluster :(</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE! I would rather graduate late then ever take her again for another class. Worst professor at DePaul hands down. I ended up knowing less about statistics then when i came in. do yourself a favor and AVOID AT ALL COSTS!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the nicest professors I have had at DePaul! She has a ton of real-world marketing experience, so her lectures are always interesting and filled with stories.  The exams are not easy, but she is a leniant grader overall. She is in a wheelchair, so she has an assistant who comes to class and helps her out.  Overall great class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I missed 15 problems on the midterm and still got an A on it... an 80% is an A- in this class. Study for the tests from her slides, that is where she develops questions from. Class sessions are painful to sit through, but she is so easy at grading. Still work hard though because people still ended up with C's even with that grading scale some how!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2008<br>Class Name: MKT315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very helpful and nice.

Can't teach and thinks she's funny. But it will help if you suck up a little.
