			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

His class initially seems like a lot of work, but it isn't a lot. Skim the readings, read powerpoints. Two papers, a midterm, and final. Papers were clear-cut in criteria, and he gave us study guides. His feedback on the papers isn't too bad, but could be clearer. Easy class, and if you miss a few, it isn't too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2015<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Martin's lectures are long and can be dull, but he's is hilarious. There are only four grades: two papers, midterm, and a final. Grading is straight forward and not difficult if you follow the guidelines. He makes you buy the older version of the textbook to save money and it only cost me $4. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Professor Martin.

Lectures are long and boring so his cooky humor helps. He writes on a white board and his handwriting is really messy so sometimes it's hard to understand what he's saying, but overall it's pretty laid back</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: CMNS583<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love him! He is very entertaining, knowledgeable, helpful and makes the material easy to comprehend. This is my first graduate level research methods class and  he makes quantitative research fun and painless! I love his teaching style and he always brings back snacks (oreos) for the class after break. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: ORGC352<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him! For those of you who like Horan, Martin is an older version of him, but a whole lot cooky (weird but awesome). Coming to class isn't dreadful because he is SO hilarious and if you take notes you are golden on tests. This class only had a midterm and a final plus a 10 page paper on an interview.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS543<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really funny.

He's a great guy but his final tests you on the most random facts from movies and doesn't test whether or not you understand the concepts of small group communication.. there's only 4 grades in the class so his final screwed me over...not recommended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a little bit of a stutter so you'll find yourself writing the same things twice or more in your notebook haha.. He's so nice though and so sincere. He lets you out like 15 minutes early most of the time and doesn't usually start right at the beginning of class. He puts his notes up online at the end of the quarter too. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers.

He uses the chalkboard alot and draws alot of diagrams.  Take detailed lecture notes because he tests mostly on that.  He has a great sense of humor and is pretty helpful.

He was always covered in chalk from running into the board when I took his class.  Tells the best stories.  The best way to get an A in his class - actually go and take notes.  Then make a study group before exams.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2005<br>Class Name: CMN360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is incredible!! The class sucks, and he'll even admit that ahead of time and remind you of it several times throughout the course. There are only three grades (paper, midterm, final--all writing-based) and another 10% for attendance, but he gives you some of the essay questions beforehand. His stories are HILARIOUS; take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2005<br>Class Name: CMN360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don Martin is awesome!
