What I didn't like about it was his grading policy. Your grade is broke down into four parts: 25% essay 1 25% essay 2 25% midterm 25% final     so if you aren't good at taking tests DO NOT take this course</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2015<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Martin is  so funny! His class initially seems like a lot of work, but it isn't a lot. Skim the readings, read powerpoints. Two papers, a midterm, and final. Papers were clear-cut in criteria, and he gave us study guides. His feedback on the papers isn't too bad, but could be clearer. Easy class, and if you miss a few, it isn't too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2015<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Martin's lectures are long and can be dull, but he's is hilarious. There are only four grades: two papers, midterm, and a final. Grading is straight forward and not difficult if you follow the guidelines. He makes you buy the older version of the textbook to save money and it only cost me $4. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Professor Martin. He's so funny, kind, and genuinely cares about his students. Definitely reccomend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2012<br>Class Name: CMN356<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Martin is a hilarious pre-senial man- 2 tests, one paper.  Lectures are long and boring so his cooky humor helps. He writes on a white board and his handwriting is really messy so sometimes it's hard to understand what he's saying, but overall it's pretty laid back</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: CMNS583<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love him! He is very entertaining, knowledgeable, helpful and makes the material easy to comprehend. This is my first graduate level research methods class and  he makes quantitative research fun and painless! I love his teaching style and he always brings back snacks (oreos) for the class after break. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: ORGC352<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him! For those of you who like Horan, Martin is an older version of him, but a whole lot cooky (weird but awesome). Coming to class isn't dreadful because he is SO hilarious and if you take notes you are golden on tests. This class only had a midterm and a final plus a 10 page paper on an interview.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS543<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really funny.  Relatively easy workload.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His final is impossible.. He's a great guy but his final tests you on the most random facts from movies and doesn't test whether or not you understand the concepts of small group communication.. there's only 4 grades in the class so his final screwed me over...not recommended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a little bit of a stutter so you'll find yourself writing the same things twice or more in your notebook haha.. He's so nice though and so sincere. He lets you out like 15 minutes early most of the time and doesn't usually start right at the beginning of class. He puts his notes up online at the end of the quarter too. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers. He is funny and that's how his lectures are. Exams are not hard. He really made the class fun - strongly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVED Donald Martins class! he is a great teacher and sucha cute man! he tells funny stories that help you understand the material better. His tests are somewhat easy if you take notes and acually attend class. i would recommend him to anyone! hes great!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2008<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Martin was a wonderful teacher.  He kept the students engaged and also a very good sense of humor.  I suggest that you take his class if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>relatively small work load. very nice and very entertaining. notes everyday. 1 test 1 paper. gives helpful feedback, not the best review sheet. not the easiest class. would recommend</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2007<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seems like a nice guy, but oh man is he boring.  Add on to that the fact that he stutters A LOT, and you got yourself one unlistenable hour of bad material.  Luckily, you can get everything from class on blackboard. A guy I'd chat with than have teach me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2007<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>UHHH...Take his class...you are dumb if you don't. He is the coolest professor at DePaul.

He uses the chalkboard alot and draws alot of diagrams.  Take detailed lecture notes because he tests mostly on that.  He has a great sense of humor and is pretty helpful.  Takes you by surprise with the things he says.  His funny examples help you memorize the concepts.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2006<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i seriously enjoyed going to class. he has the BEST sense of humor.. hes not all full of himself like other profs.  he gives very clear notes and doesnt waste time on boring/pointless stuff. he needs to teach more classes!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2006<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probobly one of the funniest and most amuzing teachers here at DePaul.  I cannot possibly verbalize to you how funny this professor is and he is not anywhere close to what the other rater before me said.  Take him! It will be the funniest hour-hour or hour & a half of you life.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2006<br>Class Name: COMMM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guys psycho...but stay in his class and youll be okay ...he is picky on little details you will never imagine in your loves...but also watch your grades...keep all your scores..cuz this guy will screw ur grade & change it around cuz he is dumbas they come..he'll judge you on body language and eye contaqct..this guys a loon..take another teach</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very cute man! He is soo funny sometimes. He's always bumping into stuff but he doesn't care.  He also repeats things 10 tens while he's talking so it'll be good for you when you write your notes, and let me tell you, you'll need them!!  His exams are blue book exams and they are not easy but he's fair.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Napoleon complex just a bit a severe case of ego mania as well. Pays way too much attention to pointless little details, grades on body language.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2005<br>Class Name: COMMMETHODS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, very accessible.  He was always covered in chalk from running into the board when I took his class.  Tells the best stories.  The best way to get an A in his class - actually go and take notes.  Then make a study group before exams.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2005<br>Class Name: CMN360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is incredible!! The class sucks, and he'll even admit that ahead of time and remind you of it several times throughout the course. There are only three grades (paper, midterm, final--all writing-based) and another 10% for attendance, but he gives you some of the essay questions beforehand. His stories are HILARIOUS; take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2005<br>Class Name: CMN360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don Martin is awesome! He is so funny and he gives good examples so that you can understand. As long as you get all the notes from class you will be fine. Don Martin rocks!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2005<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, TOO many notes, gives u some of the questions to final and midterm, really nice and goofy guy but u have to go to class cuz there are TONS of notes and believe me U WILL NEED THEM ALL for the exams!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: CMN360315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best teachers I have had.
