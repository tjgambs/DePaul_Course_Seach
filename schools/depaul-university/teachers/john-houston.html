	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

Not helpful, not inspiring, not a good teacher.  Distills fear in his students so they don't bother him. Teaches and leaves, office hours are not there for you, directs you straight to the tutors. No EC, no curve. Don't do it...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2012<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bad professor. Rude to students. Disrespectful. Many students had to drop out. Professor did not care about you, just wanted to teach and get out. Try another.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2012<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Houston's writing is impossible to deceipher as well as his teaching style. He enjoys singling out students and does not let up, even if you tell him you don't have the right answer. 1st half class is reviewing the homework problems, 2nd half is new material and assignement of homework. Most people dropped. Too stressful of a class to prepare 4</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2012<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor did not teach the material very well. He will call you out in class and if you are lost or confused it is your fault. This professor's teaching style did not help me learn the material. He was not very accommodating. I would recommend taking another professor. His class is too stressful. Most students dropped.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to learn a lot about corporate finance and did well in FIN 310, take Dr. Houston. I thought he was an excellent professor and as long as you are willing to do the weekly homework, you will learn more than most other finance courses and also do well in the 2 exams. One of my favorite DePaul professors!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Houston is a very good professor. However, you must be willing to do the work and be prepared for his class. You do work hard but will remember the material. His final is exactly like the homework. Not bad at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very good but an extremely tough professor and demands that you put lots of work in the class. If you are a finance major and you are serious about learning, take him, but expect to be challenged. He says he expects 9 hours a week, I put in maybe 2 and received an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I normally don't leave comments.

He doesn't explain anything, but expects you to know everything. I passed the class with a B only because I studied my a$$ off. You'd better understand your FIN 310 very well, if you want to take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is among the WORST professors at DePaul. Have fun trying to teach yourself, since he does not know how to teach. He should just retire, since he is too old to be learning how to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is difficult and the teacher is hard to understand, however it is NOT impossible! Very often you will be teaching yourself, it is true that he has the worst handwriting in the world, sit in front and pay close attention.Don?t give up, otherwise you will fail. Tests are straight forward from the HW. 2 tests, 2 QZ's and HW. Participate!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2010<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay FAR FAR Away. Professor never used book, just these 1920s handouts. He writes so light and small on the board, make sure you sit right up front. Never  explained things, expected you to know things. I am repeating the class over. STAY AWAY!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2009<br>Class Name: FIN201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are seriously trying to learn concepts in Finance either for your career or for post-grad work then take him. If you are only looking to get a passing grade, find someone easier. He will hold you accountable with participation, homework and tests but I guarantee you'll learn the concepts by heart.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2009<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although Professor Huston is rigid and tough you will learn a lot from his class. All the problems on his tests are taken from the homework. If you are lazy you will fail and it will be your fault. DePaul would be a much better place if more Professors were like Huston instead of power point reading drones.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2009<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor.

He encourages you to participate so you'll actually understand the material. He'll come off as a jerk at first, but he really wants you to learn.

Other than that, just midterm, final, 2 quizzes.  Do HW prob's & read the chapt's to do well on exams...not unlike other classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2008<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Houston is the wrost professor ever.

You will learn a lot in his class. Yes it is hard but isn't that what college is about; challenges. It will only help you in the future.

If you don't have a solid 310 foundation, you might find yourself confused. You have to read the assigned chapter carefully before coming to the lecture, otherwise your notes are useless. I have learned a lot from him, and he does have a wicked sense of humor, but you'll get it only if you're not Houston-hater</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DISCLAIMER- Like he says dont take him if you cant dedicate time to do the homework. HOWEVER, can learn same stuff with any other 311 PR and will be way EASIER. I withdrew and am taking another Pr and have learned a lot more because he takes the time to simplify the concepts. Houston uses intimidation to teach- and picks on you for the right answer</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2008<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Houston is one of the greats at DePaul. You will work very hard in this class, but it will pay off in the long run. I learned so much that will help me eventually land a job. Houston is clear and precise with his requirements for the course and you must adhere to them. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in corp finance</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2007<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a definate weed out class. Yes he is hard, but I agree with everyone, it's cause he cares.

He is NOT mean, he is nice.. he comes off rough but he truly cares about the students because he wants us to learn.  If u go to class, understand the homework. u should easily get a B.

He does his share of weeding out fin majors who should not be better off with some other major. I got asked some of the stuff he talks about on  the interviews. Know all the problems he assigns,go to class and READ the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2007<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The BEST professor at DePaul.  If you take him and take him seriously, you will do well. I do feel he is a little uptight, but rather funny at times. It's really funny when he picks on students who show up late or don't know their material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He can be rough on students, but he expects u 2 work hard for ur grade (we r paying lots of $$).

Starts class off by predicting the ways that you will fail.  Treats studentsllower than subordinates.  The only students that like him are the ones who are just as cocky...till they recieve their grade.  Intimidates students to lose their confidence.  Even disrespecful to older students.

You can't miss one class or you will probably fail. There's alot of homework that you HAVE to do cause he calls on everyone. I must admit that if I didn't have a friend who helped me alot, i don't know what i would have done.  But overall he's a realy nice man.

With that being said, Houston may be challenging but the grade you get at the end is one you work hard for.  You will have learnt a thing or two when you leave his class.

I know there is a lot of mixed comments posted about Houston and I will clear them all up.  FIN 311 is a tough class... he says you need 9 hours/week, but I got by with 30-35 hours in the quarter. YOU MUST SHOW UP TO CLASS, HW IS MANDATORY.  The guy isn't a dumbass, he knows what he is talking about.

I would take Lim anyday over him.  He is not helpful.  Midterm, final, and two quizzes.  Homework everyday... notes are your bible.

He is by no means an easy A.   In fact i barely got a B+ in his class.  But if you want an easy A don't take him.   If you want to learn a great deal of useful information and don't mind studying a lot well then he's for you.

You learn a lot from his class although the way he talks makes you think you're in the 1950's.  I enjoyed the class.  Attendance is mandatory and you'll get a deduction no matter what though.
