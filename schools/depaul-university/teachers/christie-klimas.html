Although teaching style quite mundane the subject matter behind the class resonated very well throughout the entire semester and abroad.  Would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: ENV250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Klimas is the best. She has such a dry, great sense of humor that reminds me of typical 'The Office' characters. If you're passionate about Economics or the Environment, don't mind reading, and can actually pay attention in class; then she is the perfect professor for you. Dr. Klimas is very helpful outside of class and wants you to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her for a focal point fair trade class. It was very unorganized and seemed like we talked about the same thing every class yet she gave a ton of work. There was a reading and summary due every week, 3 papers, a debate, and a presentation. We had to write research papers and it was impossible to find sources or any information. Don't take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2013<br>Class Name: ENV152ENV250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easily one of the best teachers I've had in my life. Material is organized and presented clearly. She's approachable, intelligent and good about answering student questions. Great dry sense of humor. Pulls most test questions straight from study guide. Material is hard at times, but she truly wants students to succeed. TAKE HER CLASSES!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2011<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very sweet, but VERY VERY boring. She's a push over when it comes to turning things in late, etc. This class was a ton of work. Chapter questions due every week. You would think an environmental class would be easy, but she gets into chemistry and assumes you already know things... no fun. Overall, she's really nice and funny  but it's a lot of wor</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
