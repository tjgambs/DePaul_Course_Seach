Teaches things that pertain to philosophy but does not encourage free thinking. Basically agree exactly on his views or you will not get a good grade. If you are willing to brown nose and BS go ahead. If you tend to question views politically take it with someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2015<br>Class Name: 100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. If you've never taken a philosophy class, take him for intro. Goes thoroughly through all the readings, you don't even really have to read outside of class. Such an easy grader and super helpful outside of class too. As long as you pay attention you should get an A. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2014<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof. Grade is two short papers & for each class turn in two questions about the short readings. He's not a "tough grader". He just hits lazy students hard on grammar and syntax. I wrote the papers the day before they were due and got an A . He also gave us extra credit just for watching a movie and an extension on the final. I Recommend, A+.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2014<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TONS of reading and you NEED to do it all. Reading is boring and long but lectures are very interesting. Neal is super smart and loves new ideas and discussions. You will learn a lot from him but you will not pass the class unless you do the readings and study hard for tests. Overall, awesome course but not a super easy A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2014<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Neal is cool. He is not the most formal teacher yet still goes into some very heavy detail. If you enjoy philosophy and take his course you will enjoy him. If you meet with him outside of class he will walk you through everything VERY VERY well. As long as you make the effort (like the damn student you are) you will take a lot back from the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He lectures through the whole class. He basically gives you all the information in the readings, so the reading is not mandatory. He grades really hard. Even though he gave a study guide a lot of the stuff that appeared on the midterm was not there, also he looks for very specific answers on the essays. He seems like he's trying to improve.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very knowledgable about philosophy but the class basically depended on how well you could regurgitate information, not necessarily having a strong understanding of the topic. Although it may not be his fault because it was an introductory course. He is sort of intimidating but very willing to help if you need it. The class is mostly lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2013<br>Class Name: PHL234<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class sounded interesting in the beginning, but after taking it with Dr. Miller he completely ruined it for me. All he did was lecture for the entire 90 minutes. His views are very one sided and he offers no alternative point. Avoid him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2013<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Neal is a cool guy, very friendly and outgoing, and willing to take the time to talk to yo. However, the assistance he provides is rather moot, as he is very hard to follow/unclear at times. The class is basically all lectures, with lot's of readings that are complex and dry. I always found it difficult to complete them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super cool guy. Attractive and interesting. Not the best teacher though, makes things more complex instead of simplifying. Boring lectures but interesting discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2012<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Average teacher. He knows what hes talking about and uses modern examples/makes jokes to keep the mood light. But he often just lectures and its hard to pay attention/keep up with him. There are so many readings its overwhelming and I never felt like I understood it before moving onto the next reading. Participation & reading required. Three Papers</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very dull and pointless experience. Got a good grade, but he is not a very good teacher. Just lectures most of the time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible class (unless you LOVE philosophy).  Miller drones on and on lecturing for all 3 hours of the class.  Never asks questions.  Incredibly boring and useless.  Miller is detached from reality</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2011<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are taking this class to fill the business ethics requirement, take another prof. This had absolutely NOTHING to do with business or ethics. Purely philosophy. Nice guy, but boring and confusing classs.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sometimes he had a little bit of trouble explaining what he what he was thinking but for the most part was very clear. As long as I went to class I understood the readings. The problem was less him and more me not understanding philosophy. I would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was an overall good teacher, a lot of reading but thats to be expected. No midterm, no homework (except the journal entries), and one final paper.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's young and tries his best to teach well. sometimes it's difficult to understand what he's saying when translating from the book or using greek words. Didn't try on the paper and i got an a-. e will ask you to do journals and notes based on the readings thats the only assignment other than the final paper!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, young and fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just do the reading and you'll be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was boring, now I am not.

We had weekly quizzes and a group project, that was all it consisted of. The team project was relatively easy and his readings are easy because he provides notes for each reading. Definitely an EASY CLASS</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2009<br>Class Name: BUSETHI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Neil is awesome.

He never really made anything clear. He is a tough grader and most of the time his grading makes no sense. He is a huge hipster who thinks he is the next descartes. I showed up to every class and took extensive notes. Don't take this class if you snooze off a lot. It is very boring!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the class is so boring it puts me to tears....nice teacher but man does that class dragggg onnnn. lots of reading as expected 4 small 1-2pg reading responces. midterm 3-4pg paper. final 5-6 pg paper.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome prof.

He kept it to a strict lecture process where he reviewed what we talked about before and then continued speaking at us for most of the time. It was difficult to understand him if you weren't focused, but he was easy to ask to explain certain things. Take notes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Required about five books to be purchased for class... went very fast and used difficult vocabulary... hard grader.. not that many grades for the quarter... talked the entire period with no break...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is boring but easy. If you pay attention and take good notes you'll do ok. He's very helpful to his students and understands that a student can just not understand the material.
