But the key to his class is listening and absorbing his feedback. He will help you if you ask and even when you don't. He is committed to improving the program and his students. But you as his student need to take the initiative to helping him out as well. Its a give and take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2013<br>Class Name: GAM394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never seen a professor so committed to helping his students succeed both inside of class and out. Taking his class will not only teach you how to make great, innovative games but also connect you with the Chicago Game Development community. Classes have no pointless work and are project based.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2013<br>Class Name: GAM397<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brian is probably one of the most interesting professors I've had at DePaul. His quirky antics always keep the class lively, and he will definitely challenge the way you think about games every step of the way. Definitely need to take at least one class by him, preferably art games.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2013<br>Class Name: GAM932<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Brian is a very helpful professor.  If you ask him for help, he is willing to provide it to you.  He is always available to discuss a problem, no matter if it is about a team mate, or a problem with your game.  His feedback on your game is all over the place, but if you really listen, you can learn a lot and make a great game for your capstone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2013<br>Class Name: GAM394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's teachers like Brian that keep the DePaul game development program alive and moving forward. His unconditional dedication to helping students succeed is unlike any professor I've had in my entire time at DePaul. I couldn't have asked for a better professor to guide us through our senior capstone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2013<br>Class Name: GAM395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Wants you to succeed. Asks a lot of you but it is all for your best interest. Makes a great effort to get to know his students and tries to make sure everyone on the teams voice is heard. Easy to get into contact with at anytime. Loved his class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: GAM392<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice guy. He just doesn't really know what he's doing teaching the class. On the plus side that makes it easy on grading because he doesn't know what's quality and whats not as well. It was a fun class, if you're self directed and know how to learn on your own then go it's well worth taking. Otherwise if you need help a lot stay clear</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
