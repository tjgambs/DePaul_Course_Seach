Great prof. Really fun class. Professor McIninch knows what she's doing. I learned a ton from her in class and her comments on papers. U need to do the readings.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mcininch is the best teacher I've had a DePaul.  You have to do the reading because she calls on students but I liked the essays and stories.  I wish I had her for 103.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was probably one of the worst teachers I've had at DePaul. She doesn't care about her students and I felt like the class was a waste of money. I learned absolutely nothing from her. She treats her students like children but she gets meaner and meaner as the quarter goes on. She should be a kindergarten teacher not a college professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She almost didn't care if we did the work.  Easy grader, very simple class. I would suggest her, not difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, not a bad class. 2 papers, one annotated bib. Research paper and reflective essay towards the end. Make sure you do the readings because she does give pop quizzes, which are pretty easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Erica is great. I would definately suggest taking her class!  She's really helpful one on one especially if you need help coming up with a paper topic.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>How does this professor not have any bad ratings yet&#63; This class has nothing to do with what anyone else is doing in WRD 104. She gives you a subject area for your research paper rather than letting you choose... You don't even start talking about research papers until the last three weeks. And she uses &quot;um&quot; like a comma, even when reading something!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>3-4 papers, there is a lot of reading to to she makes you print out most of them (which can go from 10 to 25 pages) but she is very helpful. The final is a research project, a portfolio on a person or a place. Its kind of a lot of work</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a really good prof. You actually have to do the readings because she'll throw in a quiz here or there. Very nice and helpful. Gave plenty of time to write the papers. She does expect quality work. After having a difficult experience on WRD 104, I missed Erica's class. I would recommend her and take another class with her again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed Erica's class. Like all WRD classes, attendance is mandatory. Do the required small reading, the quizzes are a piece of cake. Reasonable grader on papers,she allows for a lot of peer review in class which is helpful. After having a bad experience in WRD 104, I couldn't recommend Erica enough! Take her class, you'll like it!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
