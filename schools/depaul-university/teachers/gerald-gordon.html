			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

The assignments don't matchup with the class and book materials. He likes to throw curve balls on the exams. Overall however, he's a fair professor who wants his students to sweat.

You will end up more confused about programming than you ever were.  Only take him if you know programming already.  It is very difficult to understand him during class.  Lectures are confusing.  Assignments make absolutely no sense.  If you have the opportunity to take another professor, do so because you will learn more.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2007<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worse teacher ever.

But the midterm and final, is too long and not really based on the hw and what we had learned. it is hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2005<br>Class Name: CSC321<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is as outdated as his suits are. Just as everyone said, he is fast and unclear. Most of your work will be challenging and lengthy. He offers little assistance with questions, often leaving you more confused than you were before. If you can avoid him try to otherwise just try to get by.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm sure that Professor Gordon knows C++ very well, but he has trouble teaching it.  Really, the only way to get through this class is to already know C++ or to be willing to learn on your own.  He does know a lot about the history of computers though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2004<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gordon is a really good man. Sometimes he's unclear because he's a genius and knows way too much information. If you don't have any backround experience in C++, don't take this class because he moves very fast. Overall, he's a good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2004<br>Class Name: CSC210<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expected you to know a lot for an introductory course.
