This is a huge problem.  He will ask for a â€œsummary&quot;, and will then deduct from your final grade if you fail to provide an extensive discussion of subject of the assignment.  His classes often involve a lot of number crunching on excel.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: PSC282<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: PSC282<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doug is a nice guy, but the course is front-loaded with a lot of relatively pointless work. After the midterm, he absolutely eases up, but he's got a very superior air about him.
