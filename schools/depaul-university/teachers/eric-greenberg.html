	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

His exams are all CPA questions.  HW is 10% of grade, the rest is exams.  He is a great prof, and tells you the truth all the time.  He gives tons of useful info on a variety of topics.  Nice curve too!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome! His lectures are interesting, and he doesn't take it bad if you don't laugh about his lame jokes. He is extremely fair when it comes to grading, but if you are an accounting major then you definitely have to put in the extra effort and work through the book parallel to attending the class. I look forward to see him in ACC 360.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accounting sucks, but he made it tolerable. Lots of lame jokes, but he is very detailed. Goes over the assignments very thoroughly and is available outside of class as much as is needed. Quantity of work wasn't too bad, and he curves to where at least half the class gets an A or a B. Didn't take attendance either. I'd definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my first day today, and this has been the first teacher at DePaul so far that has kept my attention the whole class.
