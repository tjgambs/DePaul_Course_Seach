I'm now a senior, Economics major with a 3.8 GPA. I got a B in this class but worked super hard. These other comments are accurate. Tests are convoluted MC based solely on his lecture, a method of teaching that should not be used for Econ. If you like the subject and care about grades, do not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All that counts for his class are the midterm and final. His exams had nothing to do with the the readings in the book, they were supposedly based off his notes but you cant understand any of his notes b/c he mumbles.Attendance is mandatory, and he wants everyone to be on time but he is always late.DO NOT waste your time or money taking this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wiltgen lectured from a stack of notes in his textbook but rarely looked at them. Besides not providing any help on sample problems for the exams, the grade for the class was based soley on  midterm & final. Both contained 80-90 questions with essays. Not only were they long, the questions consisted of 5 confusing choices each. I studied for 30+ hours the week of the final and midterm. Ended up with a C- in the class. Worst college class taken to date. At least I passed</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2011<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I have ever had.

The problem is that his test don't match what he teaches - meaning he gets his multiple choice question from a book. There 80 on the midterm (40%). and the final is  60%.
