			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

He is a horrible teacher. He gets easily frustrated when you ask him a question or to take a moment to clarify. I seriously learned more from the college student math tutors than him. He makes you pay almost $110 for the online HW access code plus the really expensive depaul book ($100-180).

Without prepared lecture notes, this produces many algebra mistakes. Doing the homework doesn't help for his exams. They consist of material that hasn't been covered since basic algebra, like  (x-y)^3(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2), only you will have to integrate this.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His accent is hard to understand, he is a nice guy but cannot teach math to someone who doesn't know math very well.

Definitely a teacher for higher thinkers. I felt bad for the kids that weren't good at math, though. If you are good at math, take him. I got a 100% in the class and didn't do an ounce of homework.

He comes off as a nice guy at first, joking and letting you out of class early. He dodges questions with rude comments. You insult him if you don't know something.

Class was never mandatory, he always let you leave early, and there was never any homework.
