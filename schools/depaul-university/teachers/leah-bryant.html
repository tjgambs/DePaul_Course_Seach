	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

She spends more time ranting about her cats than actually telling you what you need to know. Our midterm, which was supposed to be super easy, was very hard.

That being said, her expectations aren't really laid out.  She claimed that the final was going to be &quot;a piece of cake&quot; when in reality it wasn't.

She is so intelligent and her lectures truly reflect that fact.  I looked forward to going to class everytime because I knew I would leave with new knowledge.

I was 20 minutes late for a 9:40am midterm and she wouldn't let me take it because one student had finished and left (2 MINUTES BEFORE). She said the test was 'unsecured'.

Absolutely amazing! You leave class in a good mood. For her half of the quarter you have an analysis and an exam.
