	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

It is a 100 level class yet he treats it like it's 300 level. If you want to pass the tests, read everything about the topic i.e. notes, books, even online resources and even then, it is still an extremely difficult class. He is also incedibly dry and an unfair grader. Do not take as an SI elective!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2011<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ridiculously boring. I drank redbull before every class and still managed to fall asleep. He is a harsh grader. This is not a matter of studying or not, I studied, I read the book and followed the study guides. Be sure to pay attention to diagrams and publications of astronomers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the most BORING man on the planet.  I had to pull off my eyelashes just to make sure I was still alive in his class.  His grading is very hard, however the extra credit saved me. Two quizzes, two finals.  Memorize EVERYTHING in the book, his lectures, wikipedia and do both extra credit assignments you might just come out with an A.. maybe.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: PHY101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor!

He really knows his stuff and his grading policy is fair. All people have to do in his class is study the study guide and take notes, and you'll do fine. I don't know why some people put such bad reviews about him, they probably never studied. I learned alot more than I thought I would.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2009<br>Class Name: PHY204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>* he looks like Gimli the dwarf from lord of the rings. He is the most boring teacher on the planet, he makes an interesting subject unbearable. There is an art to teaching, he does not possess it. There is a stark difference in knowing and being able to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2009<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class. Cool topic. He gives you extra credit like it is candy. Just go to the planetary movie thing. You get a discount with a can of pepsi.

He's very smart, but he's not a very good presenter of what he's saying, strays from the point a lot, but has easy tests. Frankly though, this is the norm of what you'll find as far as science instructors go.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To get a A in his class you really have to know EVERYTHING he teaches. Fortunately, its a cool topic so its not hard to study. Lots of extra credit - go to the planetarium (and check the website for free days- they have them all the time).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2009<br>Class Name: AST204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIM! I have never done so bad in a class. He is confusing and thinks he is better than you! STAY AWAY!

He's quite intelligent but is not a great teacher. Get a different teacher if you're taking astronomy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was so easy. Two quizzes, a midterm, and a NONCUMULATIVE final. If you write a five page term paper you can get 20 extra credit points, and more are offered by going to the planetarium. He gives you study guides & has reviews. Not hard to get an A at all. Lectures are boring though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Corso is a knowledgeable professor, you just have to get used to his teaching style. The class is easy enough to get through if you read, take notes, and study the diagrams because you will have to draw and discuss them. He offers up to 30 pts extra credit. You can definitely take advantage of that if you screw up on one of his exams.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow.. Just took the final. my A has now dropped to a low B/C+ unless he curves this damn thing. Unnecessarily difficult final exam on material he barely discussed and not clearly stated in the book. What a damn shame. *sigh*</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: PHY100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The mean comments below are just plain ignorant. His intro astronomy class is so easy IF you study EXACTLY what he tells you to study (study guide). For the essay portion of his exams: Just write down *verbatim* everything he says about the characteristics of the models on the syllabus. Yes, class is a bit boring, but you must go. This is college.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2008<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Corso is a highly intelligent professor that obviously is interested in the subject matter he teaches.  He explains, clearly, exactly what he puts on the exams and his grading policy is fair. The people who didn't like him probably shouldn't be in college in the first place as they likely see college as purely an outlet to consume alcohol.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2008<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class Structure: 300 Points Total. Final = 100 points, Midterm  = 100 points, Quiz 1 = 50 points, Quiz 2 = 50 Points. 30 points of possible extra credit.

Fill up the entire tests with writing ( he will give you an A, I rambled about politics on the back page and he didn't even bother reading it and gave me an A on the midterm).  Very pompous thinks he is so much better then you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: PHY204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY from this guy, he wears the same cloths every lecture, (does he shower, have a change of cloths&#63;)  Made a very interesting topic horrible.  Does not know what a computer is, literally.  Still uses projections and his tests and syllabus is hand written and it looks like it has been copied over the years to the point that it is not legible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: PHY204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows his outer space but he's pretty boring.  It'd be hard to deal with his monotone if you're not interested in it on your own.  But if you like light waves and black holes and pulsars, go for it!  It was super interesting, and his tests are simple enough - just memorize and repeat.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2007<br>Class Name: PHY101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was boring but as long as you study for the test you will do fine.
