Even if you hate the class or subject, Swain will engage your interest.  He's hilarious and makes sure his students are able to relate class content to the real world.  Extremely helpful, not a single mean bone at all, laid back, and makes you work for a good grade.  Would have him again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really chill laidback guy who has some corny humor but hes really passionate about what he teaches and keeps everything interesting and relevant. He assigns 3 essays and a few reading assignments and is really clear-cut about what he expects so in all honestly as long as you stay on top of those, you'll have a great experience. Take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Swain is AMAZING!!!

The three essay's you have to do are fairly simple in nature. Readings are also interesting and short! Fairly easy grader and lenient with due dates if need be.Pretty laid-back with his teaching style and has a geeky sense of humor...making this mandatory class a bit more tolerable.Definitely recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and person overall.

He's a corny funny guy. Our class was based on social media and he made the connections work. He worked w me in regards to late assignments or redoing work. He was very lax with grades. He made it a point to know names and faces. I have taken WRD 104 3 times and he was the BEST professor EVER.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is interesting and super funny!
