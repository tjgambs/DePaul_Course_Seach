He makes learning Chinese fun and easy. However, since the class is pretty easy if you want to learn you have to do a lot of outside studying. Other than that, he's great!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2009<br>Class Name: CHN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very kind professor and he emphasized a lot on character pronunciation & writing. However, sometimes class was a bit too easy and then could get boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2008<br>Class Name: CHN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Xu laoshi is perhaps THE best professor at DePaul University. We love him! Anyone who says anything bad about him is an ignorant, insidious, repugnant, nefarious, contempuous moron and we will tar and feather you in a public square!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2008<br>Class Name: CHN103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>How can you not love this man&#63; Chn is a hard language to pick up, so you're not going to able to sleep thru this class, but he explains it extremely well. Just study and put some effort into it, and you'll do fine. Not too hard to get an A grade. Great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: CHN104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was funny and nice, but I dont think he teaches that well...in my class, he stuck WAY too much to the textbook and the grammer usage and doesn't apply it to what you'd actually use in real life while speaking the language...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2007<br>Class Name: CHN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Xu is awesome definately great teacher. He's so funny but you have to work hard and keep up with the class. He's not that open to helping outside of class, but still a good teacher. He's very randomly funny and a nice person in general.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2006<br>Class Name: CHN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! The class is not the easiest, but he makes things a lot better than I expected. Really couldn't ask for much more, he helps however he can, and is very nice and understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2006<br>Class Name: CHN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an easy teacher. Mostly gives A's or B's. He makes sure students understand the material well before moving on to the next chapter. Show up to class and you'll get a good grade</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: CHN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Xu knows that Chinese is difficult for English speakers. He teaches at a slow pace, but it is so you are FLUENT. If you show up everyday, you will be fluent in written and spoken language.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: CHN101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Xu is a really nice guy, so that makes it hard to write this, but I'm gonna write it: he either doesn't know how to teach or doesn't care. Seriously, I am surprised the University allows a class like this to exist: NO quizzes, NO homework. If you want an easy A, this is for you. If you want to learn, stay away.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
