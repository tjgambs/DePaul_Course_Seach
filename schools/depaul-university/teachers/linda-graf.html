Her class is very interesting and informative and she is very helpful!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2013<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Thumbs down</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2013<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Many of the exam questions have multiple correct answers yet she asks you to know the "most" correct one which makes it very difficult. I am an all A student and she is making this class impossible. The structure is terrible with no clarity on how to be successful in this class. I emailed her and asked for help and she responded rudely.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2012<br>Class Name: NSG440<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not helpful</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2012<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quite a very bad experience. I will avoid her class in the future.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2012<br>Class Name: NSG332<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was not always taught by Prof Graf. I don't it is fair to put the entire blame on her. The department is going to have a new instructor starting this Fall. Hopefully, she will make the necessary changes from prior complaints. I would like to recommend that they stick with the online resource, study guide, and tx book for quizzes and exam</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows what she's talking about but her tests are pretty hard. The average of our final exam was a 69.9, which, to me, means there's something wrong with it. There is only a midterm and a final, and there are no assignments due in lecture. All the assignments and grading are left up to the lab instructors, so assignments aren't graded too hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2012<br>Class Name: NSG332<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's nice to see the changes they've made. I hope they don't recline to the events that led to some students'lost of interest in the  class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2012<br>Class Name: NSG332<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Within the past few weeks, Linda Graf and her group have made tremendous efforts to change the outlook of this course. The questions don't seem abstract and vague anymore, I might end up with A or A- in her class this quarter. I will take her class again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2012<br>Class Name: NSG332<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Can be sometimes rude to students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2012<br>Class Name: NUR332<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This instructor doesn't seems to have the best interest of the students at heart. She is non-responsive to the students' complaints. Her weekly quizzes, most of the time, do not come from her lecture materials. She can turn things around by making some adjustments to the way she set her questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2012<br>Class Name: NSG332<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The major problem I see with this class is that the textbook, evolve website, and powerpoint presentation weren't helpful to most students. Most of the questions were simply "applied" questions which tend to deviate from the actual classroom lectures. The instructor should create a sense of teacher/students connection. She is ok but can do better.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2011<br>Class Name: NSG485<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Linda Graf does NOT possess many of the basic qualities that a professor should.  She has given us blatantly incorrect information in class and was actually argumentative with a student who tried to point out her inaccuracies.  Not only our her lectures full of misinformation, they are no where near congruent with the information we are tested on.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Linda has no idea how to teach or give knowledge to students effectively. She will lecture in the most boring manner, often skipping slides claiming &quot;we should know that already&quot; or &quot;you can look that up on your own.&quot; Then when the midterm and the cumulative final come around she lies about that is and what isn't on them. Such a waste of a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2010<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>had her for lectures, where she just read off the ppts. but i mean cmon, theres a lot of info to give and what do people expect, for her not to go through a ppt&#63; she lets you ask questions during class, which is really interesting. mini pop quizzes for attendance. she def knows what she is talking about!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: NSG332<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor has no business teaching this course. Her lectures were pointless since she reads off powerpoint slides which were constructed by the manufacturer of the book. She is dishonest. She'd say something is on the exam and it's not; or, she'd say something is not on the exam, and it is. Avoid if you can. Otherwise, good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, she is not a bad person. However, she makes the class much harder than it should be.2 quizzes, outline, research paper, midterm,final(100 questions)(comprehensive),weekly assignments (lengthy), individual presentation, mandatory attendance,pop-up quizzes, tons of reading and memorization.omg,we are not nursing students!it's a science class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2010<br>Class Name: N332<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class should be online.  We get nothing out of coming to lecture.  This isn't really her area of expertise, in her defense, but we aren't learning anything from her.  Every exam question comes directly from the book.  This would be OK with me if she knew the answers to the questions herself.  I think 1/3 of the class is failing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2010<br>Class Name: NURS332<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Linda is a very nice lady overall, however she lies.  She says something will not be on the test, and then it is. She is very smart when it comes to pregnancy and OB stuff, but that is not what this class was about and she didn't know a whole lot about the rest of the topics covered.  All she did was read the slides off. I can do that at home.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never negatively reviewed a professor before, but Linda Graf, teaching a  health class, lives in an extremely heteronormative world. This class doesn't respect differences in women and is painfully, horribly boring. No lecture was interesting. She can drag 5 slides out for two hours. Just terrible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2009<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seems well intentioned and is by no means a bad professor, but her lectures are painfully boring and she should honestly not be allowed to write her own exams, even if you know the material the questions are really unclear.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great science lab requirement class for non-science majors! One of the only classes I've taken where the material you learn will actually be really useful later in life. A lot of work, and not an easy A, but as long as you show up to class and follow directions really carefully for tests and HW, this is a great class to take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was wonderful and nice for a non-science kind of person.  I like Linda a lot; she really knows her stuff and wants you to learn as much as possible.  The labs started out pointless, but became much more interactive as time went on.  Go to lecture!  You will get lots of extra credit.  Overall, awesome class, nice and knowledgeable teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2007<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice enough lady, but her. lectures. are. painfully. boring. Rough to sit through. I feel like skipping the lecture and doing your own studying would be more useful, esp. since she posts the powerpoints on blackboard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2007<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>They changed the class from before..so it's a little harder. lab quizzes (but they tell you when they are) and 3 exams (all multiple choice). Exams are tough, most of the stuff on the study guide didn't show up on the test but still an okay class. very interesting stuff... i did learn a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2007<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a good teacher who definitely knows what she's talking about. The class itself is very interesting, and as long as you keep up with the homework you shouldn't have trouble doing well. The tests are really hard, but there's always a huge curve.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2007<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>B- was my grade. Granted, I didn't read the chapters, and I missed a couple lectures, but make sure you your final paper is flawless! She is really picky about that. Also, know the slides, statistics, and skim through the chapters. Long chapters, crazy amount of slides, but a great class that every girl should take. Take it if you can get in!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You've got to take this class.  It will blow your mind.  It is so interesting and Jennifer and Linda Graf make it so fun.  It is a great substitution to the needed &quot;Lab&quot; requirement.  Lab one day a week, Lecture another.  Assignments are out of a workbook and are interesting and two papers.  Girls Rule!!!  Take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is really nice and knows her stuff! learned more about birth than i want to but overall the class was awesome. an easy lab option because there is hardly any lab work involved. the tests were hard though. don't count on the study guides! and you can get away without even buying the book because lectures are on blackboard</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was so interesting. Finally a class that you as a woman can relate to. Linda is so nice. This is how all teachers should be! Best class ever.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2005<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The lectures were boring. The labs were pointless. Almost always got out early. Class consists of 2 papers, lab workbook assignments, Midterm and final. The midterm and final were actually difficult. I expected an easy A but got a B+. If you dont want a real science class, take this one.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2005<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>professor graf is so awesome i loved every second of her class!! she is one of the sweetest women and is REALLY interested in her students and her subject matter! it's the best option for a lab,whether you're a guy or a girl,and she is just an absolute doll! get her while you can!!!! SO great</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2005<br>Class Name: NSG230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loooved her!
