Despite his &quot;everything is discussible&quot; idea, he spent most of the class talking himself and going on long rambles that could be incredibly dull.

If you participate and put forth a decent effort you should be fine.  This isn't a class you can skip or sleep in, but it's not impossible either.  He teaches to the text, so read!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2010<br>Class Name: PHL390<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a professor who teaches Logic in a very illogical manner.  He's unclear, he takes all of the answers straight from the book and even then makes mistakes on proofs.  If you don't get an answer right (he calls on everyone) you feel humiliated.  I took an intro to logic course and did well the quarter before then did terrible in this course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard, harsh, unfair.

Very whimsical, intriguing, funny, and attractive! Helped me think things through on abstract levels that I enjoy. Papers, at least the term paper, is self-directed/chosen, but this is helpful in developing my own ideas and giving me the creative base to do this. Thank you Professor Pellauer!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2009<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Contrary to my initial thoughts, this class turned out to be one of my favorite and most memorable classes at DePaul. Dr. Pellauer's still got it - he's enthusiastic and clear in his lectures. The only downside to this class was some classmates who have anything but respect for him and his thought-provoking insights on philosophy. Take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2009<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pellauer gets a bad rap. He's got something of a non-traditional teaching method; his paper topics are broad, for the purpose of making you explore your own ideas as opposed to regurgitating facts. Thought-provoking course. I was extremely disappointed with how childish my classmates were when forced to try something outside their comfort zones.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2009<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the papers arent that hard to write, he's not picky about tone or even lenght, he just wants you to convey and support good ideas. plus, you get rewrites.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2009<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's quirky and he'll help if you ask for it. he's real open to answering questions and &quot;everything is discussable&quot; it is, after all, a philosophy class. he knows his stuff well and i think he does a great job</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was really interesting and I think it worked out well as my first philo class.  He's a weird guy, kind of has a creepy breathy laugh&#63; It bothered me, but he's REALLY into class participation which is like 25% of your grade. Then there's 3 papers and a journal. You can rewrite the papers that he doesn't grade that hard in the first place.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2008<br>Class Name: PHL350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is like the worst professor ever.

However, the class conversations can get really confusing. I didn't understand much of what we talked about. He is a really fair grader and will let you rewrite papers as many times as you want. He is also open to discussing moving due dates and the like.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2007<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be ready for some critical analysis, this guy is very tough for an introductory class to philosophy. While you ARE able to rewrite essays, his grading is enormously hard. Without strong writing skills, you WILL fail this class. He lacks an ability to help you fix the essay but is very ready to criticize it. This class was the worst.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2007<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite non-science professors. If you are bad at writing a decent essay I would not recommend you for his class. He is brilliant. He does not rebuff anyones ideas or opinions, but he does challenge your thoughts in order to make you think more in depth. He is the reason I'm gonna be a philo minor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2006<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked him.  He forced you to think and produced interesting discussions among the students.  He writes for the Philosophy Today journal and knows lots of famous &quot;thinkers.&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2006<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No one has mentioned his striking resemblance to Ross from 'Friends' (both in looks and personality). I recommend any of his classes for only those really interested in philosophical issues.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2006<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So he lets you rewrite every paper until you get a grade you like which he then accepts without averaging. There are a few minor other assignments but you need to speak up in class to be able to get an A even if you get A's on all your papers. Yes he expects a little to much but he is willing to work with you and ur grade in the end.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2006<br>Class Name: SYMBOLICLOGIC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He sucks, doesn't explain anything, but expects you to know the material immediately. When I tried to get help he wasn't even available during office hours. Doesn't respond to emails ever.  Avoid this teacher if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems a bit crazy, but is overall a good teacher and  knows his stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: EXISTENTIALTHE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's smart, but he dials in the lectures by having a TA there.  He knows philosophy, but is a bit too dogmatic when it comes established thought.

He’s not easy, so don’t take him if you want a blow-off class.  He’s probably one of the few professors at DePaul who actually is abreast of new ideas and current interpretations of philosophical notions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is horrible.

Must be willing to get past his un-dynamic teaching style, but he has an incredible wealth of knowledge to share.  Also a very kind man who, unlike many DePaul professors, is very responsive and willing to help you outside of class. Overall, one of my favorite DePaul professors.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2004<br>Class Name: PHL237<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy thinks he knows everything. he comes up with a weird idea and gives it a name and tries to pass it along to the students like its gospel. i mean he's smart. but he shouldn't be teaching his undeveloped philosophical ideas to students without getting feedback from other people first.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy likes to pick favorites and then dump on students that don't agree with him.
