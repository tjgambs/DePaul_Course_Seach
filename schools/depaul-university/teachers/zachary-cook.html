He is easy and predictable. He assigns a f*** ton of reading but you can get by doing next to none of it. His lectures are interesting and he always brings in guest speakers. Feels like I've met half of the Illinois government thanks to him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2015<br>Class Name: PSC328<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my second time having Zach. He's very clear-cut (which is a  good thing for poli sci). However the standard poli sci stuff are here: long readings, a term paper, a midterm and final (both consisting of Terms to ID and 2 essay questions). He does let you use  an assistance sheet on the tests. He brings many guest speakers. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Coo is the best poli sci lecturer I've had at Depaul. But he brings the typical poli sci stuff: long readings, a midtermfinal, and final paper. He is  very clear on what he expects on the writing assignments and tests. He can be quite funny and he likes to incorporate pop culture references to concepts, such as Green Lantern, Batman and Ultron</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cook is a really funny guy! Super nice and intelligent. If you ask for help you will get it. Just put in a lot of effort and you're good to go. I HATE politics and got stuck in that class but surprisingly it was still somewhat pleasant!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2014<br>Class Name: EXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor! Professor Cook offers feedback on rough drafts and has no quizzes. No homework, but many field trips and class speakers - make sure to take notes, it will be essential to passing his class! The book is also mandatory for the midterm and the final essay.  Professor cook is devoted to politics, if it's your calling, take the class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: PSC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cook is really nice and really wants his students to do well. He is a hard grader on papers, but he is very clear about what he wants.  A lot of guest speakers who are very interesting, but also a lot of reading. 2 short papers, 1 final paper, midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2014<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Cook tailors his syllabus to each class's interest which is great. He brings in guest speakers too. Not the greatest class participation, but it is a requirement for a lot of majors so that's understandable. Midterm and final are relatively easy, but definitely require a fair amount of studying to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2013<br>Class Name: HC257<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Cook knows the subject matter which means he's very comfortable either discussing the material from the text or from his own experience. He keeps the conversation going even online which is more than I can say for other online instructors. He also motivates you to think so come prepared to contribute to the conversation -- or lose points.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2013<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>expects way too much from an intro level class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2013<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cook really took time to help with any feedback, or questions I had. I was not initially looking forward to taking this class because Im not interested in politics but he made it interesting. He is a great professor especially if you have never taken a political science class before.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>take him, excellent professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2012<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class was mostly lectures, but he made them interesting and I learned a lot in this class.

He calls on people in class, so do your homework and come to class. He is understanding, but is a tough paper grader. His midterm and final exams were relatively easy. Doesn't make eye contact and tends to look off when students make comments, which was a little aggravating.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2012<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this is now my second class with prof. cook and i cannot recommend him highly enough. if you have even the slightest interest in american politics he makes it interesting, relevant, and enjoyable. he does believe in cold-calling on people though so you do actually need to do the readings to avoid embarrassment but overall just an awesome professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2012<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cook is such a great guy. He offers class makeups by sitting down with a cup of coffee and just talking politics. He knows his stuff and makes the class interesting. Not much work, other than articles and a few chapters.  Two exams and if you study for them, you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2012<br>Class Name: PSC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>class was usually interesting. he is  extremely intelligent and during lecture can sometimes not realize he's talking about things the class may not completely understand, but during office hours is beyond helpful!! his midterm and final are easy, gives the vocab beforehand. take him if polisci major</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2012<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very knowledgeable and kind of funny with his jokes. He does everything he can to answer your questions. While the class is a little hard, he is a very fair grader. It's what you would expect from a PoliSci class. I would recommend him as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2011<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very abstract thinker and I think he's aware of this and tries to be clear but, still has a hard time being interactive and engaging students. I absolutely hated that for both the midterm and the final it was a test and paper. I wish he would just let student focus on one. He is nice and clearly knows his stuff but, can be a little boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2010<br>Class Name: PSC222<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As others have stated, Cook is intelligent and knows the subject matter well.  He wants the best for his students. However, I have to agree with the individual who said that he fails to engage the class effectively.  For someone who puts such heavy emphasis on participation, he doesn't really make the class feel &quot;open&quot;.  Quality prof otherwise.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2010<br>Class Name: PSC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, grades things pretty easily. Midterm and final are pretty easy two separate sections on each, one vocab and one essay part. Not hard at all, class can be boring sometimes, despite efforts otherwise. Cook is very well informed though and strives to make his students happy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2010<br>Class Name: PSC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor tries to engage the class but fails to do so effectively. He offers plenty of help on assignments. Midterms and Finals are very easy. But his grading style is very horrible as he marks down for grammar and little things instead of the main plot or the actual answer.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2010<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very difficult professor. Very strict grader. Attendance is mandatory. Class was filled with non-majors and he took it entirely too seriously. Tons of reading, two papers, lots of required participation. I took his class as an elective, and I wish I hadn't. If you're a polisci major, I'd recommend him, he knows his stuff. If not, stay far away.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2010<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's the alan shore of professors. politics isn't usually my bag, but I cant help to pay attention when he's talking. he knows his subject and he understands his students, even the ones that are too shy to speak.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2010<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Puts tougher ideas into easier to comprehend sections.  Grades the midterm really hard but vocab sections on that and the final are pretty easier, just 3-4 sentences.  Cares a lot and will do independent research to answer all questions.  Attendance mandatory but can be made up in office hours. Emails all lecture notes to u too :D</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2010<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good professor who relates better to the younger students he teaches rather than the old fogies in the teachers lounge.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2010<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cook is cool. He makes funny clever comments and is into his subject. He likes the Saints, gives out a lot of readings, and grades fairly. You pay attention and participate your fine.

Wants you to learn and works really hard to bring in speakers to make it intrested. He can help you outside of school too, he got me an internship with city politics.

I'd definitely recommend.  Wasn't supposed to be in his politics class but professor moved and couldn't teach original explore class.  Ended up really liking the class-learned alot.  Fair grader.  Attendance mandatory but he tries to make it interesting.  I'd take him again.  Midterm was just definitions, 2 papers (1=final)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor.

Awesome professor, extremely helpful, and very nice...which really helps stressful students. Attendance is mandatory but if you drop by his office to talk abt readings, he'll excuse the absence. Take him if you can! The class was interesting and he was a great teacher. He's the most helpful professor I've ever had at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2009<br>Class Name: PSC216<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good professor.

He's interesting and incorporates funny youtube videos. He also brought in a controversial anti-gay rights speaker. I was told he was a hard grader but he seems fair. As long as you have something to say, you can do good in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool Dude.

I think he's especially motivated because he is pretty young, and he's incredibly easy to contact with questions not to mention very responsive.  Lets you stop by during office hours to discuss readings in order to make up for lost participation or absence.  Would def take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An amazing professor.  Comes very well prepaired for his classes and expects the same level of prepairdness from his students.  His grading is a little tough but if you do the work and actually put effort into it you'll do fine, and you'll learn something.  Deffinatly take him if you get the chance because he makes the class worthwile.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He comes VERY well prepared for class and is enthusiastic and smart! Extremely understanding--requires attendance but can be made up through office hours. Will go the extra mile to make sure his material is understood (posts notes, etc).

Will go the extra 10 miles to help students; will talk to you and treat you as a peer.  Gives extensive notes on drafts of papers.  Surprised by the tough grading at the very end of the class.  Expected an A but got an A-.

He is one of the most knowlegable profs I've encountered at DePaul, although he appears quite young. His exams are challenging, yet nonetheless fair. He will go the extra mile to help you. His class stucture is very innovative and well designed--especially in respect to its effectiveness.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: PSC221<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took his Congress class as an elective which was a HUGE mistake.  TEN PAGE RESEARCH PAPER for a random 200 level class If you're a political science major, or minor, he's a pretty good professor overall. Pretty tough grader though.  Class is let out 10mins early every class. Didn't enjoy the reading.  Notes kinda random.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>cool guy. very interesting. gives easy assignments and interesting readings. i recommend him to anyone</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgable about politics and current events.

I like that he didn't give us mindless busy work (although there is a lot of reading). The notes seemed kinda random-read the lecture notes on BB and its mostly cleared up. There are three pretty easy papers and the final. It's a good class. Take him if u can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: PSC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, I enjoyed this professor. He's very responsive to questions, friendly, and seems to enjoy what he does. Notes are a bit difficult to take down, kind of sporadic, but does have lecture notes online. Participation worth too much of your grade, so please say something everyday. Fair grader. Hugable character. :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: PSC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cook is a great professor who doesn't pile on an ungodly amount of work. He brings in guest speakers and he's not too anal about &quot;the rules&quot;. He cares more about &quot;getting it&quot; and not so much about busy work or needless homework. Take him, he's good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is really enjoyable.  He is very much in favor of debate and discussion.  Be prepared to read a lot and share your knowledge before the class though.  Also attendance is a big part of his class.  Participate a lot!!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
