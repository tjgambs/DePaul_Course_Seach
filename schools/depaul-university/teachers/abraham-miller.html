The class material was very clear and laid out in chronological order.  Abe is able to teach "what will be on the PMP exam" and "how it is in the real world" simultaneously.  I would highly recommend Abe as an instructor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2015<br>Class Name: PMCC1PMCC2<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Abe has great enthusiasm for the subject material, and this can be infectious to his students. He motivates the class well to thoroughly complete assignments. Abe encourages class participation, and knows how to lighten the atmosphere in order to generate interest and focus. He is very knowledgeable and is approachable outside of class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2015<br>Class Name: PMCC1PMCC2<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Abe was an exceptional teacher who incorporated his daily work experience as a PM into his teaching. This was very helpful because we could see how what we were learning could be applied in the real world. His classes were full of information, but they were interesting and interactive. He didn't just lecture, class participation was encouraged. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2015<br>Class Name: PMCC1PMCC2<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. His lectures gave both textbook and real life examples with meaningful advice. Abe is one of the best teachers I've ever had.

You need to do the readings, but you will definitely learn a lot. Class is interactive and stimulating - and Abe is really funny! Material is both academic and practical. I was applying what I was learning throughout classes to my job as a project manager. Extremely valuable classes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2015<br>Class Name: PMCC1PMCC2<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Loved both sessions (PMCC1 and PMCC2).
