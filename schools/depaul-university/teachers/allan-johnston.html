	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

He is a weird grader and kind of tough.  He is an unfair grader in my opinion.  Bring your laptop, there is no point of paying attention because his lectures are pointless and make no sense.  But attend class cause he checks attendance.  Try and participate once per class.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>This class was moderately easy, but professor johnston was very very unclear about assignments, due dates, etc. He is very particular about grammar and vocabulary and it will drive you crazy.

Prepare for journals and repetitive papers. I do not recommend him. He doesn't update anything online and his syllabus is very, very vague.

In a class where the material is already dry...he makes it sand.

I dreaded going to class the mandatory 2 times a week, would rather stabbed myself in the eye for an A than sit through his class. We covered bibliographies for at least 6 class meetings. I called this class Hearts 101 because I played it everyday on my phone.
