What made her classroom environment to shine even more was because of her dedication. I thought I was going to struggle just to get a B but I felt very thankful. VERY LOVELY TEACHER WHO IS ALWAYS WILLING TO HELP!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh you'll love her! She helped me become one of the winners of DePaul's First Year Writing Showcase!! More importantly, she does everything she can to prepare for each class and you'll definitely enjoy classes with her. Recommended!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mrs. Friddle turned a class I had no interest in taking into my favorite class. She finds ways to keep things fresh and fun, while at the same time getting the material across. She's also very nice and approachable for any questions or comments. A great professor and highly recommended to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy to get an A in this class; all you need to do is attend class and do the readings. Easy grader, nice lady.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really great. She will help you get an A if you try. Her philosophy on learning and grading are really down to Earth, she realizes that students are people too and not livestock :) The readings can get long and boring but she has suggested skimming them, as long as you get the main idea.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>young and excited about teaching. easy papers, boring class, but she knows it and tries to make it fun by showing clips of parks & rec and the daily show and baking cookies for everyone. tight clothes. get on her good side and pretend like u care and u can get an A or B. only annoying part was creating an e-portfolio at the end of the class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty easy grader, but not when it comes to the papers. Make sure you read everything because she will call on you at random. Overall just ehhh</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher. Very helpful and a really nice person. You use the text book a lot but the work is fairly easy. I learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very nice woman but class is a bit boring. You HAVE to do the readings. She picks on people at random, regardless of whether or not you know the material. The whole course basically revolves around the final, which is an 8 page argumentative paper on a topic of your choice. You also have to give an 8-10 min. presentation on said topic. Meh.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an okay teacher. Class was very boring because we would have to read all of the sections she assigned from the books and write writing responses, which got repetitive. She is very structured when it comes to grading, so make sure you meet all the criteria. She is nice to meet with you before you turn in a paper which is helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely helpful! decent grader... meets with everyone before a paper is due so she can review it. shes so nice! take her!!!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
