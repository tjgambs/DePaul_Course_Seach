She is really caring about her students and wants you to do well. She also offers extra credit and her lectures aren't bad and she is always there for you if you need help. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2014<br>Class Name: 202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Martinez is the best! I have taken her for three years and she is very friendly and helpful with Spanish. The courses I have taken are challenging, but not overbearing at all. As long as you do the work, you will learn a lot! Definitely take over other Spanish teachers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is honestly the most amazing sweet teacher, she really cares about your grade. She is so helpful and her personality is so adorable you want to do your classwork, the final is an oral exam and you have 4 chapter quizzes but they are so easy if you study overall this class was a blast you will absolutely LOVE sra.

She is so nice and helpful. She is willing to go out of her way to help you. Her tests are a little tough and I disliked how she explained all the grammar in Spanish, but she is really easy to understand when she talks in Spanish which makes it extremely helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2011<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great teacher. So funny and knowledgeable. You'll use the textbook a lot but the tests are completely do-able. Sometimes the homework gets hard but she'll help you as long as you ask. TAKE HER.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2010<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Martinez is genuinely interested in the subject she is teaching. Although sometimes the directions may not be clear on an assignment, she is very helpful and approachable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2008<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy easy easy.4 tests, bs group work in class everyday, online hw no biggie, 1 grp presentation. helpful, excited 2 teach, encourages participation but u won't b embarrassed or shy, she just wants to help you out. great lady grades a little harder than most spanish profs tho. that was a bit of a shock. but everything else u do will cushion that.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: SPN370<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had her for intermediate levels and she was much more organized...nice lady and easy class...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2008<br>Class Name: SPN126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a sweet lady, but not very clear. She's a push over and she knows it so she will try and act firm by screwing you over on make-ups if your ever sick. If your a healthy kid you'll be fine, if not, find a more understanding professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2008<br>Class Name: SPN125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Senora Martinez is a good teacher. She easy to get along with, and her class is super easy if you look over the book and study for tests. Make sure you are clear  with about make-up test though.. she told me not to worry about one and gave me a 0%!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: SPN126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is wonderful! Class can drag sometimes, but the material and the tests are sooo easy. Her enthusiasm is great encouragement to keep studying Spanish. I also HIGHLY recommend the service learning portion--it can be very rewarding and insightful. I  felt like my conversational skills improved  because of the additional outside practice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2006<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Me encanta Senora Martinez!

My biggest gripe was that her explanations weren't always thorough. Very tough grader. Never responds to emails. Not my favorite spanish professor at Depaul, sorry.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2006<br>Class Name: SPN104105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DULL.  Worst hour and a half of my day.  All we do is go over the book. &quot;Now lets do exercise 1, now 2, and 3, and 4...&quot;  Class is EASY.  I never studied for an exam, put no effort into the compositions, basically just showed up for class and and got a B.  Take her if you want an easy class but are willing to suffer for it.  Really nice lady though</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2005<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Nice Lady.  She makes class fun and incorporates everyone into her discussions.  Do the homework and study for the exams and you will be fine.  No Final!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So nice.

I give her a lot of credit for opening up my mind to latin american culture.  I took her for a latin american film class and class was never boring, always very interesting.  Now I consider latin american films as my favorite type of genre.  This lady knows her stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2004<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a total sweetheart, the class is fun to attend and not terribly hard, either.

Intelligent, but not very open-minded.  The world is unfair, but it's not something that a professor should dwell on while teaching a class.  Not willing to give any extra credit or help with anything!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2004<br>Class Name: FOCALPOIN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a wonderful teacher, she is very  very helpful, understanding, nice, and very knowledgeable about the subject.

I guess I could say she tried hard, but the whole course just didn't seem very well prepared.  Good choices for the books though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2003<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take her classes if you have an interest, dont listen to the people that say she demands too much.
