			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

She  assigns way too much work to do every week. She clearly does not take into consideration that her class is not the only class her students take.

She is not a tough grader and the material is not hard -but- the amount of work she assigns have become annoying. I'd rather do a few longer assignments than multiple, small, tedious assignments. So, be prepared for large but easy workload for her online class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chill class, kinda rac1st but dont take it serious. It's true you don't get grades, but i doubt she is a hard grader. I got an A in the end and it was't too bad. No final, reflection papers (1 page) pretty much every week easy, 2 presentations,5 page essay on a movie about food.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2012<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher actually provided some useful and interesting facts, but lectures were mostly boring being 4 hours long. Sounded like a fun class at first but it turned out to be a drag in the end due to her rudeness. The only good parts about this class was leaving class for food and NO final.

No text.  Take notes in class and study off the slides she puts on D2L.  There was an 8 page paper on a piece of architecture but it wasn't so bad.  She made the class very interesting and fun.  Learned a lot!  Highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2011<br>Class Name: HAA230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very nice lady and very into the subject (kinda funny too). Though I admit the 8 page paper was a bit much for a summer class, if it were a reg. class it wouldn't have been so bad. Quizzes (4) are easy if you take notes & study a little before. No book, don't really even have to read the stuff online either if you take notes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's not that bad.... but she teaches this 100 level class like it's a 300 level class. she talks too fast for you to take notes, and expects a SIX PAGE PAPER on a piece of art WITHOUT using internet sources. kind of funny, but not really.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't understand why Professor Zurybida is getting loads of negative comments.

Never got any of our work back. She would usually let us leave at 4 but we would be all the way across town so it ended up taking an hour to get back to Lincoln Park and even longer to get back to the loop. title of class makes it sound like fun but it is NOT!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2010<br>Class Name: HAA230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her teaching a lot. Class is just pretty much constant note taking but the midterm and final are not hard, if you can memorize stuff it'll take you two seconds to finish. You have to write an 8 page paper about a topic the only difficult thing about that is its length. she has favorites and jokes around in class good teacher overall.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2010<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't understand all the bad ratings, she tried very hard to be engaging for all of the students which I really appreciate.  She's nice, she's approachable and I thought she was a very fair grader.  She has favorites, but she doesn't count that against the others in her class.  I found her class enjoyable and learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2010<br>Class Name: EXPLO5509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWFUL, you will never get any feedback and she is a bore.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2009<br>Class Name: EXP111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her for Explore Chicago Through Food.

Waste of a Friday afternoon (12-4). She takes the class way too seriously. She makes you study more about the country than food. You dont get grades back. Reflections every week.
