Super approachable and understanding. Assigns reading reflection papers that are about the assigned reading and the documentary watched in class. Also assigns "formal" papers, which are about reflecting about your personal life.

She has an interactive teaching style rather then lecturing for the whole class.  She is very fun and likes to make class fun.  Every class there is a question of the day such as &quot;What is your favorite pizza place&#63;&quot;  She is quite an interesting person but I love Stepahine and her class!  STRONGLY RECOMEND!!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
