			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

I never got the impression that he was arrogant, condescending, or closed-minded - just the opposite actually. His instruction exemplified the much vaunted critical thinking that the university is supposed to teach. Thanks to him, I found a zeal for romantic poetry. Take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of my favorite English professors I have taken at Depaul. His lectures are very enlightening. He seems to always draw from pop culture and current issues. He weaves this into his lectures and it makes them really fun and interesting. He is very nice and understanding. I recommend to participate a lot and as always read the text assigned! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives extremely insightful, intelligent and creative lectures. He provided handouts to encourage critical reading of the poems we read. The class was a hybrid, which allowed for more time to independently read. He was available for office hours. Prof. Gross is a must take as an English major because he actually teaches you to critically think. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2015<br>Class Name: ENG231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Dr. Grosss teaching style. I enjoyed the class discussions because the information was simply not fed to me but rather I was forced to critically think about the novels and overall understood them better. Dr. Gross provided modern comparisons to enhance my understanding of the material. I would definitely take again. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2015<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is so intelligent, but he has no organization. He knows his stuff, but his thoughts are often poorly communicated and go off into a thousand tangents. He asks that you read quite a bit, but it's not the worst content nor the hardest. I would say that he is a helpful teacher, but there's barely any assignments to ask for help on.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: 231<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked him as a professor. He was frazzled at times and didn't have a clear class structure, but that was kind of fun. We did have to read a bit, but it wasn't too bad. He doesn't give clear grades or post anything on D2L. I didn't know where I stood in his class until after our final grades were turned in. But funny guy in his own way.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2014<br>Class Name: ENG442<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor and so humane.

However, he lacks any "teaching" skills, is terribly condescending, arrogant, and takes disorganization to a new extreme.  While clearly a great scholar, he was neither a good teacher nor a particularly nice person.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: ENG471<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow. I am amazed at how disorganized he is; he decided to change the syllabus mid-way through the course. He doesn't respect students' time or opinions, and his arrogance becomes really frustrating.  He doesn't listen at all to student reports and consistently interrupts them and makes condescending comments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2012<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Prof. Gross because, OH MY! You have to do some critical thinking on your own. I am extremely grateful for teachers like him who don't force-feed information into your brain but instead he gives you a piece of critical information and YOU get to expand on that idea. He's not a horrible teacher if you learn how his brain works.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2008<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. not helpful. disjointed and unclear lectures. not willing to TEACH. tremendous (almost impossible) amount of outside reading and/or knowledge necessary to succeed. arrogant, stubborn, closed-minded and whiny.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2007<br>Class Name: ENG349<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor!

(Absolute fount of knowledge, but in an amazing, not cocky way)...very interesting class if you at least participate somewhat - loves when students speak up, even a little.  Few papers, will offer great help if just asked, very easy-going & understanding.

Assignments weren't too bad.  The class is writing intensive and very heavy on discussion.  Though, he asks us to read quite a bit within a small amount of time and be able to analyze in great detail.Class wasboring and it was mostly him talking.Nice&helpful</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very helpful- he'll read a draft of a paper if you're not so sure about its content.  Don't take this class if you aren't going to actually read the material.  Many people in the class that I took chose not to read- the outcome was an extraordinarily boring class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: HON300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Will challenge you more than any other Honors professor. Hopefully, this is a good thing. Unbelievably creative and innovative approach to teaching. If you want to think on a different level this is the man to take. Don't expect an A, however.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2004<br>Class Name: BRITLIT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring lecture.  Seems like a nice guy, but if he senses you don't care he will act like a jerk.  I think he's a fair grader, and he doesn't seem like he would fail anyone.  Probably not a bad choice if you just want to get the class done.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2004<br>Class Name: HON300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is disorganized and very unhelpful.
