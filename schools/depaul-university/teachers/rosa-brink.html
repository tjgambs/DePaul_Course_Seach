Very sweet and funny and likes to practice her English. This particular course (SPN 201) is a review of the most difficult grammar concepts in Spanish, and her teaching style was perfect for that type of course (a review of concepts I already knew). Gives you test review sheets that mirror the test formatquestions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2015<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Brink is a super nice lady! You can tell she cares a lot about her students and wants them to be successful. Class could be really boring sometimes, but that's just the nature of the beast in a grammar class. She understood this and always tried to liven things up. Class material wasn't very hard and her attitude made everything so much better.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2015<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT take this class if you actually want to learn Spanish. All she does is talk about her own life and tells weird stories. I have not learned anything. It's like you're pretty much teaching yourself. If you want a friend more than a teacher and a pretty easy A then take this class but if you actually want to learn then please save yourself time</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2014<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Brink is the greatest. She is very helpful and clear. She wants you to succeed. She is very funny and the class is never boring. As long as all the work she has planned for the day is done she will let you go early. Super nice!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2014<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE her! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2014<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rosa is fantastic! One of the sweetest and funniest professors I've had.

She is my favorite professor by far! You can't help but laugh during class. I actually learned a lot in class too. She's really a great teacher and an easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2012<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was awesome!  You can tell that she really wants everyone to succeed but sometimes can't tell when students need help so make sure you speak up if you have any questions and she will be happy to help!  She grades easy and goes off on funny tangents about her younger years!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2010<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Like most everyone else says,you won't learn Spanish, but she tries to be your friend instead. She was going through a divorce and asked us to answer her phone when her soon to be ex called once and encouraged us to tell him we were dating her!  Geez</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2009<br>Class Name: SPN114<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>gREAT TEACHER. vERY ENTHUSIASTIC AND HELPFUL.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2009<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rosa is a RIOT. Seriously she is straight out of the seventies and she cracks herself up.  But basically the class is like the rest of the series. She grades the oral final really easily. The tests are the same as the others. Class goes by really slowly and I feel like we never got anything done, but we really did&#63; Decent class, funny prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a crazy lady. Like everyone else, I don't recommend her if you're serious about learning the language. I think she's focused on practicing her English rather than you practicing Spanish. She's very funny, and the class is easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2009<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pay attention in class, try to participate as much as you can and do the homework. we had to watch movies outside of class that were fun and I am glad that I had the chance to watch them. Learned alot about grammar in 201 that I didn't know before.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She loves having class parties and all things of the fun-variety, but if you really want to gain experience speaking the language, she is not the professor to take. She almost exclusively spoke her own heavily-accented English the entire quarter, and graded a bit harder than was expected considering the time she took doing real teaching in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2008<br>Class Name: SPA102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's fun, don't take her if you are really into learning the language.  If you have commitment to learning spanish I recommend taking her class and then learning from the book</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE ROSA BRINK! She would also make jokes about her ex husband and going out for margaritas lol! She's really nice and it's an easy A.  She is foreigh so its hard to understand her at times.  But I would recommend her to everyone!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2007<br>Class Name: SPN205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this professor! She is really smart and knows how to make the class fun. It is my last class of the day and she really helps me end it on a good note.  Her assignments are not too hard and she gives you a chance to make corrections to homework to improve your grade.  She is a very fun professor to have.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2007<br>Class Name: SPN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. 2nd time i'm taking her.  funny, sweet, nice, easy grader.  she is truley an asset to dePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her funny comments make the class so much fun! Whether her jokes are in English or Spanish, the students are sure to be laughing at least once during class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2006<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the easiest classes I've taken.  She goes through the book pretty slowly and the assignments aren't hard.  Fun class because she makes a lot of jokes and tells us great stories.  I would recommend her if you want to have a good time in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty easy class.  she jokes a lot, but moves pretty slowly.  she grades homework very easily and papers are not hard at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher, very easy class. The most fun class i've had in college!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2006<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice and funny. She cares about students and you just don't feel that bad that you have to take the class at night.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2006<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Didn't really learn too much, but Brink made night class tolerable.  Funny lady & really nice, and managed to get an A without studying at all, and putting little to no effort into the papers. If you're taking spanish as a LA&S or HON requirement and just need to get it out of the way, Brink's the prof to take. blow off class for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2006<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes really nice.  kind of boring but it's bearable.  She doesnt accept any late work or xtra credit, and she gives a little too much homework.  But, i got A's on 2 exams and an A on a paper that sucked so shes a really easy grader.  Shes funny, too.  Take her class if you arent that great in SPN and you will do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2006<br>Class Name: SPAN201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Brink is very organized and makes learning fun!  I have had so many boring teachers who killed my interest, but not in this case!  You can tell that she spends a lot of time preparing and you will learn a lot from her.  She has a wonderful sense of humour as well!  I would recommend her to anyone who wishes to learn Spanish! Always helpful!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2006<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a nice lady but not a good teacher.  Yes, she's easy but you won't learn anything.  DO NOT take her if you're a Spn major because this class is a joke and won't help you in spanish at all.  She let's you out of class after 45 min when it's a 1.5 hr class.  Again, you won't learn anything AT ALL.  Nice lady, but disorganizaed and unprepared!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: SPN205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the hands down the best class I have taken at DP out of all 8 so far LoL... Hopefully you understand her well- she kinds speaks spanglish with a thick accent, but it's loveable!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2005<br>Class Name: SPN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Profesora Brink talks funny but is a lot of fun.  A lot of things to do but she is really easy going and not strict at all.  This class is all talking, which she loves.  It goes really quickly and is pretty enjoyable.  She is a huge Venzuelan sweetheart.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2005<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Update, I got a 100, 100, and a 90.
