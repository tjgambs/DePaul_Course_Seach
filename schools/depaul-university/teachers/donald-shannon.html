He gives the class his online lectures which are the most helpful.  Tough tests but fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2008<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Eh, yeah the online class is hard, the tests are brutal! Dr. Don is very very persistent in contacting you if there's a problem, and actually spent a lot of time on the phone with me going thru problems. Hard, but if you're interested in learning, he's interested in teaching you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2007<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I cannot emphasize how horrible this professor is.  This was quite possibly the worse class experience I have ever had.  He was horrible at explaining the material, and even worse when it came to approachability.  The only good thing about his class was the online tools that were available.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2007<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests are online on Sundays; Group projects are due on random days (often Saturdays) and at very specific times (5-7pm). Prof doesn't seem to understand that we have work/other classes/lives. If you take this prof here's some advice:  You don't need to go to class, just read/memorize the book.  Use the Eduspace practice tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2007<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very smart and pationate with what he does. went out of his way to get in contact with me to let me know about a problem. Class is not mandatory but highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2007<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unorganized and unfocused lectures; starts on topic but spins off into personal stories. Very knowledgable but sarcastic; only way to ace class is to read textbook. I would recommend a different professor for a basic accounting class. This professor is probably most useful at the graduate level.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2007<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please don't take unless you want to fail.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>would not recommend this guy at all.  The class topics discussed barely tied to the tests, discourages questions, even though he is knowledgeable it is difficult to extract it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2007<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most disorganized online class ever.  Syllabus had no estimates for when tests/group projects would be, and he would send out e-mail notifications on a Tuesday that there was a test due by Wednesday night. Plus, the tests were extremely tough!  He said to call him if we had questions, but when we called he made it feel like we were wasting his time</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2006<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>maybe its because i took this course over the summer...but i thought this teacher was BRUTAL with his tests...he was very interesting and funny as a person and he did explain everything as thorough as we asked but nothing could ever prepare us for his tests...we were even given a 2 sided cheat sheet and he STILL had to curve 16% w/ppl still failing</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2006<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Don is a real asset to DePaul. I would definately reccommend taking him based solely on what he offers. Very intelligent when it comes to ACC and he's a Duke and UNC graduate.  Good guy, really wants to help everyone and tries to pass everyone (as long as you at least show interest). Anyway, I enjoyed his class and I hate accounting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2006<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher. He telling what is important in the class. Just study, you will pass.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2006<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DONT!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2006<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor, he obviously spent lots of time developing materials for the class and it shows.  He is very clear and makes accounting as interesting as possible.  Keep up with the work and you'll do fine in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Don is a great guy who has a dry sence of humor.  ACC 500 was not the not enjoyable subject, but Dr Don made it palatable.  He does rely on his slides, but they are used to help you understand the subject.  Use the practice tests in the book for clues on the test -Dr Don uses the author's test questions for the exams.  Summer class = short pain.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2005<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a funny guy but he sucks as a teacher and he's not really good with putting time after class, like he's lazy and just doesnt want to really teach. He really depends on his slides and he is really confusing expects a lot from you. His test are hard and he just doesnt help, horrible teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2005<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. S is a great guy and makes a brutal subject moderatly interesting.  No issues with him at all.  This class is far from a joke though expect to put in a fair amount of time and do yourself a favor DO NOT TAKE IT OVER the summer if you have no ACC experience.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2005<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor. There should be more professor like him at DePaul. I am not happy with his class because it was easy but that he was very clear, fair, and made the subject fun. He has a good sense of humor and actually made accouting interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: ACC<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY GOOD TEACHER.
