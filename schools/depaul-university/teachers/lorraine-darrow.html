Prof. Darrow was such a sweetheart, and her huge passion for film was definitely evident. Her feedback on our work was always incredibly helpful, and class itself was so much fun. I almost wish that I hadn't passed so I could take the course again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this class and loved Professor Darrow. She has a thick french accent but is easily understandable. She gives great lectures and you seriously learn A LOT from her. She made me love screenwriting. This is a fun class and you always watch movie clips of relevant films. She will help you in person or through email! Definitely recommend her!  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is AMAZING! She really does care about her students well being in and out of class. She goes above and beyond to help her students succeed. I highly recommend her! Very nice lady and an excellent teacher! Take her if you can! =)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Lorraine was wonderful! She has a thick French accent, however she manages to effectively lecture. We watched several interesting shorts and scenes that I really enjoyed. Her expectations are straightforward and her criticisms are very useful. Follow her guidelines and put forth the effort and you will do well in this class.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
