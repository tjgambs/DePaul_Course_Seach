He is clearly on top of his game in terms of being informed of the news and buzz in the economics world. You'll definitely get your money's worth by taking his class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2014<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>SERIOUSLY! Very animated teacher. Will definitely hold your interest. Any time I needed help I felt he was readily available to answer any questions. Throws some humor into his class which keeps it interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was hospitalized for a mental procedure and I missed most of the course.

I have to have a medical procedure on the day of this course Final.

Seriously?</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2014<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oldfashioned guy with a weird sense of humor but good teacher. Explains everything well and over all an easy class! Lots of notes but he his really helpful. One down turn is that doesn't accept any late work whatsoever</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2014<br>Class Name: ECO201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is bad. Yes he knows economics, but this class is so much effort for such little gain. He tries to act funny in class to supplement for being a ridiculous grader, and if you ask him about the homework or work with other classmates he'll just assume you're cheating and mark it wrong. Do yourself a favor, just find another teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2013<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's funny and he knows what he's talking about. Only one teaching style: lectures. Goes over EVERYTHING that will be on midterm and final. If you miss class he'll email you the homework assignment. The homework can be time consuming and he takes it for a grade instead of completion. No tests or quizzes outside of midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2013<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just aced final exam with Doctor Larry. He told us exactly what to study and what to ignore. It was m/c and probs like the hw all qtr. He gave bonus pts for doing the last hw. I aced both his exams becuase he is  straight forward w no games and doesn't waste time. Many of the others seemed slow making me rethink DPU $ and think of transfer to UIUC.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2013<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a nice guy and a really good teacher-one of the best I have had at DePaul. Prof is available before and after every class. He came prepared. And he always had funny stories to share about life and economics. Unlike the last poster, he GAVE extra credit. I wish he taught more. He also wrote great letters of recommend for me too! Great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2013<br>Class Name: MACROECONOMICS<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very tough. Gives you really long homework assignments. The grading scale makes it tough. I asked for extra credit, but he did not give me any. Pretty entertaining, but he doesn't explain the material as well as other professors I've had. If you take him expect to work extra hard, otherwise your grade will bring your GPA down!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2013<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly entertaining.  Make sure you know & use the proper vocabulary for homework and quizzes.  The course material was pretty easy (it was intro to macro econ), but he did give extra credit anyway.  Do the homework, check your answers, take notes/pay attention in class), and you will have no problem getting an "A".</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Larry is hilarious and keeps the class engaged in lectures. He actually makes the material fun. Very clear and teaches you exactly what you need to know. RECOMMEND ALWAYS!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2013<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hilarious teacher, he goes over everything that will be on the Mid Term and Final Exam. Class is extremely boring. One problem is that he is useless when it comes to emailing him questions and is stubborn when it comes to the Mid-term and final exam.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof is a good teacher who really cares about students and enjoys what he is teaching. He uses his own text and study guide which include only what we will cover to help save us money. Always available to answer questions. Good sense of humor. Keeps us involved in  intro macro. I switched to  double major econ and acctg thanks to him. Take him :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am an Economics major so I was really looking forward to this class. Dr. Frateschi is a good teacher but needs improvement in his lesson plans. He does things out of order and gets off topic. Homework is easy but long and the midterm/final were alright if you followed the class notes and read the study guide. He is very helpful if you need it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2012<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really quirky and funny teacher. Class material does get dry at times but he does his best to try to make it interesting with offbeat jokes. You can't screw around too much during lectures and there is some homework, but if you put in your work it should be straightforward in acing the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2012<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rick Ross the Boss. Very straight forward class, you can get an A if you do the homework no problem. I took him for both 105 and 106. Roaze out</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2012<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a hilarious teacher. He made me laugh multiple times every class. He always talks about he is an old goofball. I aced the midterm without a problem. He told us everything that would be on it. Final was harder though. Homework is graded for correctness so I did not do too well on hw. He will stay after to help. I would like to take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy. Homework counts 20%, Midterm counts 40%, and Final counts 40%. If you do the HW (about 15 assignments and he drops the 2 lowest) you will ace the exams because he asked basically the same questions from hw. Lots of slackers will ask to copy your hw and then he catches them for cheating. Do the work ace class. I would take another w him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>does anyone know if this teacher gives any ex credot&#63; the homeworks killed me!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TOO MUCH UNNEEDED HW! Literally every class he will give you busy work, about 2-3 hours of daily hw that is scrutinized when graded. Can't bs the hw either, it's pure busy work. This is a pre-req class, why make it difficult&#63; Yes, he's nice and quirky, but take someone who understands there place.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2011<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not sure if he's still teaching, very funny guy but he gives lots of homework. Midterm and final are relatively easy if you did the homework and also the online questions</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2011<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely hilarious. It was a pleasure it be in his class. The only bad part is he might not be back to teach anymore :( goes over the homework, gives relevant assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2011<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everything is based on the lectures. Grade is based on homework that you get once a week, midterm, & final. I liked this class, I thought it was interesting. He's awkward but funny. & our class was his only class so he put a lot of effort and time into it.

For non-business majors, the class can be hard, but he works with you to help you understand the material. He's prompt with responding to your emails, and he will help you until you understand it. I've never had a more understanding professor. He's great! I highly recommend him! Midterm, Final, Homework, & lots of extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The previous poster must have been that guy who got caught cheating during the final and was crying in the hall to &quot;work something out&quot;. What a ****! I hope they toss him out for good. Prof is nice guy who knows his stuff and is clear. The midterm had a BIG CURVE. And the extra credit gave me B+ from a C-. Do the work. Ask questions. He is great.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good guy who knows his stuff! Prof gives midterm/final and homework but he gives TONS of extra credit. Unless you are a total loser, you can't help but pass. If you want a good grade, just study and no problem. He reviews the whole class before exams. His hw comes from lectures so just attend and pay attention. Stresses current issues. EZ nice guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Course was very interesting especially with the banking crisis going on. Midterm 30% Homework 30% Final 40% Homework from notes and text and study guide. He spends a whole class reviewing for each exam and goes over each question. Quickly answers emails. Always available during office hours. Stresses current issues. Allows email of hw. Good guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible. i have no idea where the positive comments come from, makes you wonder. 2 exams and thats your final grade right there. hes very weird and incomprehensible. very off topic and assigns way too much hw that no one does and he doesnt even go over. save yourself, find some1 else!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does a fantastic job of relating course material to current economic conditions. He keeps things simple enough for everyone to understand. He was available anytime I had questions via email. His assignments aren't difficult but time consuming since they cover all the material. The 2 tests required about 5-6 hours of studying each to earn an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2009<br>Class Name: ECON2203<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very poor professor. Arrogant, weird, and confusing. Homework consists of a ton of busy work. Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. F. is a good teacher overall. Though many people seem to think he talks too fast and assigns too much homework, he is an easy grader if you do the work and you'll understand. He will always ask you if you need him to explain again. The exam wasn't hard if you take good notes, attend class, read the book, practice the study guide and study.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>please, do not waste your time with this guy. class is not extremely hard but homework is long and tedious, exams are average for an economics class, and his off topic/strange comments get old pretty quickly. If you like to ask questions because you are confused--GOOD LUCK. if there is another professor available, do yourself a favor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He spends a lot of time teaching the material and relating it to the real world. There's homework twice a week. He grades everything, so make sure you do the homework with care. The midterm and final were no surprise. Be sure you study on your own and use the study guide. You need to pay attention in class and study at home in order to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enjoyed Prof and found him to be very knowledgeable. I think that he is a great teacher and a really nice guy. Cares about his students' grades and participation, makes class really enjoyable and interesting. I feel I learned a lot.  He remembered everyone's name and found him very approachable. Related topics to current events. 2 exams, hw, ext cr</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Some of the other students in my class were on their 2nd or 3rd time taking it. DOCK is pretty easy: only had midterm, weekly homework, and final. He is available in his office for help. Lectures are clear and uses textbook and study guide to support learning. Read the chapters and the notes before the exams and get an A. Be lazy and don't. Funny!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DOCK is one of my favorite profs at DePaul. I took twice (105 B)(106 A) because he makes class interesting and if you do what he asks of you, which is very little, you do well in his class. Fair grader and good teacher. Winter 09 gave 3 exams CURVED (1st short ans/probs) (2nd probs/mc) (final mc) to give slackers a variety.  TAKE HIM and STUDY HARD</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I taught myself straight from the textbook.  He says that if you do the homework/online quizzes you'll do well..not the case. He changes his testing style from one test to the next so you never know what to expect. I thought he was a nice guy, until I went to his office for help and he basically told me i was lazt. I pulled an A-, but not bc of him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2009<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Professor, one of the best at DePaul. Took the time to work problems on the chalk board and actually teaches material rather than reading power point slides. Great experience. Lots of internet homework which I liked so we kept up with current money and banking issues. Helped me earn a McGowan Scholarship. And speaks English ...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not the worst teacher, but I definitely do not believe that I was graded fairly. I learned alot from the course, but he put too much emphasis on the tests and then decided to take points off for every stupid thing. I would not take him again, but If you know how to kiss up to him, this might be the class for you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE PROFESSOR. 2 TESTS AND A FINAL MAKE UP YOUR GRADE,SO BASICALLY YOURE SCREWED AND I WISHED SOMEONE WOULDVE MENTIONED THAT ON HERE!! ALL TESTS ARE SHORT ANSWER PROBLEMS AND HE TAKES OFF FOR STUPID LITTLE MISTAKES IF YOU DONT ANSWER THOROUGHLY. HE IS ALSO VERY BORING. PLEASE AVOID!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not recommend this professor. He is a horrible grader and he is also very weird. He was ok until he left the whole class shocked at their first exam. He takes off for stupid stuff. If you don't want to be cheated out of your grade, don't take!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2008<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher. He goes off on tangents and does not explain things clearly. His tests are hard and confusing but he does listen to your concerns regarding his testing format and adjusts it. Way too much busy work/homework. One of my least favorite classes/teachers at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2008<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the coursework can be a little tough but he's really helpful and enthusiastic and he's pretty funny too and really knows what he's talking about</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just started teaching here.
