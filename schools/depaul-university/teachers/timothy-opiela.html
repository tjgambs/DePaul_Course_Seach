If you're looking to learn a lot about the subject, take his course.  If you're looking to have a nice GPA on your resume, avoid his course at all costs.  I had straight A's in my MBA program until I took his course.

Only a midterm and final for grades, along with two short essays that he doesn't even read (automatic A's).  However, getting an A in the class is a chore if you don't truly listen and ask questions.  He doesn't teach out of the book, so don't bother buying it.

You will never use the book except for chapter 4 and 7 (you can live without). You must attend every class and take notes as the tests will be on his lectures.

He is unclear, has difficulty in getting his point across, and gets easily frustrated.

You have read before class to understand the lectures. I worked hard for my A, & learned a lot in class.

No quizzes, some homework is required but it is never looked and everyone gets full credit.

You can tell he is smart because of the way he explains concepts (e.g. show the derivation of a formula rather than just write it on the board).  The tests are not easy, but they are fair.  You have to work very hard because there is a LOT of material.  But if you do that, you will succeeed.  I would take another class of his.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smart, knows the material, and a nice guy who cares about the students but the class seemed to be unbearably disorganized at times.

Very knowledgable, but like many, cannot teach very well or too clearly. Expects you to know Econ at Master level, which is kind of uncalled for midlevel course. Overall, I would say to avoid him if you want easy grade, but take him if you're willing to work hard. You will actually learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2006<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really great class.  Not easy, but if you go to class and take lots of notes you will be ok.  The mid-term and final really do test your knowledge, but he is a fair grader.
