Secondly, he's really cool and chill! I enjoyed this class! Homework just consists of reading chapters out of the textbook. Pretty easy! There was a project and a paper. Study for the tests and you'll do fine. Poli Sci Majors should take this!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2012<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extra credit (7%) was offered as an option. Midterm, Final, Short Essay, Partner Project, Attendance, & 2 Quizzes. Lowest quiz grade dropped. Reading assigned for every class. Teacher was not too biased in any direction which is important for this type of class. He is very willing to help. Take this only if you are interested in political science.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2012<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expects WAY too much out of a 100 level, introductory course. Very knowledgable about topic and easy to understand but makes quizzes, tests and papers really in depth and extremely hard for a 100 level course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2012<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool guy, easy to talk to, understanding.

He teaches his class by standing in the front of the room and reads off his power points and lectures the WHOLE time. Not once has he ever had any type of classroom discussion, and he doesn't ask any questions which engage the class to make the topic easier to learn about. Find another teacher!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2010<br>Class Name: PSC235<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great person, but I would not recommend him as a teacher.  I believe he really tries to make the class enjoyable, but his expectations for a 200 level course are ridiculous.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
