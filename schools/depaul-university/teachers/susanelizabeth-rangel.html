Do not walk, RUN from this class!! She does not speak at all and does not allow talking so if you are confused about something in class you are SOL. Ended up dropping the class because I was actually going to fail this 100 level class. Her grading is ridiculous and there is no arguing with her about it</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2011<br>Class Name: ASL101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very difficult grading for a beginner language class. quizzes were unnecessarily hard, as though she wanted us to fail. she didn't respond to emails in a timely manner and missed assignments of mine consistently even though i had proved that i turned it in on many occasions. i'm taking ASL 102 in the loop next time.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
