All the projects that are assigned are requirements by the school not made up by him..he told me himself.  He's a nice guy. The portfolio is kind of hard b/c he doesn't really tell you specifically what to do.  I winged it and ended up getting an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2005<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too many papers for an intern class. 5 papers and 1 presentation for 10 weeks, plus every week we need to post responding to the his long article he assigned.
