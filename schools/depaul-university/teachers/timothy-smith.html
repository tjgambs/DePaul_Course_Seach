It is a 3 hour lab, pretty much you are teaching yourself after watching his boring videos outside of the class and after buying his $70 workbook. He does not explain or help! He is ignorant, disrespectful and cocky! I don't know why he is still at DePaul, he should be fired. Don't waste your money & time!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2013<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a sad excuse for a professor. does not teach at all, just forces you to watch his online videos. he is not motivated, rude to his students, and refuses to help anyone. a lazy, sad old man.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2013<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No test. 4 papers: 2 indiv. and 2 group (choose your own group). All HBS articles/cases. Great professor. VERY practical. He focused on teaching us to analyze situations and support our suggestions with info from the cases. He wanted us to think critically. He thoroughly went over cases in class and pointed out pros and cons of different decisions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2012<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A bit arrogant, class is spent working through cases through discussion coupled with powerpoints.

The problem is the way he grades the group papers. First off, 40% of your grade should not be determined by group work, and all he does is write a number at the top of the paper. No comments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not pass up the opportunity to take a class from Dr. Smith. He is extremely knowledgeable and  has a ton of experience. His class is immediately applicable. He is hilarious and he will challenge the way you think. I learned way more than I expected. He also offers some great insight. I wish all professors taught like he does.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2011<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a very stressful class but Professor Tim is a very funny guy and I learn a lot from him,just go to all the class and study the book and you will be good. you will become friends with your classmate very easy thanks to professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2011<br>Class Name: MKT798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tim's class is without a doubt one of the best and most useful classes I have ever taken at DePaul. I highly recommend Dr. Smith. If you ever have a chance to take his class, do NOT pass it up! This professor is extremely knowledgeable.... hey he wrote the textbook for the class! He is helpful too! He is lively and entertaining. His class flies by.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grade depends on midterm and final but they aren't that hard. We also had aplia homework but it's not a big part of the grade. Do it anyway, it really helps for the test. Smith is pretty cool and makes econ interesting and easy enough to understand. He is a little into himself but he has reason to be.. he's pretty BA.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2011<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Smith is a cool guy. He tries to make class interesting and throws some jokes around too. He is a funny teacher puts in a lot of effort and is very clear about what he wants. Class is pretty easy and there are 2 group papers and an individual one. He prepares you for everything you need to know. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2010<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher. I agree he is rude. Knows his stuff but knows very little about teaching. Book that he wrote for class is incomprehensible. Don't take this class unless you like staying after class is already completed an hour and a half ago. You end up rushing through labs and not learning anything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2010<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You're on your own in this class and not much help given by prof. Excel concepts are explained minimally and many students were lost and confused by lack of explaination. Class is scheduled to dismiss at 4:20pm, majority of students stayed in lab until about 5:30pm. Most stressful class I have taken at DePaul so far.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2010<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Resistance is futile with this guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2010<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stud.

He isn't a nice person though. I learned an incredible amount from the class. I'm taking 310 now and have done well thanks to what he taught me. Problem is- when it comes to grades he gives you a rubric and doesn't like to go by it. He liked me ALOT but ended up getting a B in his class because he expected alot from my papers</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I must begin by saying that Prof. Smith does know marketing research. However, this class is HEAVY on statistics and financial calculations. I found the assignments difficult since homework is based on SPSS software that you have to buy and install. If you are not strong in stats, math, or finance, avoid his class !!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting prof.  He knows a lot about marketing and market research.  80% of the class was group work - a term-long market research project and 3 write ups on Harvard Business Review cases.  20% was individual stats assignment.  He has a strange style of grading, but if you do the work this is a fairly easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smith is a strict textbook professor. You don't need to show up to understand what is in the book. This is fine by most students, but it isnt the reason I pay $400 a credit hour. His expectations of the class are very straightfwd. Tests are simply perversions of the practice tests available online. Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2005<br>Class Name: MKT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor I wish I could Take him for all my MKT classes</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Class, too bad that he is not going to be teaching his normal courses next qaurter, otherwise I would take him again! :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lot a work to get a B+.  Papers are straight forward.  Lots of reading assigned but not relevant to the quiz.  You must go to lecture and listen to his main points.  Quizes are usually 4 questions even though they corver 4-5 chapters of reading...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel I got the short end of the stick. I had never heard a review for this teacher & I wish I had. He's very arrogant & a hard grader. He gives no feedback on papers, but you'll never get a perfect score.
