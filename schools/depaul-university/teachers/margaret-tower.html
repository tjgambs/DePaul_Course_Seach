Her tests are difficult and she makes you read and study on your own. But, like she says this class will determine whether you are made for accounting or not. If you like accounting and you put in the work you can get an A+.  She also replaces your first quiz with midterm & midterm with final if better :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>This is a college course guys, get with it. I studied a normal amount, went to review sessions, and asked for help when i needed it and ended up with over 100% in the course. She's a great professor, ya you have to work for your grade but welcome to college. I would recommend her but don't expect and easy A. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: ACC250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well there was a lot of work and the requirements weren't always clear but the course really opens up your eyes to the world of accounting with many speeches by people in the industry and a mentor! Its a lot of work for a  credit class but good regardless. She's rigid but good, always open to meet students. She seems angry but deep down she's sweet</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2014<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes the exams very difficult and she's an extremely slow grader.

Don't expect an easy A, she makes you work for it but is very understanding and lenient with grading. My advice is to take her! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2014<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very rigid and the problems on her exams can be hard even if you do all the homework.

She is also fair when it comes to grades as she curves her tests and is easily reachable outside of class. I would absolutely recommend taking her. Just put in the work outside of class and everything will be good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2014<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She teaches very quickly. She doesn’t give you enough time to write everything down. The midterm and final were worth more than 100%. The other acc teachers who do this don’t make it count against you however she does. And if she knows you from a previous class bet your life she will be calling on you all the time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2014<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She doesn't teach the material at all!! she expects you to know how to do every chapter on your own and to teach yourself. she blames the students for doing bad just because she doesn't teach and is extremely rude!! avoid her at all costs, she makes her students write her a good review so ignore the comments suggesting to take her. class Avg 52%</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2013<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unless you are a wiz kid don't take this class.  She goes a million miles a minute. Class was terrible. She goes over hw problems forgetting people can't write as fast as she talks. Then she talks about certain procedures in the book like she expects you to know it already.   She knows her stuff but she is extremely ineffective as a teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really fair and helpful professor. Laughs at her own jokes, it's funny. Definitely take her for 102.

However, if you expect her to hold your hand you may as well not even show up. She is very clear about her expectations and is extraordinarily fair. If you want to learn accounting without the hand holding, take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2012<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful woman. Very knowledgeable. Extremely helpful if you ask for it, you must ask for it. Don't show up late, eat, or leave class early/bathroom you will get the death stare. She gives a lot of information in class but read the book do the problems and you will do great in the class. There are also 4 grades: 2 quizzes, midterm, and final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102H<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a kind person who is a good person to know outside of class for jobs. I wouldn't recommend not taking her but be warned sometimes you will be frustrated with her tangents. She would tell us every single type of long answer problems on the midterm and final which made the tests not that hard (because you knew exactly what to study)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seems to love the world of accounting, but her constant off-topic stories derail any ACC 102 learning.  Overall, very nice woman, but her business experience get in the way of her teaching the material that is tested.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: ACCTH102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows a lot about the accounting filed and has much experience in both the public and private sector...with that being said, just because you are good in the business world does not make you good at teaching. She often told the class before mine a lot of information regarding the final, midterm and paper and did not tell my class, not recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was not easy. yet she was a very good teacher. she curved almost all the test based on how the class performed and she was always willing to help. she went over problems that were going to be in the test, so there were no surprises. study hard and you would get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dissapointed. Midterm 35%; final 40% field trip,case study, and attendance 25%. She doesnt give out any extra credit, or curves. She's a serious teacher from the corporate world. Must study and do all the hw to do well in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2010<br>Class Name: ACC309H<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice lady. Very willing to help. Material is difficult and she covers a lot of it pretty quickly. She throws a number of curve balls at you on the tests but usually curves if the class doesnt perform. Review midterm multiple choice for final. Work hard and you will do fine. Not an easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof!! Helpful, understanding, knowledgable. Curves every test (Midterm & Final). Relatively easy compare to the other prof. teaching the subject. Notes are the key! She goes over the homework-solutions on bb. All homework problems that were solved on the board in class, were on the test as well! Easy points!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tower brings in alot of private sector experience to class, which is super helpful when you're teaching Accounting. The class is a total of 300 points: Midterm - 100, Case Study - 20 points, Fieldtrip to ACC Firm - 15, Final Exam - 120, Attendance - 15, Homework - 30. You're allowed 2 absences and the class is all around good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm so confused. My previous comment was deleted, and it contained no fowl language of or untruths. To surmise my deleted post, Mrs. Tower does not respect her students. During the final, after many students asked her questions about the poorly written exam, she exclaimed quite loudly &quot;I should have gotten a proctor!&quot; Please don't delete my post.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2009<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Couldn't agree with the two comment below any more.

Her teaching method: put HW answer key on projector & skim answer. Setup/solution techniques should be explained & walked through on chalkboard step by step; she attempted a few times w/much difficulty. Her checks for comprehension are insincere & she answers &#63;s with contempt. Group project w/external corp. was GREAT!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2008<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tower is really good. Unlike other dull and boring professors, Mrs. Tower was always making jokes and was interesting to listen to.
