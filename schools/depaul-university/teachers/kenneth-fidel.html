			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

His lectures do not coincide with sociology material, rather stories about his life that are not interesting whatsoever. 65% of the class was given a C for no clear reason. Absolutely pathetic.

I am aware not everyone is a fan of when teachers incorporate their personal experiences into the lectures and make you read on your own, but I didn't even buy the book and still passed easily.  Easy paper grader and a really knowledgeable guy.  Tests are a bit tricky though but he gives you definitions in class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really cute old man and I want to like him, but the class made that difficult. He rambles on, complaining about the "upper class", telling pointless stories about his Turkish wife and seems to forget where he is from time to time. Go to class, because the tests are vague, but the class is REALLY self-taught. Would not take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't recommend. If you can take someone else, do it. He doesn't use the book often, essay topics are vague, randomly changed our final from MC to in class essays. I missed one test, got a make up, was told it wasn't going to be full credit AFTER he graded it. Repeats boring stories and I got more from the book than attending class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIM. All he does is tell his life story and talk about the public school system and Turkey. If you ask a question or say something that he views as incorrect he will belittle you and make you feel dumb.

DO NOT RECOMMEND</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He talks about his life way too much and when he does decide to try and teach, we don't cover much. He spends 50 minutes on a paragraph in the text and leaves the rest for you to read on your own.

Uses single generic methods to lecture. Class is boring offers students little motivation to learn unless you're super interested in the subject. Paper topics are vague; sometimes have little relevance to the course. Self-taught class no point in attendance. Blah</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY, please. I was hoping for this class to be  a basic intro to sociology, but instead the class got an intro to his life...AND IT NEVER ENDED! To this day (7 weeks in) he talks about the same stories over and over. Credit is lost if you skip class, but even when you're there it is a complete waste of time. STAY AWAY! Horrible teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst professor I've had at DePaul.

He'll expect the same from his students like common courtesy, responsibility, and decency.

Here is his deal...#1 go to class and take notes. If you take notes you dont have to read or buy the book. #2 he will give you a study guide the class period before your midterm/final. The study guide will be a condensed version of your notes. He will then choose 3 questions for tests.

However, if nobody participates, then he will just keep lecturing on the topic.  Sure, his lectures are peppered with personal experiences, but he tries hard to make them relevant.

Half of every class is wasted on his stories (which really aren't very good). He just talks the whole time.
