	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

He claimed this was so we could have time to work on our "Your Turn To Teach" projects, which require us to do a presentation on a psych topic. No teaching happens here; just discussion.

Showing up to class was useless because you don't actually learn statistics. He just goes on and on about nothing and you do the HW based on the examples in the book. He means so well though.

If you don't like science, don't take this one. If you do, then this class is awesome. You learn a lot about the brain and other controversial theories about consciousness.

He's not a very traditional teacher - very little homework, very loose grading - but he genuinely wants to help you understand some very difficult concepts.
