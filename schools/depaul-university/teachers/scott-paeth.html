	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

We had 4 papers, pretty clear expectations and he was always willing to meet outside of class to help clarify anything. Good at connecting reading to discussions. Participation in discussions is a must and you have to do at least some of the reading so you can contribute. An understanding and helpful guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: REL251<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Paeth is a very intelligent guy, and makes many references throughout his lectures to help understand the material. Despite him being a very good teacher, he did assign our class three medium-sized essays and a research paper along with a good amount of reading. If this isn't too daunting to you I would highly recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: REL251<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOTS of work, but well worth it. This class is exactly what we should be going to college for -- regardless of the workload, he genuinely cares about the material and does his best to help you through it. Deeply intelligent (it's hard not to have an intellectual crush on him), kind, and funny. If you like learning and working for it, go with him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: REL229<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors DePaul has to offer.  Extremely intelligent man who cares about stimulating intelligent dialogue in his students.  Many of my friends who took this class maintain a personal connection with him.  One of my favorite professors by far.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's super passionate about what he teaches but don't take this class if you aren't willing to put in a lot of work. The readings are very intense and very long.

Be sure to stay on top of everything, attend class, and take lots of notes! I was dreading taking a religion class, the class discussions were awesome, and he's also funny, nice, and more than willing to help if you're lost. I highly suggest him, but stay motivated!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2012<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Paeth really is passionate about the subject. With that said, do not take his summer class if you are looking for a blow-off. Took it just to get the credit in and worked pretty hard for the grade. A lot of readings (I read this before taking the class too).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, a fountain of knowledge.

Prof. Paeth is very nice and interested in the subject matter. There is alot of reading, but most of the material is thought provoking. There are 2 short papers and 1 long one and thats it really, besides reading and attendence. Made me respect what he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2011<br>Class Name: REL273<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst professor yet. Do not take him unless you want to be buried under piles of books and spend the class listening to mindless discussions.

While there is a lot of reading for this class, it is not always required to participate in class. We did not always stay on topic but none-the-less learned a ton. No test. 2 short papers and 1 long. He gave several extra credit chances. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher.

A.) Doesn't talk about the reading in class B.) Expects you to read 7 books over 9 weeks C.) Requires attendance.

There are 3 papers: 2 small, 1 research (final), and weekly online postings. He's really interesting/smart, and as long as you ask the right questions he?ll stay on topic of the books. He does, however, bring up themes not presented in class that can be confusing.

I think this man is the king of books, if you visit his office they are literally every where. Needless to say, you'll do a good amount of reading. Thought this class would be about RELIGION and WAR but we've mostly just talked about War, and finally getting into religion in the second half of the quarter... overall an OK class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2010<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are a lot of books to read but as the prof says you don't need to read every single page. He's very well read and that makes discussions interesting. Participation is important and it doesn't have to relate to the readings so speak up. Ask for help on papers if you're confused. Proofread your work and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Paeth expects way too much reading.  There is little reason to read the books as the discussions rarely if ever have anything to do with the readings.  The class seems interesting.  But he always seems to have more important work to do than grade the papers.  I knew the grade for only one of my papers before the group project.  His grading is t</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT TEACHER!!! He does make you read a lot and depending on you class the discussions may go off topic, but having the discussions go off topic is the best part of the class. The readings are relevant to the course and he chooses them for a reason so do the readings. He's understand and will let you modify his essay assignments if you ask him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2009<br>Class Name: REL288<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher..The worst teacher I have ever taken at Depaul..He makes you read over 200 pages for class then doesn't even talk about the readings..Save yourself and don't take him..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Focal point seminar...extremely boring.

I don't know how he did it but maybe it was because he clearly knows what he is doing and i always thought religion is all about church stuff. And he's kinda hot too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2008<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is horrible..I don't know why he makes you come to class when he doesn't even talk about what the 200 pages he just made you read..He is boring and I didn't learn much in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2008<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Eventhough the professor is passionate about the subject, class gets Extreeeeemly boring. There's lots of talking, reading and writing. I am not kidding... You have to force yourself to write ljournals for each class and give your opinion.
