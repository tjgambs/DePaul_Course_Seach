I thought the class was going to be boring but she was able to keep me interested in the material. My only complaint would be that she rushed through the lecture slides too fast without giving students enough time to write especially since this was used for tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2012<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one the smartest and most amazing professors at DePaul. Very clear about what she expects, and is willing to work with you if a concept in unclear.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2012<br>Class Name: CNM103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher. Subject always interesting. Was initially dreading this class (8:00am Monday class), but she made it super fun. I literally started getting excited for Mondays. Easy grader. Weekly papers, a midterm, a final, and one final paper.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2011<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Steele is tough -- class is mandatory, grades fairly, and you need to study for tests .With that being said, I highly recommend her. She's a great COLLEGE professor.  What I look back and appreciate most is her ability to guide us to think critically about concepts learned and apply them to our lives and current issues.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2011<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Catherine is a very young, yet concise and professional instructor. She is always on top of her game and was never late to class. She has excellent clarity in her lectures. She also encouraged the class to debate on controversial issues, which became somewhat heated & interesting. She isn't the easiest grader, so remember to take good notes!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2011<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Steele is an awesome teacher. I easily got an A in the class by doing the work. She grades on a curve if I remember. She wants you to succeed but you do have to show up to class and take notes. Lots of pop culture references. She may SEEM unapproachable but she's actually just professional. I would definitely take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cat was pretty cool. Took her job pretty seriously. HATES when people are absent/late-Attendance a MUST both for a grade and notes. PP are not posted. expects you to read/Doesnt mention book in class much but expect it on the tests. weekly papers are annoying but engaging. class is easy but final paper is pretty dumb and way too difficult!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cat was pretty cool.

Very knowledgeable and good at making people think critically, if they are willing to think outside the box that we're conditioned for. Great prof. def take her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2011<br>Class Name: CMNCMN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Discussion papers every week. Pretty easy reading but gave random quizzes to make sure you did them. Really unapproachable rarely ever helped. DO NOT TAKE if you want a prof who cares.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2011<br>Class Name: COM103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class does entail you to work hard, but it's not impossible or over the top by any means. She's a great teacher and makes the class very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2010<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Catherine, overall, was an average professor.  She was neither amazing nor terrible.  In fact, I think she will be one of those professors I will most likely forget in five years.  However, the class was very easy if you did the readings, the discussion papers, and studied like CRAZY for the midterm and final.  Just show an interest in the subject!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Constant readings, a discussion paper due every week, rarely posts powerpoint slides so you have to take notes in every class. She was also quite standoffish and was unapproachable. Also a 6-8 page paper due along with an impossible midterm and final. DO NOT TAKE!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2010<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>for an intro class she was impossible. her tests suck! attendance is mandatory if you do not attend the class she will make you write a 2 page paper to get your points back. this class is awful do not take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2010<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked Catherine. She's really approachable and I felt like she cared about my work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very knowledgable on the topics brought up in class. Every class was a group project to present or a movie clip which keeps your attention. You must attend class and can't miss more than 3. She nice outside of class and treats students like adults. Don't take if your a lazy student. I enjoyed the class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2010<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm is an essay test. Final is basically a cumulative all short-answer test. She assigns an 8 page paper for a 100-level class. Almost all quarter she has been completely unapproachable until the last 2 weeks (at just about the same time that course evals came out... hmmmm....) I definitely would NOT recommend taking her for CMN 103</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2010<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very young and extremely knowledgeable on her topics. She has a difficult mid term but every day you attend class you get points that help you in the long run. A very interacting class which keeps everyone interested. If you like to learn and are a hard working student I would recommend this class.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
