I went to all but 2 or 3 classes and did all the assignments and then at the end of class he told me that class was mandatory when he said it wasn't in the syllabus and gave me a horrible grade he said was justified. I don't remember the section but it was the history of modern Europe.  Save yourself the trouble!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: HIST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think his class was great. He explained what he wanted from the papers to us twice. His structure and what he wanted from the papers was very clear. He had us practice on two short papers before doing a larger one. Whoever posted the previous comments must have been sleeping or disorgqainzed him/her self. One of the BEST prof. I have had here.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the most disorganized professor I've ever had in my life.  He assigns papers and then barely explains how he wants you to write them.  What a waste of tuition.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really easy teacher.  He has a good sense of humor.  He assigns so much reading material, but you don't actually have to read it...just read for your specific assignment.  Good class discussions...participate!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: HST220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great teacher.

The class consisted of a mid-term, take home final, and 10-12 page paper.  For the people who did not like his teaching style or comments in class should VOICE their opinion.  HE will not bite your head off.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2006<br>Class Name: HST220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Liberal or not, if you disagree, voice your opinion, he will respect you for that.

His class was very interesting and good grader.  Has a good sense of humor.  I was the enslaved individual at first, but then made it out of the cave to embrace the sunlight (Socrates).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2006<br>Class Name: HISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2006<br>Class Name: HST350<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the guy is totally, liberally biased.  He tried to argue that Palestinians should be labeled as patriots and not as terrorists.  His class was a breeze if you're willing to swallow completely left wing garbage without questioning him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want an easy history class, Professor Ceh is the way to go!  You only have to write 2 papers (2 pages each), and have a midterm and a final.  The midterm was kind of hard, but he curved it a lot!  The final was a breeze.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: HST200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is an awesome teacher . he inspired me to double major in history.  alot of teh history teachers are good, but he is amazing.  i ahd him a year and a half ago and he still talks to me every time he sees me even though slept in the few calsses i went to or i left early</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: HST20063<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, very intersting.
