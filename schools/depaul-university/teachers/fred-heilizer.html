He was laid back and his lectures were full of video clips. Despite the long class, it was not hard to stay awake. There were two multiple-choice tests, no homework and a GREAT curve. It's virtually impossible to get less than a C.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2005<br>Class Name: PSYCHOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has deep-seated issues and he will take them out on you. He wears five watches. He will not tollerate cell phones being turned off or pens being dropped. If you like the discomfort of listening to the dilusional ranting of a mental patient mixed with the structure of a kindergarten class with the stress of a mine field than take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: PSY351<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think,he is a good professor. I enjoy having him as a teacher. He is knowledgeable, and I leraned a lot in his class.True, sometimes the class is boring, but he is not mean or evil as other have said. Naturally, he just do not like you eating or disturbing the class!!! He grades &quot;very fairly&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought the class was interesting because it was about motorcycles and otherwise I would have not learned about them.  I loved the field trips, the in class movies, The Wild One and Evil Kanevil, and the book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainance.  It was straightforward and a good class to fulfill the requirement with.  I find him charming.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Maybe it wouldn't have been so difficult to get through this class if I didn't take it as a 3 hour night course.  Fred is kind of scary at first, but as time goes on, he tends to be an ok guy.  Grading is extremely fair from my experiences, due to the curve he gives on the exams.  The class can be funny at time, and extremely boring at most.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Consider ANY other professor. SERIOUSLY, god. I don't usually have a problem with professors, but anyone who trails off like he does, and ends with &quot;and stuff like that&quot; when he can't remember what he was just talking about should give up teaching. Freaking mumbles and treats you like a two year old. Awful, not even worth the easy grade!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2005<br>Class Name: PSY351<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the worst Professor I have ever had. If you have to take his class, do not take it at night. You will most likely fall asleep and then he will make you wish you were never born. Two people actually came close to tears because of him.

He should be fired!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2005<br>Class Name: PSY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an okay professor to take for psy. he isn't that bad if you have to leave the room.
