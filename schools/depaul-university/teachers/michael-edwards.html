The trips were amazing and this was the best honors class offering.  However, once our discover week was over the class was not as interesting.  Common hour was relatively slow, and our discussions did not require knowledge of the text to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>total waste of time, if he doesnt approve of  your not approving his tactics, your grades are DOA. He is not a nice man, actually. Went too far with conversation which was inappropriate. Buyers beware of the slant-talk   and that use,easy A has a different stand with him.... Horrible!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mike is a provocative and humorous professor who like others said, can tend to stray away from the subject occasionally. He's a great man but make sure to stay active and involved in class, otherwise you won't get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2010<br>Class Name: ISP211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing Professor! The class is somewhat scary on the first day just because it seems like there is a lot of work involved, but you quickly learn that it's actually a pretty easy class. Lot of reading, but more than half the class never read anyways. Easy and fun class overall. Got an easy A. He is an extremely interesting guy. Def recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2008<br>Class Name: PHL328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unbelievably brilliant prof. This is one of the few classes you can take at DePaul that really changes the way you examine and percieve the world. The purpose of his class is not to drll you on assignments, attendance etc. Instead, he wants you to walk away with a new insight. Hes easy going, fairly funny, and extremely understanding. Awesome Guy!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: PHL328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class with a great professor.

I liked the class because he made the topic interesting, throwing in jokes every now and then, and for the fact that class was so spontaneous.  It wasn't strictly organized, which is what made the class stand out.  I've learned significantlymore than a lot of the other courses I've taken at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2007<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very nice guy, funny, intelligent.  Class flew by, he posed many interesting questions.  Grades fairly and quickly. Would highly recommend, even though he's a bit out there and strays from the material every so often.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2007<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>class was very interesting - he went off on tangents a lot but those were usually interesting too - class a bit disorganized but good overall. nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class.  He sometimes gets distracted and can be pretty boring at times.  Funny guy though.  He takes attendence and it counts for a lot of your grade.  Reading the books isnt really necessary but it helps.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2006<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really cool guy who seems to care a lot about what he's teaching. I can't say I learned all that much from him but the readings and discussions opened up my mind to a lot of new ideas. I'd recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree that he's a very kind warm person (and funny too). When it comes to his teaching style, however, I have to say that it's a bit overrated. In my opinion, he didn't explain the material well. He did a great job, however, entertaining the class with his jokes. I personally wouldn't take him again. I've had better phl profs at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very cool teacher! He has the ability to change your outlook on life. Got me interested in Philosophy and reflecting on life. Very easy grader, interesting material, fun class periods. Gives a lot of short homework assignements, all pretty easy. No midterm, final paper. Take him, he rocks.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2006<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at DePaul- his class changed my perspective on what to do with my life.

I highly recommend him. He teaches the subject well. Daily quizzes a bit of a bummer but they were easy. Paper and final were quite easy if you paid attention to his class and his lectures. Take his class you won't regret it. Trust me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny Austrailian guy.

It kind of sucks but it's funny too. All the commerce kids refuse to want to learn philosophy. Edwards is AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.

I had him three times when I was at Barat, and trust me he'll make you feel stupid sometimes, because he is very smart, so never try to outsmart him because he'll slam you right in your face.

TAKE HIM! TAKE HIM! TAKE HIM! I recommended him to my friends! If you don't like philosophy, he'll get you interested! Class is easy, daily quizzes on reading, but he pretty much gives you the answers to the questions as he says that, so you always get 4/4 even 5/4! I would definitely take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Dr. Edwards when he was teaching at DePaul at Barat.  He is such an awesome teacher!!!  He is funny and very interesting.
