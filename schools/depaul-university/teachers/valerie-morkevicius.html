I'm taking another class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: PSC233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Morkevicius is one of the best teachers in the Political Science department. She is new there and her skills to teach are amazing. She really knows how to teach. And if you attend regularly, do the readings, and participate in class you should get an A. I highly recommend her.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
