You don't do anything in class but you have to go. We looked at pictures and talked about them for 2 class periods. Is also a really hard grader. She is also a grammer freak! Only take her if you're a really strong writer.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>MacKenna was a great teacher,but I found her to be challenging.I didnt receive one A on anything compared to receving all As in 103.Hard grader.She encourages you to be risky with what you write.She uses huge words that are hard to understand. If you're an awesome writer, take her.She's nice and fun</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is okay.  Takes absences personally and will take it out on your grade.  I never got anything below a B, but gave me a C+ on one thing...that mysteriously lowered my over all grade to a C+.  That's mathmatically impossible.  So make sure to attend every class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so great!
