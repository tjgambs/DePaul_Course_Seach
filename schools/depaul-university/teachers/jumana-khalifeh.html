You may want to bring a laptop, but it's not totally necessary, however a lot of info is online so I find it helps with note taking. The tests are awesome because she lets you know exactly what to study.

She can be unorganized and moves fast with lectures. Overall, she is a good and easy professor. If you are an obnoxious student you are not welcome in her class.

There is only one test (midterm) a group project and a final paper of 8 pages.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: 101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall she's an average professor.

She tells you to go to the reading reserve to find the reading but half the time it isn't even there, so she just tells you to catch up, which can be very cumbersome.

Let me explain why. First of all, she gives you too much busywork. The readings are easy but there are just too many of them. Second of all, many of the readings are in the E-reserve but most of the time the readings are nowhere to be found or the E-reserve site is down.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Acts as though her class is the most important one we are taking even though it is a sophomore seminar, does not provide adequate explanation for longer assignments on the syllabus or on D2L, easy grader but the class is a nuisance and material is extremely repetitive.
