Read!! he quizzes every class on the readings assigned. write down the questions from the quizzes and you'll do good on the midterm and final</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2015<br>Class Name: SOC394<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>These lectures, what can I say, one minute we are talking about the book, the next, I have no idea. The class itself is not something I would recommend. He is a nice fellow for sure, but is so dull, I am put to sleep every time. If you must take this class, it is not horrid, but if avoidable, you will have more fun elsewhere.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2015<br>Class Name: SOC394<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The texts are very detailed and if you don't remember particular quotes for the multiple choice midterm, you will not do well. Lectures are insanely boring and off track. He has awesome handwriting on the board- that's the best thing I can say about this fellow. Avoid at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2015<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher has been offensive from the first day of class. He has made off-the-cuff comments in class to the point where I and a friend of mine had to walk out. His readings are equally offensive. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. I have never been more offended by a class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2015<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Very unclear. Talks super quiet, and expects you to come closer instead of him talking louder. Most of the Explore Chicago class was spent roaming around random parts of Chicago that had NOTHING to do with our readings purpose of the class. He's also super disorganized.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2015<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>He is so unclear when lecturing about the topic for the day. I didn't pay attention throughout class because when he would lecture it was always off topic and made no sense. When it came to taking the tests I got a B+ and an A and I never paid attention to the lectures just read little bits of the books.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are unusual but very interesting and I find him pretty engaging. He's also very strict though, quiz every week. There's not a lot of assignments, but if you don't do the reading every week you will fail the class. I did the reading, didn't study for the final and still aced the test so basically if you read you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quiz every class, but this is the only thing in class that will feel slightly relevant to material. Practically no feedback on work. Very unclear about what to expect. "Test on everything we have learned so far" is not helping anyone. Neither are his dry ramblings that never seem to have a point to take away. Rely heavily on readings to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Barker is my favorite professor at Depaul hands down! He is great at what he does, very smart but kind of dry. I love the readings you do for this course. He tells great stories that relate to what we are learning, it's like having your grandpa tell you entertaining stories from the past! Take this class if you want to be amazing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2014<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher of all time. The exact opposite of helpful and definitely not just a waste of a time but a waste of money on the books. Horrible teacher, and just a weird guy who doesn't have a damn relevant thing to say. Not that I'm only angry about the time wasted but the ridiculous quizzes with irrelevant topics</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2013<br>Class Name: SOC214<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a waste of time. Quizzes every class and he asks the most insignificant details about the reading. No feedback on assignments. Ridiculous multiple choice midterm & final. He gets on huge tangents and all examples, videos, and readings are DECADES out of date. None of his materials were relevant, helpful, or current. Do not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are looking to learn anything about sociology, this class is not for you. To be frank, Prof. Barker is a terrible teacher. Every single class period is wasted discussing trivial, irrelevant topics. However, if you are looking for an easy A, just do the reading and you should be fine. This class was an immense disappointment.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2013<br>Class Name: SOC214<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For each class he gives a test based on the readings. Midterm and final had about 80 multiple choice questions which was a bit difficult because its hard to remember 6-7 chapters without a guideline or something to focus on. And so he curves both tests. He shows a lot of videos. And he is a big talker, he can talk your ear off to like death.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2013<br>Class Name: SOC220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took three classes with Prof. Barker- and he is the favorite professor I've had even through my PhD coursework. It's college- you should be expected to work hard, and he expects college level work. He is a bit odd, but brilliant and also wonderful outside of class. Any issues, just email- he is a reasonable person. He is fantastic.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2013<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him twice for two separate classes. i found the class easy. You have daily quizzes which is basically your attendance. Your midterm and final come exactly from your reading material. Just read, show up, and you will get an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had professor barker as a Freshman for Explore Chicago (Crime/Business/Politics in Chicago). BARKER WAS THE BEST!!! Class is nothing but field trips! You go to many cool places! Weekly reading assigned, but it's short and simple! Quiz each week. Midterm/final are doable. Final paper as well....super easy; you just write about memories. TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2012<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Barker is nice. He responds to e-mails quickly. I did not enjoy hunting him down for my grades, because he never gives them back. Come to class. Do the readings. There are daily quizzes. Put some effort in and you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2012<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is funny, and very interested in teaching, his methods are very different but he is very easy to fallow and understand.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2012<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This has been my favorite professor by far at depaul. I've taken several of his classes and it's the only class I've ever really enjoyed going to. He knows what he is talking about, shows interest, we have cool field trips like visiting prisons and jails, and he can be really funny. Love this professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2012<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barker is easily one of the easiest professors. ITS CALLED READING PEOPLE! If you do it, I guarantee you will get an A. Do the reading and pay attention. quit whining, and welcome to college.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: SOC214<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awww lol this professor is great! Hes very funny ( not humor) but how he teaches! Easy A paper wit no bibliography, easy daily quizzes& final that just for fyi: you mustt readd everything! He'll still curve it tho! Lol</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was literally the worst class I have ever taken. He gave no direction at all and no one in class ever paid attention because his lectures sucked. I retained no information that I needed for the tests from him. He lectures about things that had nothing to do with sociology. This class ruined my GPA. It was horrible! STAY AWAY!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my first class at DePaul and it was the worst thing I have every experienced. Noel Barker has no structure to his lecturing, no notes, no study guide. Daily quizzes, and you don't find out your grade until the day before the final. Worst class in the entire world!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2011<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I thought that this class was going to be boring, which I have to admit that it is at times, but his lectures are pretty interesting when you get the hang of it.  You have to take daily quizzes, but they are not that hard. I would take him if you wanted to get interested in to sociology.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2011<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class. Prof Barker is really boring but makes an effort in making class fun.You have to read because there are quizzes everyday. You could use your book because he is usually not paying attention.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2011<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures can be boring, but he's a funny guy who tries to keep it interesting. &quot;Quizzes&quot; everyday but you can use the book when hes not paying attention. Curved the midterm and the 1 paper in the class was easy, I would definitely recommend him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2011<br>Class Name: SOC207<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Police and Urban City with Professor Barker. He was a boring teacher. His voice is very monotone but he is an easy grader. He curves the test a lot. We watched a lot of videos in class. There is a 1 question quiz everyday from the readings...easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2011<br>Class Name: SOC214<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Noel is the best professor at DePaul. Make sure you read because there are daily quizzes about the readings BUT the readings are super interesting! You also have to write a 3pg paper (piece of cake)DO NOT stress out about the midterm and final, he curves them, trust me! Plus he's super knowlegable. A bit boring sometimes but funny guy. take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2011<br>Class Name: SOC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Greatest teacher at DePaul.

He is funny and interesting. Daily quizzes for attendance and to ensure you read the assigned material. Easy paper. One of the best at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2010<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher. He just stands up there and talks to himself, wincing as tho he has heartburn. Dont sit in the back or you wont be able to hear him. His daily quizzes ask very specific questions from the readings. However, he does have a curve so as long as you get half the questions right, you should have at least a C.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gives quizzes every day which are ridiculous. Lectures are sometimes funny, but offensive. Easy paper. Midterm and final are short answer and mult choice that are super hard. Didn't learn anything and you read 70pgs to remember one statistic. stupid</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2010<br>Class Name: SOC394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor! Easy A! Okay sometimes he can be a little bit boring, but if you participate in class it won't be. The books he picks are good reads. 25hrs of service learning is easy! If you have the option of picking Central States SER, pick the 76th and Kostner location. One question quizzes (super easy!)is his way of taking attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2010<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teerrrrrriblllllee!!!!! he is the worst. my whole class scored terribly on every quiz we took. yes, he curves them, but if u want better than a C in the class GOODLUCK. dont do it he is boring too!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2010<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a fantastic teacher, very passionate about his subject and seemed to have a wealth of experience to draw from in lectures. While at first the class drags it is certainly made up for when he gets into the topics he's interested in. A must have for any sociology majors.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2009<br>Class Name: SOC221<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely the worst professor I have had at DePaul.  No basis in sociological theory - we watch videos all the  time.  15 quizzes and a mid-term so far and we have received nothing back - almost the end of the quarter.  Boring, uninteresting, a waster of time as well as frustrating for someone who takes school seriously. Don't waste your tuition!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2009<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Barker is great. His lectures can be a bit boring, but most of the time he keeps students engaged with funny/interesting stories and facts. He knows his stuff. Daily quizzes on assigned reading, but they're multiple choice..pretty easy. As long as you pay attention to lectures and read, you'll do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2009<br>Class Name: SOC394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Barker is great. Sometimes is hard to pay attention to, he rambles a little. He's a great teacher, he assigns great and intriguing reading. I learned a lot and it was an easy class. 1 question quizzes daily but midterm, final and serice hours were easy. Great class-DEFINITELY take it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting guy. Even though he's old, he can connect to students our age. Funny anecdotes from his life keep the class interesting. EASY quiz everyday. You only need to get a few right to get an A on them, so guessing totally works.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2009<br>Class Name: SOC314<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome guy with a lot knowledge and the proper skills to teach effectively.

Sometimes, lectures could be boring. MAKE SURE THAT YOU READ THE CHAPTER BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE A QUIZ EVERYDAY. CLASS ATTENDANCE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE SOMETIMES ON MIDTERM/FINALS HE WOULD ASK ABOUT A LECTURE. ONE FIVE PAGE PAPER (EASY). HE ALSO, GIVES YOU A WRITTEN ESSAY PART BUT GIVES YOU THE QUESTIONS ONE WEE</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2009<br>Class Name: SOC214<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very easy teacher.

I am a straight A student who got a C+ in this class! The books were interesting, but lecture was extremely mind numbing. He picks random facts from the three books and that is the midterm/final. No study guide, no pre-test prep, just random facts, like &quot;What color were Gina's socks when she went to sleep&#63;&quot;.  Don't do it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: SOC201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barker is my favorite Soc professor. He is crystal clear on what he expects and follows the syllabus exactly. The classes are 100% lecture, but it's all relative to class and it's very intersting. He makes great examples that can relate to everybody. Quiz every day, but you only need to answer one question-out of eight.

I CANNOT STRESS THAT ENOUGH.

However, I think he is way too focused on the lecture aspect of his classes. Even though I actually enjoyed the readings, we had one for every class and daily quizzes based on them.

He goes off topic WAY TOO MUCH! The class was about Police and the Urban Community, and then he makes us watch Romeo and Juliet. He knows his stuff, class is easy, but expect lectures to be boring, useless and pointless. Oh, and attendance is very important, so show up!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2007<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All he does is talk about random stuff that makes no sense. His classes are usually easy just do the reading and you should be fine.  He also does the same thing for every class he teaches so if you have a friend in the same class but a different time chances are he did the exact same thing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very nice guy, but class was a waste of time. I hated reading the material, only to go to class to hear him tell me what I just read. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm here to work and read,; the teacher should be here to challenge me and make me think about what I read, not waste my time. Very lenient with grades.

Make sure you participate because that gives you an edge if he knows you.  Daily quizzes are not that bad.  If you have a demanding schedule and would have problems reading everything then you might want to reconsider because you do have to read a lot.

He is old, but truly knows the minds and attitudes of college peeps.  Recomended.  This class was half interesting, half forgettable and half boring.

Very funny and interesting. Worth going to class. A little slow on getting papers/tests back (up to weeks after you took the tests) and you never get quizzes back.
