			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Buy Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />

The class I took was online once a week with homework, tests and quizzes online. The online system is great and it helps students solve things they didn't get. I didn't learn a lot in lectures but that's okay because I did okay. Good class for kids who don't like math </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chin is completely all over the place in his lecture. He just relies on mymathlab and that I ended up teaching the material myself. I wouldn't say he doesn't teach, but he doesn't know how to teach clearly.

Very confusing and hard to follow him. Gives unclear answers-at best- when you do ask a question. The book and tutoring center saved me. Quizzes every week, mostly in MyLabsPlus but some in class. Final  worth 36% and midterm 27% sucked. Jumped through hoops to barely earn a B.

If you are decent with logic problems and probability you will have no problem earning an A.  If you are not very math oriented however he will not waste time catching you up.

He moves through the material way to fast and never explains. He expects you to understand what he is saying and never answers questions correctly or just makes you feel stupid for asking.
