Irresponsible Professor! The class grade is Attendance, Midterm and Final. He does not give up clear concept on the lectures, nor guideline for you to study. After midterm he left the country for three weeks. . This is the class that you paid money to study your butt off by your own.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: MKT545<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the only class i have never dreaded coming to. We were never there longer than an hour and 45 minutes but still got through the material. He didn't waste time with busy work and gave great examples in lectures that helped you remember the concepts. I wish he taught more classes I needed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2014<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Full of good real life examples.

While he can be very sarcastic, blunt, and unclear at times, if you are professional and willing to work hard, he is very helpful and easy going. Great stories and good sense of humor. The accent makes it better! Would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2014<br>Class Name: MKT545<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HIS LECTURE IS EXTREMELY BORING AND GRADE POORLY!!!!!

His powerpoints came straight from the textbook & just spends class reading them BUT adds really good life examples. No need for the textbook in my opinion, its common sense. posts power points. gets distracted during lecture. Havn't actually learned anything, easy class though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2013<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Among the worst at DePaul.

There's 3 of them so make sure you study. But he curved every test because it was unclear what to really study. But overall, he's funny, easy, gives real life examples. I would recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2012<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does a great job of keeping the class interesting and applies real life examples to drive the point home. Great sense of humor and extremely knowledgeable. One of the best classes I have taken at DePaul. Exams and readings are easy. You are pretty much guaranteed an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2011<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got an A. I spent about 4 hours each week reading the chapters and taking thorough notes BEFORE class. I studied unbelievably hard and went to every class and wrote down every word he said. He does not care about his students nor does he make it easy. 2 exams (30% of grade) 1 final (35% of grade). multiple choice and essay. GOOD LUCK its not fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2011<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is 30% teaching & 70% stories filled with his personal opinions.That said, the class is bearable. If you've got to take him for MKT555 my advice is to take detailed notes on the few clear concepts he actually teaches each class. Copy his examples then use them on the take home final. Did this & got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2011<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Laziest professor at DePaul. Plays favorites (any student of eastern european descent), writes horrible exams. Don't test youself thinking your brave. I did that and it cost me. Studied countless hours, he doesnt say whats going to be covered on any exam. DePaul should fire him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2011<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grade was based off of two tests. 35% of each exam was written and graded subjectively. Class let out early every class, to then not go over material covered on exams.  Power points were straight from the text we had just read. Examples made zero sense. This guys accent is the least of his problems as an educator. One of the worst at DePaul. Avoid!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class itself is interesting. Gives us life examples all day and we always gets out early. Your grade is only the midterm and final. Doesn't tell you anything about it and weighs the essays too much and grades very subjectively. I felt I aced the final & don't know why I got a C in the class. AVOID.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2011<br>Class Name: MKT545<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures were interesting and quick.  We were never there longer than two hours.  Grades are strictly based on test scores and &quot;participation.&quot;  I never spoke up, but I did well on the tests, showed up, and got an A.  If you enjoy essay tests and pay attention, you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2010<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is likeable, a bit hard to understand through thick accent. His examples are dated and only revolve around cars. Butif you pay attention, and act likeable, you can get through it. He tests on examples given in class. The paper was NOT on marketing which is hilarious because I thought this was a marketing class. The paper was difficu</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2010<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Foreign accent makes him a little difficult to understand, but overall he is very intelligent. He gives good real world examples and cracks a decent joke now and then. He tests straight from his lectures so go to class and you will do well. Book not really needed, but can be helpful for studying.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2010<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE'S A GOOD PROFESSOR.

I did learn a lot from him especially from his own experience. The companies' visit are all interesting and fun. You can pick your own paper topic to write about. It is an easy and enjoyable class I have ever take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2010<br>Class Name: MKT545<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I personally felt that Dr. Chadraba was a great teacher.  However, some students like him while others do not.  Bottom line, to get an A in his class, attend every lecture and pay attention to his &quot;real-life&quot; examples because they will almost always be on the exam.  Finally, ask questions in class because his answers outside of class are pretty vag</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2010<br>Class Name: MKTG555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>no interest to get content across, no preparation, just reads from slides which are copied from the book!dead boring</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2010<br>Class Name: MKT545<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Completely agree with the comments regarding his stereotypes and ancient examples.   However, I would recommend writing down the stereotypical and ancient examples because that's what he tests (all essay midterm and final) on eventhough the class notes (directly from the book) may say something completely different.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2009<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If youre going to spend this type of money on education you will not get your dollars worth.

If not, don't. Participation is required but 1 or 2 comments a class get you a good mark. Many ppl do poorly because they are not prepared for essay exams.

Decent professor, knowledgeable and mildly entertaining.  Do NOT miss class or show up late.  Take notes on everything he says or writes on the board.  Read and study the cases closely.
