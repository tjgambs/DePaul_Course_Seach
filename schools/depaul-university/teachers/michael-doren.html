He gives too much hw but the points you get for those assignments help you to get a better grade if you try well enough. His tests are long but most of the problems are from hw assignments. I would recommend him to the future students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2009<br>Class Name: BMS135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Doren is an interesting man, that being said he is probebly the most helpful/caring professors in academia.  Do not sluf off on homework, there is way too much to get behind. His tests are serious business, but not impossible, and he is always there to lend a helping hand. I highly recomend him to future DePaul students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2009<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I personally do not like his class. I found his class to be extremely easy and very boring. Do not take this class if you have already taken calculus before. He gives a lot of homework!!! His directions are confusing. He's a nice man though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Doren is such a nice old man. He really cares about his students & tries his hardest to give you a good grade. Hw is a MUST-- he does assign a lot but it really helps you in the end. even counts on tests (if it is to your benefit) Lots of extra credit opportunities. I loved him & got an A...worked hard tho. No quizzes. 3 tests plus final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher...At first, I was worried because he assigns a lot of homework and writes out all the assignments by hand. But then I realized how lucky I was to have signed up for him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the worst and most ignorant teacher I have ever had in my life. He is extremely arrogant and will not help you when you ask for it. On my homework instead of offering help he put &quot;why are you still enrolled in this class&#63;&quot; Be prepared to do a ton of homework that is GRADED on top of hard tests. Good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2007<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>prof. doren is an amazing teacher. he is so cute and super helpful. he teaches so that every one knows whats happening and gives numerous oppurtunities throughout the quarter for tons of extra credit. he really goes the extra mile to know that everyone understands the material. its an easy class if you do the homework and study for exams.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2007<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome guy. Cool T-shirts and sandals. Always willing to help in office. Pretty clear. Subject matter is easy if you pay attention and go to class. Lots of extra credit opportunities. Take him and you shouldn't do worse than a C.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2007<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Doren is a great teacher (& funny!). Whatever you need from him, he will be at your service. Sends lots of emails, watch your inbox for extra-credit. Assigns homework every night but that is expected in Math class. Do the homework and you will be cool for the Exams, in which there are only 3</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a nice guy! His class was hard work but do your homework and you're set. You can email him with questions and he always responds very quickly. He is partly retired so he only teaches a few classes...BUT YOU SHOULD TRY TO GET IN ONE OF THEM!  I got an A in the class and I never could have with out him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2007<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So far Professor Doren's class is amazing! I'm the type of person that loves math when it is thought great and right now I feel like I'm finally understanding Mat 130!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best math teachers at DePaul, but you have to work for a good grade. There is A LOT of hw, but he takes you step-by-step and you can email him with any questions. Tests are not bad, but study. He wants you to understand the material, not just memorize formulas</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sweetest little old man ever. You can tell he loves math and tries to get his students to understand it. He's a fun teacher who does assign a lot of hw but most math profs do. Allows test retakes and E.C. and for the most part his test are based off hw probs. Take him for any math classes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a wonderful teacher! He CARES about his students and he is willing to help them anytime, anywhere. Very enthusiastic about math and he explains things step by step. He has a passion for TEACHING! TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Explains things very nicely. Expect a lot of homework. Shoot yourself when it comes to an exam, people stay up to an HOUR after the test to finish it. everything you learn in class IS NOT ON THE TEST!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! I passed his class with a C and I had to pray for a miricale for that.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE WAS THE BEST TEACHER I HAD THIS QUARTER. THERE IS HOMEWORK EVERYDAY BUT HE IS MORE THAN WELCOME TO HELP YOU THROUGH IT. SEND HIM AN E-MAIL AND HE WILL GET RIGHT BACK TO YOU WITH AN ANSWER. HE GIVES LOTS OF EC AND TESTS ARE NOT THAT BAD. WHATEVER YOU GET WRONG YOU ARE ABLE TO CORRECT FOR A PORTION OF THE POINTS. TAKE HIM HES AWESOME!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sweats profecusiously and wears hilarious shirts. Other than that hes an insanly nice man. Hw points all go towns tests, 3 and then a final. He really cares about the class and writes many emails. Tends to give brief examples in class and then test on MUCH harder ones. Stay on good terms with him and go to the TUTOR alot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome professor. assigns a lot of homework, but it's actually helpful. he is REALLY nice, and ALWAYS offers extra help. truly cares about his students, and wants everyone to understand the material. i highly highly highly recommend him, one of the best professors i have ever had. oh and offers tons of extra credit!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very nice guy and I think all the comments on him are very accurate. Read your emails! (he loves to send them)  Overall, he won't go over too much of the homework so be sure to bring problems up in class.  He gives a lot of homework, but as long as you turn it in you'll be fine.  Test grade averages with homework and extra credit(advantage!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Doren cares a lot about his students and gives people so many breaks--almost too many. Isn't concise on assignments, lectures, or tests...sometimes makes things more complicated and wordy. I don't see how you could not get an A from him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i cant imagine what the bms student below me is talking about.  test questions are the same as the ones we did on homework, and prof doren is the most helpful professor ever.  he's not easy and assignments are certainly long, but no one can teach you more about math than he does.  and he is nice, nice, nice</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2005<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best math prof ever.He goes over h.w. in class everyday & emails almost daily. Gives E.Credit in emails and hidden in h.w. assign. He helped me go from a D~B+. Show up. He'll know u by name sooner or later.TOO MUCH H.W. EVERYNITE THOUGH.Ask 4 help in person/email.

Corrections accepted though! :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: MATH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best math teacher I have ever had.He is very nice and very helpful.He explains the material VERY WELL!!I recommend him to many people and I will take him again for another math class.Go to class and you will do fine.He likes when students go to class.He even helps with homework over email.He is GREAT!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So the class is easy until you get to the test. His tests are impossible because they're not written like any homework questions from the book.

Also he does give out a lot of extra credit, and can use a cheat sheet for the final. I would take him for all of your math classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is the best math teacher I'v  ever had.
