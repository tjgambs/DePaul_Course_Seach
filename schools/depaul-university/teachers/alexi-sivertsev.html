It was more of a history class with one topic. Tests are super hard but he gives you two chances, including the final. Assigns 3 three-page papers and only gives two days to do the discussions. Chapters are very long and take forever to read. Very picky grader. Expect to work hard for a decent grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2012<br>Class Name: REL109<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the online section, and it was just alright. You have to watch several lecturettes a week, read 20-40 pages from the text a week, take a weekly quiz, and post a weekly discussion response, while responding to two other students discussion.

Overall, this class was a lot of work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: REL109<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sivertsev is a wonderful professor! Sure, his lectures are lengthy, but it isn't easy providing students with a full history of Judaism in just 10 weeks. He is an extremely intelligent and interesting person.
