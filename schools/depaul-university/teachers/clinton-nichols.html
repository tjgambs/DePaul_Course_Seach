It didn't really have one topic of Chicago. I would take something else if I were you. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2014<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hes a sweet man but this class was so stressful ugh and i don't know what its about to this day </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2011<br>Class Name: SOC212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very laid back.

However, his class was a serious pain in my you-know-what. For a discover class on a subject I love (photography), I thought I would enjoy every day. However, Clinton's class was barely about photography. The papers were very difficult and he grades hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2010<br>Class Name: SOC212<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree the work load is a pain. His class was very unorganized at times. plus there was a second mid-term on the 9th week of school ugh! including a final group project</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2009<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I guess he was okay I mean.  At least I passed, I pretty much took the class to get more credit before I entered the University.  The clips he had were cool, but to some extent his quiz and work load was a pain.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would take him again. He is very down to earth and he doesn't take attendance, but its a night class, so going actually helps. Classes were somewhat easy and all the quizes are online so you can use your book; plus you take like 10 quizes and he only counts the best 5!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
