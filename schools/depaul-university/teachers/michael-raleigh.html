The class was an easy A. Readings were super easy and you could get by without actually doing them. He expects people to participate but won't treat you any differently if you don't. He is extremely knowledgeable and grades easy. He was super nice and helpful. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Although the class itself was boring, Professor Raleigh is one of the smartest professors i have ever had. This man knows a lot, and is quiet about it unless you get to know him. Looked forward to his class because he always had interesting stories and a plethora of information to share. He has a dry sense of humor, and cracks jokes often. Take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2014<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Raleigh is engaging, helpful, and incredibly knowledgable in his field. His enthusiasm is refreshing and he made me want to do my best in the class, even though I was only taking it for the requirement. I highly recommend this class to anyone and everyone!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2014<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor who is willing to help you out if you need it. Definitely recommend him. The assignments aren't impossible, but be prepared to work a little bit on reading, writing, and analyzing skills. Would recommend this class to freshman as it is a great introductory course for college writing!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>We read a lot for this class, but it was not exciting discussion. I am not sure if that was him or the class, but I was expecting more. He expects high quality writing. I felt kind of dumb in the class because there were a lot of people that were really into literature, more than myself.  Find a different teacher, ask honors friends.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2014<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Great reading selection. Quizzes are fair. Professor is accessible outside of class. He has gone out of his way to help me and he's a really nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2012<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. He's extremely knowledgeable about a lot of different things, but sometimes he gets off topic because of it. This class is based on the readings, there is a decent amount of writing, and his quizzes are relatively easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor! Made the subject matter in an otherwise very dry class a lot more interesting. He incorporated a lot of interesting history and gives a lot of feedback on your writing. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher but very critical towards writing because he writes books and whatnot. But, overall a decent teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is easy but the Professor can be kind of condescending, and brings his political views into class a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher ever! So fun and qualified. Knows a lot about his area of teaching. DePaul Alum. Always makes class interesting with his random trivia and history. Very charismatic and funny. You will never be bored!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Raleigh is awesome. Interesting lectures. A really smart guy, knows a lot of random trivia. The class wasn't too difficult, just use the writing mechanics the textbook teaches and you should get an A. Take Raleigh for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Raleigh, Was a good guy. he was a hard grader. and sometimes unclear on his feedback. but with that a side he has a lot of knowledge on History. he told me that you could tie everything to history I found this very cool. he was one class short of a history major. not a bad prof!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely plays favorites. I did all of my assignments, which he said were crucial to our grade...only to find out that a kid in the same class only turned in papers...the kid got an A, I got a B. He also manages to bring up the most irrelevant information every class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool guy, i was really dreading this class but he really knows his stuff. Ties history into his lectures which keeps you interested. Gives good feedback on papers and is always available by email.He made a potentially boring class a lot of fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome guy. very understanding! more like a history class than an english/writing class though. either way, very easy and interesting class. he is hilarious too!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
