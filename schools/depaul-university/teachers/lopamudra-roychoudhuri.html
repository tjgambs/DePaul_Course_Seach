Also a good teacher. She gets very impatient when you ask her questions though. Not in a mean way though. She just gets irritated when you don't get it</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2012<br>Class Name: TDC463<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid.

Home-works are quite hard but doable.You would really learn about sub-netting and many more.Clarity is excellent.Her concepts are so cleared and must say very very very helpful and fair grader.Must take TDC 463 with her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2011<br>Class Name: CPSC445<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have an incredibly difficult time understanding the teacher's accent and speaks way to fast.  She also has an annoying habit of not informing the class of assignments until the day they are due or even the day after.  She also likes to assign projects on days that we do not have class and then make them due at midnight the same day.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2009<br>Class Name: TDC463<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very caring teacher who really wants everyone to succeed.  Though she was a bit fast, she would slow down at times to make sure you could catch up.  An extremely fair grader and I understand IP subnetting extremely well because of her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's extremly excited and enthusastic all the time. She takes pride in students extracurricular achievements. She is an easy professor, and you can get by with an A without really trying that much. I'd take her again for an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2009<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decent prof., kept us for full amount of time for a night class, CONSTANT GROUP WORK, stupid activities, very easy grader, class gets quite annoying after about week 4, if you want an easy A take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2009<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a fairly easy grader and is always in a good mood.  She really knows her subject.  If you are a lazy student, you could sit there and get a decent grade, but you will not learn unless you participate.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2008<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although an easy teacher, you really do not learn anything in this class. An easy A, but don't expect to come out of the class knowing how to computer program.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2007<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendance is not mandatory, but very helpful. She is, however, a very easy grader. As long as you show your work she will give you points for something. I had to miss almost a third of all the classes, and thought I would have to drop. But somehow I still managed to get a good grade. Just show your work!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2007<br>Class Name: TDC463<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't think she teaches - she just reads the book's slides. The homework was not sufficient to prepare for the exams. Class average for the midterm was a 70. I spent a lot of time reviewing the material she said to, but I barely recognized any of the material on the midterm. Too much low level material without much pratical application</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2007<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was very easy. I would do homework in class while she was lecturing. The final project takes a lot of time however she is a very easy grader. Midterm and final were fairly easy if you study. If students needed help on homework she would pretty much show everyone in class exactly how to do it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2006<br>Class Name: TDC368<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was challenging but Lopa was great.  Extremely helpful if you make an effort.  Very easy grader as well.  Would definitely take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: TDC368<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was extremely helpful.  This could have been a much harder class, but she took a lot of extra class time to help the slower students.  Very liberal grader!  Make an effort and you'll get an A.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
