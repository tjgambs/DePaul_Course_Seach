	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Buy Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />

Not at all boring for a 3-hours class. Makes a lot of jokes, gives music breaks and very clear study guide. Would take again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really hilarious! But, took him as a night class which was a mistake, lectures were too long for me to keep interest. Grade was based off of only 3 tests, which was really challenging for me. Also SO MUCH READING. I like him and I like psych but I didn't care for his course. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2015<br>Class Name: 347<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>just great - wish I took more with him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2014<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Ferrari is really knowledgeable and helpful. His class is both interesting and entertaining, he engages his students immediately. He knows what he's talking about and wants everyone to learn something and be able to take something away from his class. I will take him again if I have the opportunity.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2013<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. J is FANTASTIC! His intro course is great (and easy: 3 exams, no hw/papers) and he is literally the funniest professor in the department I've had so far. He starts class off with fun facts and keeps your attention going all class. Take him for social psych too!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2012<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. J is great! Many people don't like him but he keeps class interesting. I will definitely be taking his 347 class. The tests are easy if you pay attention and go over the notes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2012<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is interesting and he's entertaining (had him for night class), but he is a very egotistical man that talks about himself more often than not. He's not the clearest at explaining everything, so def get the book to read before exams as an aid to better understand the topics. Some ?s on exams are from text. Doesn't post slides so go to classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is extremely entertaining. He teaches everything on a personal and funny level. He is the best professor in the psych department. The tests are easy and straightforward. He wants the students to get something out of lecture more than tests. Retakes are a yes. No book needed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2012<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Favorite teacher at DePaul.  Keeps class involved and interesting so it's a great morning class.  Tests are of course based on the readings in the text book.  There are three, each with one short answer, but he gives you the topics before the test.   Very passionate and knowledgeable in his area of study.  TAKE IT.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2012<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best professors ever! Very interesting class! He makes an 8am class bearable. He has many funny stories that relates back to the material learned in class! I would definitely take his class again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2012<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. J is a great professor. Very energetic, knowledgeable, and hilarious. He is passionate about teaching and you'll learn a lot from him if you pay attention. Although the only grades in the class are from tests, he offers retake days. Be sure to study, as your grade relies only on 3 tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a person he is great. He is super passionate and fun to watch. Makes class very interesting. That being said, his grade does not reflect your knowledge of the material. He only does three exam (NOTHING ELSE). So it may not be right for everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: PSYCH105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ferrari is very passionate about psychology and makes lectures fun. IF YOU DON'T LIKE EXAMS, or you are a &quot;bad test taker&quot;. DO NOT take him. You're entire grade is made up of only 3 exams. No projects, no papers, just exams. However, he lets you retake exams 1 and 2. His outlines for exams somewhat inaccurate, which annoyed me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2011<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, is very helpful if you can get a hold of him. You must have a high level of humor for the class, but it makes the time you spend there more enjoyable. He means no harm if he makes a bad joke! Study, attend, engage and succeed!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2010<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really exciting to listen to, people that don't like him just don't cuz he is controversial (honest).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2010<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned so much from him! He has so much energy and enthusiasm about psychology, and he's hilarious, so he's perfect to take for an early morning or night class! He gives you the option of re-taking either or both of the first two tests. I think that's awesome! He can be hard to get ahold of outside of class or if you need help, though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2010<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST PROFESSOR I'VE EVER HAD! Dr. Ferrari is full of energy, extremely hilarious, very knowledgable about the world of psychology, and can grab and hold your attention in the classroom. Some people might take his humor the wrong way, but overall he is an awesome professor and if you get the chance to take him, do it! You won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very knowledgable about what he's talking about and has a lot of experience in the field, but he can sometimes come across a bit arrogant, intimidating, and insensitive. No homework or papers though, just three tests, which is nice unless you aren't a good test taker. He lets you re-take the first two if needed though, not bad overall.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2010<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm in this class and don't find him saying nasty things - He's funny! He reaches out to all the students, and he covers interesting topics. I never understand it from students, if you don't like a professor == drop the class!  why stay in it and complain&#63;&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2010<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so annoying! this class put me in a bad mood every day. and he makes sexual jokes that make me uncomfortable</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2010<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>just horrible, DO NOT TAKE</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2010<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, made me chose PSY as my major. He sometimes gets a little arrogant but that's becuase he rally knows what he's talking about. Only 3 quizes, no homework or papers. Quizes are pretty easy if you pay attention adn study, and he lets you retake the first two if you want. Great class really interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2009<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very encouraging and keeps the class interested. Basically, you just need to GO TO CLASS and pay attention while you're there to do well. His lectures are important when it comes to tests. Plus, he REALLY doesn't like when people miss a lot of classes or often come late. He might single you out if you do that.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2009<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am finishing this class in a couple of weeks, and I will miss it. It was hard getting up at 8am, but Dr J's morning 'welcome' and his wonderful enthusiasm for psych and for US made it worthwhile.  I highly recommend this instructor, and plan to take more Psych classes from him. He rocks!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2009<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As long as you go and get the lecture notes you should be fine. He tries to make lots of jokes but is really bad at it, and he's kinda of an ass. The class is intersting though and he keeps your entertained.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2009<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Dr J's class this summer; wow - amazing prof.  funny but educational.  he made us laugh at ourselves and life as we learned the material. this is the way all profs should be, and he is someone you should take for PSY at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2009<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for 105 [Intro 1], 106 [Intro 2], now 347 [Social Psy]. I would take all my psych classes with him. He is funny, informative, kind, and makes you think.  He cares if you learn. I did not get all As; that is not why I am in college. Dr Ferrari is one of the best Psych profs at DePaul -- at least that is what the majors all say.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2009<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ONE OF THE WORST PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSORS AT DEPAUL THE PEOPLE THAT GAVE HIM GOOD FEEDBACK GOT A GOOD GRADE BECAUSE THEY KISSED HIS ASS AS SOON AS HE COMES IN THE DOOR, NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR TEST RESULTS. HORRIBLE PROFESSOR</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: PSYCH106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just finished the 2nd class with him. Maybe bec I am an adult student I find him amazing. He is informative, engaging, and approachable.  Great sense of humor and NOT easy. NEVER found him 'to lie.' What is that about&#63;  Take and make your own opinion is my view.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2009<br>Class Name: PSYCH105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an arrogant windbag. He doesn't listen or answer students' questions and dismisses any information that contradicts or conflicts with his own opinion.  Frequently lies to class about test materials. Didn't matter when information was presented proving that he lied to his students about the contents of the final because of his tenure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2009<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible. He is often rated well, especially by Intro students because they simply don't know  what he says is BS. He believes it and if you didn't know any better why would you question a tenured teacher. There is a reason why no one in the Psych department wants to be associated with him. He is easy but if you take him keep your BS meter on high.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>person who HATES class == why are you still in it&#63;  you are half way through it, so why didn't you drop after the first or second class instead of staying so long - if his jokes are so bad.  I think he gives real world examples, with real world application, with real world funny comments.  What world are you from! :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>seems like someone did not study!  my friends and I who prepared from the guides he gave us did well.  hmmmm, maybe you need some help in college&#63;&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2009<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take, he is horrible, stupid jokes throughout class that are not funny, can't believe he has tenure</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2009<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>tests are difficult, and not like the book material, Tricky questions on test</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2009<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best professor ever, seriously</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2008<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow - previous person must not have done well!

Funny, makes an 8:30 class seem not so horrible. Tests are pretty easy, but even if you do badly on them you can retake the first 2.

Take him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ferrari is an awesome man. Personally, if I can get by without wasting my time going to class to listen to someone who's only going to talk about what I already read, I will. But even after reading everything in his class, I looked forward to Social Psych. Dr. Ferrari is worth every second you have.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2005<br>Class Name: PSY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is soooooo funny, definately worth taking.
