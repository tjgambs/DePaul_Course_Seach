Prof is smart and keeps class moving. I would definitely take her class again. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2011<br>Class Name: LST307<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely one of the worst professors I've ever had. She requires you to know as much as the author about each article. In addition to this, she has the tendency to play favorites. She requires you to speak a few times each class but will not call on you a second time, even  if your hand is raised, if you are not one of her favorite students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: SPN351<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Torres was great. Had this class been any other time rather than 8:00 AM, it would have been my favorite. She really tries to get everybody involved and likes to hear everyone participate. There is a lot of reading and can be repetitive at times, but it is interesting nonetheless. Overall awesome teacher. I learned so much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2010<br>Class Name: LST202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this class.  It was challenging but Torres loves her job and it spills over into the classroom.  Do the reading and keep up with the written assignments.  Definitely not a blow off class but if you put the time in you will learn a lot.  Torres is a must take for LA&LST majors</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2010<br>Class Name: LST202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. She's very passionate about her job. Class consisted of group discussions, so be prepared to say speak but that shouldn't be hard. Students are required to have prepared 4-5 sentence comments about readings, just talk about what you wrote. Reading is crucial for success in this class. Again great prof. Keep up the great work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely the BEST!!! I can't say enough about Prof Torres. She is super smart and funny! definitely have to do the work but material is interesting. daily comments on readings, two papers, and final paper. She expects you to work but its all worth it. I learned so much can't wait to take another class with her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: LSTLST<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor ever! Class readings are hard and she expects you to know the material like a book! She ridicules and will not be open minded to your opinion if it's not her opinion on it too. Tough grammar/paper writer. Never have I hated a professors teaching so much as hers!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2008<br>Class Name: ISP307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her Growing Up Latino. She has Excellent reading assignments. I loved her style, but if you don't read or give much thought to the class...she will be all over it. Most of the grade is based on short (6) 2 page essays. She grades like an English teacher..but is a very fair grader and allows for rewrites. I thought she was more than fair.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2008<br>Class Name: SPN352<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Still the most difficult professor at DePaul but you leave the class intrigued and more brilliant. The class is extremely complex (hence only for Spanish majors & 4th year) but extremely interesting and helps greatly with pronunciation all other SPN classes. One of favorite, worth-while classes taken!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Torres was the most articulate professor that I had last quarter. Sometimes her assignments turn out to be a huge workload, but you also learn a lot from them. She is a great teacher and really cares about what her students have to say.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2007<br>Class Name: SPN351<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an ok, Professor. She often rejects students comments if they are opinions and interpretations that differ from her own. Class sessions felt very repetitive and it often felt like she was relying on the discussion of reading material to fill class time rather than her actually giving personal insight or teaching in depth about the topic.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2006<br>Class Name: SPN352<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWFUL, if you have her as a spanish teacher. She may be a good professor for everything else, but spanish. The class was about pronunciation, not about GRAMMER.  If you think this class is only about speech..forget about it! She expects you know everything. !! It is not a laid back class..so Native Speakers. STAY AWAY! Lot of work. Not an easy &quot;A&quot;.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2006<br>Class Name: SPN351<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic professor. One of the best I have had in DePaul. She made me work, but she also put in the time to help her students. Very intelligent and articulate; I loved our weekly spanish conversations which allowed all of us to brush up on our spanish skills. She inspired me to do my best and work harder.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: LST307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Torres is an exceptional instructor. She will challenge everyone to do their Best and articulate ideas.  LST 307 involves volunteer work, so at time it may feel like a second job, but it is definately worth it.  If you are interested in chicana feminism this class is a must take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: LST<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an extremely boring professor who loads up the work. Taking one of her courses is like having a full time job. She totally favors females and tries ti impose her discusting ideas on the rest of the class. The things taught in class are all false and have no credibility. Furthermore, your almost restrained from speaking what is on your mind.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2005<br>Class Name: LST202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor I loved her she seemed rather intimidating at first, but she just wants you to do your best and is extremely understanding. Great discussions very informative and fun...all in all she made me want to minor in Latino Studies!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2005<br>Class Name: SOPHSEM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best teacher in the world! Okay, maybe not, but she is great in making class interesting.  Great &quot;real world&quot; class - opens your eyes.  She's very smart (Dr.) and assignments are super easy... Just keep up and you'll do fine.. I guarantee no regrets...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2005<br>Class Name: LATINOHIST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoy learning from this professor.

She is very clear, articulate, down to earth, and intelligent.  Although there was a lot of reading and writing, I actually enjoyed learning about the topics we discussed.  The best part of the class is the the class discussions.  It helped us get to know each other and hear other points of view. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2005<br>Class Name: LSTSEVERAL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Professor at DePaul! I loved every class I had with her. She is very intelligent and helpful. I even made her my advisor. You will love her as a professor, person, latina, woman, and more. If you are not a Latin American Studied major or minor then take at least one of her classes as an elective or liberal studies core. She is great!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: 63<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for &quot;Growing Up Latino in the US&quot; She must have hated me because she made sure to voice her distaste for my opinions. Not only that but a good portion of the class was spent discussing homosexuality which is fine but since it wasn't a class on homosexuality, it was a bit inappropriate.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2005<br>Class Name: LST307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher and she will help you with whatever you need. She does have strict rules, but you should always follow rules no matter what. All you have to do is do the work, readings, show up to class on time, and participate in class and you should be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: LST307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very great professor.
