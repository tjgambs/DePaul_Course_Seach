Clear, precise, knowledgeable, funny, and inquisitive about our knowledge base.  The only thing that is weird is he does not use technology.  Mostly everything is hand written, even the required papers and the end of the course.  All and all, it was still a great course!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2014<br>Class Name: 110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe honestly is the best teacher to have at DePaul and for a Chicago course. He is from the city, and loves what he teaches.  He isn't the best with assignments, but if you don't get it, he probably didn't get what he was saying either! Highly recommend him as a teacher, he is one of the best.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2014<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher. His art history class at the Art Institute is a real treat -- take all three parts, you will be glad you did. He is passionate about art history, Chicago, music (jazz and classical), has incredible charisma, fantastic story teller and a truly gifted teacher, who knows how to engage every student and keep them on track. The best!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just a fantastic professor. Incredible knowledge of basically everything. Mid lecture he'll start singing, or telling jokes. He tells great stories, and is always happy to help a student if needed. When it comes to assignments, instructions are extremely vague, but as long as you put in a slight amount of effort you'll get an A. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe is literally the best professor I have ever or will ever have. I was an atheist before taking his class. Now, I know there is a god...and his name is Joe.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joe i simply one of the best professors EVER. He knows just about everything about Chicago, Jazz, and Art. If you take Discover: Chicago and Jazz, you will not be disappointed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So knowledgeable and entertaining. The entire class was in love with him. Personable and truly tries to get to know his students. Take the class for his passion alone!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
