			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Buy Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />

I'm in her class right now for a summer session. It is hard. Basically your getting a weeks worth of material in a day. You're going to get a lot of homework. I actually had to call off of work today so I could finish it... She does single people out, its not uncomfortable but i do feel bad for so of the kids. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2015<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't like her. She was an okay professor, like she taught with good detail. But she was very strict (she'll kick you out for phone use, no laptops, if you don't turn in your homework in the first 5 minutes of class, you get no credit). She also personally got really rude and nasty with me, she was unprofessional with the whole situation.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2015<br>Class Name: HONSTATISTICS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a teacher she's fine, but assigns a ton of work. Personality-wise, I want to warn you: she is the closest thing to a real-life Umbridge that you will ever find. She talks to students like they're five and answers questions very condescendingly; she goes on a lot of tangents too. You'll pass her class, but you might not enjoy doing so.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>Unfortunately, Proffesor Esposito has been given the short end of the stick. She teaches & grades the way she is expected to by the school and doesn't give you much leeway. That said, pretty much every other math teacher gives enormous grade curves and tons of extra credit. She isnt one of those teachers and you have to work hard for your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: F</div><div id="right"><div>By far the worst math class ever.

She is very disorganized and hard to follow. She goes on random tangents and gets distracted easily. She makes constant mistakes on problems that she puts on the board. One or two errors is understandable, but multiple errors? Math is an exact science and as the professor, she should know how to do the problems. Avoid at all costs!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Esposito was by the far the worst professor i have EVER had.

She leaves out some important information, and make a lot of mistakes. NO take home finals or quizzes unlike what people said before. If you read the book you should get a C.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes a lot of mistakes.  If she understands what she is teaching she does a good job, but the further you go in the book the less she understands and the less she can teach very well.  Don't take this class if you need someone to hold your hand through math classes. but otherwise pretty easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved her class. I have never had a math teacher that is so helpful and explains everything in detail. She is a really nice person. She gives quizes everyday, that gets annoying but do the homework and you will get an A/B on everyone. Best math teacher I have had at DePaul. I honestly miss her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/18/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Because she was so easy before, she snapped and changed everything around.  Her example problems don't explain sh**, the book doesn't explain sh**, she collects and grades your homework with problems that she didn't explain, and she quizzes you with problems NOT from the homework. The final's takehome but only 20% of your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2006<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is pretty easy and lets you use notes</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is nice but she makes A LOT of mistakes which kind of killed her credibility.  Quiz every day (from HW), midterm, final (both worth 40%).Gave a sample of midterm, changed numbers on a real one.  Final was a take home. Basically no reason why you should get less than an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2006<br>Class Name: BUSCALC126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite Math teacher ever!!!!!!

She comes in early every day before class to help students with their homework.  She does examples directly from the book, so you know it will be relevant to the homework.  Calculus is a hard class, but if you're willing to put the time in to learn it, you will do well in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: 125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have a pretty good understanding of Calc.  This professor is a total moron.  One must know Calculus before one can teach it.  She most definitely does not know what she is doing.  Every class she gets 2nd guessed by students and she only knows the answers because she has her little cheat sheets up there with her  as she writes them on the board.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2005<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you dont get an A in this, your a pure idiot.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
