If you want an A in the intersession format and you work full-time, get ready to put in a decent amount of time to study outside of class.  Wish Dr. D taught other general MGT classes. Definitely recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2011<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Dierdorff explained the material so clearly, and made the lectures so engaging, that I enjoyed going to class and learning the material.

Take his course for MGT 555!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2011<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class in a compressed format, 6 hours of lecture on Saturdays.  Dr Dierdorff kept the class lively and interesting and kept me engaged throughout.  His use of clickers, examples, and humor make the class very enjoyable and promotes a learning environment.  This is the professor to take for MGT555!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2011<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor that I've ever had at DePaul! It is very clear that he knows the subject material quite well, and that he actually cares about his students' development. I've learned a lot in the course - I think a lot of other professors have a lot to learn from him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2011<br>Class Name: MGT525<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor ever. I have taken both MGT 555 and MGT 525 and I wish he had more classes to take him again. His class is strongly based on studies and evidence-based management. Book is important but not essential. He is very knowledgeable and an amazing instructor. If you study his notes and follow his instructions you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2011<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear prof. He lectures quite a bit, but does ask the students questions to keep them involved during the class. Impressive professional history and has lots of real-world examples. Tests are easy if you read his lecture powerpoints. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2011<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For what I consider a boring class, he did an amazing job.  Very thorough, and keeps the class interesting.  Would not take any other professionl for 555 from what I have heard from other students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: MGT525<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor, highly recommended. He's a brilliant professor who knows how to teach his material. One of DePaul's greatest assets.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: MGT320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Went into this class expecting a good, smart professor and that is what I got.  Dr. D is sharp, entertaining and knows his stuff.  I really enjoyed his class.  I did not understand all the hoopla about him being &quot;hot&quot; at first. But after ahile he seriously grew on me... He has a lot of charisma and charm.  Take him and you won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2010<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Dierdorff is a great prof who is constantly trying to improve his teaching. (And it shows.) He provides statistical analyst on all of his topics to support his opinions and is crystal clear about his assignments.  Not an easy A but certainly a fair teacher.  I would highly recommend him for any class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2009<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good prof. Tough grader, but I suppose he's fair. He may take HR a little too seriously, but that's okay. Just float his ego a bit and youll get a long way in his class...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. D, is the best professor at DePaul, period. In the many classes I have taken at DePaul, I think only his classes were structured and had clarity. He not only has a fantastic breadth and depth of knowledge, but his ability to transfer knowledge to students is amazing. Great professor and a good person. Great going  Dr. D.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2009<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class!Great professor. Delivers the lectures in a short,engaging and easy to follow manner.Follows students' progress every class through i-clicker and short Qs and adjusts and develops better methods of teaching in relation to students' needs and understanding.I highly recommend him Very helpful,pleasant.Best looking/dressed Prof. in DPU!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2009<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take Dierdorff.  He's an awesome professor (and he knows it, but that's ok).  Classes are highly entertaining but you still learn a lot. Keeps you engaged.  I-clickers are fun.  Hey Dr. D, lay off the school a little.. you're going to jade us. haha</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/04/2009<br>Class Name: MGT525<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Dierdorff was his usual entertaining self.  He's a great lecturer and delivers information in an interesting way.  Good course content.  I-clicker usage keeps things lively.  Class included a large group project (w/presentation) and final.  Excellent professor and a good class.  Very highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2009<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Dierdorff is hands down the best TEACHER I have had including undergrad. He gauged class comprehension via iClicker (use should be mandatory school-wide), so we spent more time on subjects needing more attention. The guy knows what he's talking about & his resume proves it. He cares that students learn & does not talk down to them. 12/08 course</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: MGT525<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher.  i just wish he also taught finance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2009<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic professor! His lectures are clear, concise and relevant to today's business world. There are a lot of good takeaways from this class. The class was a little easy, but I still learned a lot -- so, seems like a win-win, eh&#63; My only regret is that I took the class in a shortened period -- probably could have learned a lot more otherwise!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would certainly agree with the other comments. Dr. Dierdorff made the full day lectures very entertaining. He is an amazing speaker and delivers the lectures very clearly to the entire class. I definitely learned a lot of KSAs in this class. Homework, paper and final were easy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. D. is a great professor.  He keeps his classes lively with humor and electronic voting exercises.  He teaches the important concepts and doesn't get lost in the details.  Never got bored in his class.  I wish it went on longer. His personality and demeanor are unique among professors.  Final was straight-forward and easy.  Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2008<br>Class Name: MGMT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Hands down the best professor I've taken at DePaul. Dr. D knows his subject matter, comes well prepared, engages students, is quick to help and very fair. He is a diamond in the rough and I was impressed by his lectures. You will learn in this class, and not because it's &quot;easy&quot;, but because he makes you want to learn. Awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best classes I had at DePaul so far. Class is fun and useful at the same time. I didn't get bored for a second during Dr. Dierdorff's lectures. Assignments are pretty easy, no surprises on the test.

There are a couple assignments but he is an easy grader.  The tests are straight out off the reviews the week before.

He managed to keep my attention during the 7 hours of teaching which is a true skill.  He understands that most students are not going to be HR professionals and ensures that you understand the basics.
