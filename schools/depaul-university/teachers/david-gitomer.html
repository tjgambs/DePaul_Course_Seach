He puts a lot of effort in his lectures. Yes, he gives a lot of work, but he is extremely helpful, gives students lots of chances to make up their work, and gives a lot of extra credit. If you're lazy, don't take this class. Take it if you want to genuinely learn about HInduism.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: REL242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I might be one of the worst online students ever. I forgot to do so many assignments throughout the quarter. But DG is a really good guy. He let me make up nearly all of my missed assignments, and genuinely seemed to care about me passing the class. Id never take this particular class again but i would take another class with DG as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2014<br>Class Name: REL243242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Weekly quizzes you can take multiple times but still impossible to ace. Multiple Essays  Each must be written with documented assistance. At least 3 books for course. HOURS AND HOURS of vocal lectures online. By far the hardest online teacher. BUT! if you are seriously interested you will gain so so much. Also if you struggle he will help a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2014<br>Class Name: REL243<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The workload for this course has felt like 3 combined courses. Extra credit is offered, but you have a hard time keeping up with what you have to do already. Due dates are always on weekends. Sundays included. The video lectures move incredibly slow and were not created well. Group work, in person meetings, book review,  quizzes, and much more.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: REL242<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ridiculously difficult course. Do NOT take if you have no interest in Hinduism. Assignments due throughout the week AND weekend. If you are a forgetful/unorganized person, Gitomer is NOT the professor for you. Overall, I did like the class, but I worked my butt off every day. He does offer extra credit, which helps.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2013<br>Class Name: REL243<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Dr. Gitomer's online class on Buddhism: thinking it would be a walk in the park. This was probably the most difficult class I have ever taken. However, if you try very hard and apply yourself to the utmost you will find yourself extremely knowledgeable in this field of religion. He takes the "online   class" format very seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2012<br>Class Name: REL243<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I ignored the advice I read on this site, and I regret that now. UNREASONABLE workload in the extreme. I have had 300 level, major specific classes that were easier than this; I have never before had this amount of sheer work for a class. He ruins the subject by giving absurd amounts of work. Don't take this class, just don't.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2012<br>Class Name: HINDU242<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He ruins a very interesting subject by insuring that his students will dread the very word Hindu by the end.  The work load - watching videos of him, meeting numerous times with consultants about your papers...The reading,  My God the reading!!!  My Mother watched me struggle through and remarked that she didn't work that hard for much of her PhD.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2012<br>Class Name: REL243<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I take my education very seriously and am used to a heavy work load. However, the load for this course is UNREASONABLY excessive. He is more concerned with people "taking the online course seriously" than teaching the material, which has no flow. He does not trust his students  and ignores other academic obligations they may have. STAY AWAY!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: REL243<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Aside from being a very arrogant and pompous man Dr. Gitomer is actually very knowledgeable in his field. Yet his over zealous approach towards his class leads his students to over look that. I use to be a Biology major and his work load can be equated to my bio work load. I would never take him again and it would benefit you not too either.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2012<br>Class Name: REL243<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gitomer is well versed and very knowledgeable in terms of the material covered in this course, but the workload is excessive and his teaching methods reflects his intellectual arrogance rather than his effective ability to teach his students the vast catalog of material covered in the course. Knowledgeable yes, effective teacher-absolutely not.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2012<br>Class Name: YOGAREL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dont listen to the other comments this teacher is among the best depaul has to offer in terms of how much knowledge he has to offer, Ive taken yoga/tantra and Hinduism and have learned more from these classes than other classes combined.

If you are interested in learning about the material, and not an easy A, than his class succeeds any students expectations. rel 344</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: AAS290<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man actually caused me to write my first review on this site. Never, have I ever, put so much work into a class and received such a poor grade. With it being online I thought it would be the same amount of work but it ended up being about 4X as time consuming.

By far the worst professor I've had at DePaul. Simply arrogant and patronizing. Please, for your own sake, do not take his class.
