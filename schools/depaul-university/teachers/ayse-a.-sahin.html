Take her if you have a chance. This is the second class I have taken with her, and I dont have anything to complain. Her exams are tough though so that's up to you to put the effort.

We can't figure out where she is from. She is kinda weird. She can be entertaining, in an annoying way. Her labs are busy work and only occasionally helpful.
