I reached out to him with ease for papers. He's very passionate about what he teaches and is very respectful of everyone's views. I regularly attended classes and did the readings, so this class was a breeze. We did 3 papers and 1 presentation, which is really nice. I'm taking him next quarter because he is just AWESOME!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2012<br>Class Name: SOC279<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a soft-spoken, extremely pleasant guy. But he has an obsession with health that students may not hold. He expects a research paper to be written before one's taken research methods. But he will provide A LOT of help if sought. Midterm and final not the easiest... specificity is the key.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: SOC279<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult class simply because of the subject.  Very helpful especially when students go in for office hours. Also very polite/friendly in class, and took time out for his students to make sure everyone understood material. If students had a tough time in the class, it was their own fault for not going to class/not asking questions. Great class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2012<br>Class Name: SOC351<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough grader, but knows what he is teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2011<br>Class Name: SOC279<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hard class.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
