It was a difficult task,but in the end it got published in a student journal. Learned more one on one about social science than any class at depaul.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2014<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very interested in politics, however the class was not very interesting to me. All lectures, and not much student engagement. He is also a very tough grader! Final and midterm are all essay, along with the two other papers. Not a lot of work but grades hard</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2014<br>Class Name: PSC263<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not an easy grader, but he's not tough either. Class discussions were kept interesting. His lectures were great too. If you pay attention and take good notes, you can learn a lot in his classes. PSC majors should definitely take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2014<br>Class Name: PSC263<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a good teacher, and the class was very interesting too. The topics were interesting and current. He's not a push over, but not super easy either. Take his class, you will learn a lot and enjoy his lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This class seemed easy but Professor Mello is a very tough grader. His political views were crystal clear and he didn't make an effort to hide them. Very knowledgeable</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2013<br>Class Name: PSC269<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof, always excited by the class material, did a great job encouraging discussion, often playing the devil's advocate. Definitely has high expectations for the writing assignments, but his criticism is constructive and detailed.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: PSC269<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far one of the best professors I have had at DePaul. He keeps you engaged during class with discussions and he goes over basically everything in the textbook; minimal reading done in this class and I still did very well. I am looking forward to taking more classes with this professors. Weekly journal assignments, midterm, and final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: PSC269<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor and a great course.  Does a great job of keeping the class discussion flowing and does not put his opinion above the students.  Can be a hard grader but if you do the reading and come to class ready to talk you will do fine.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
