However, unless you are already fluent in German do not bother with the program. If you enjoy being ignored in class for not having perfect German or working with students who have spent YEARS in Germany who then come back to take undergraduate level courses, then this is the program for you! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: GER202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Souchuk is friendly and engaging. Her expectations are laid out very clearly. Some of the texts can be a little bizarre. If you put in the effort and try, it should be good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2015<br>Class Name: GER201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Clear and organized, Souchuk will keep you from being confused about what is expected.  She is friendly and will engage you in conversation.  Though the grading can be tough, it is fair and appropriate.  She is flexible if you generally make an effort and go to class.  Very good overall.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2014<br>Class Name: GER300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Souchuk is my all time favorite professor and the reason for me completing a German Major! She is so nice as a person and such a great, knowledgeable professor! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2014<br>Class Name: GERM306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I used to really like Anna as a professor, but after taking her classes for a year, I realized it is really just the same class every quarter-- reading, answering questions, and discussions. It's more like German Book Club. This quarter all the books followed the theme of rape, incest, or pedophilia. There's more to German Literature than that.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2014<br>Class Name: GER314<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher, creative way of teaching a language and makes it truly interesting. As long as you make the effort to do the work and readings, her classes are awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2013<br>Class Name: GER201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Souchuk is very helpful and knows the material she is teaching. She is very fluent and has a good accent when speaking German. Easy on the grades. Course workload isn't overwhelming. If you display any interest in German language she is more than willing to help. I would definitely recommend her and DePaul's German program as well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2013<br>Class Name: GERGER<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Souchuk is a very effective teacher. She throws in grammar exercises and relevant German literature and films. She's so pretty and smart..she's perfect! Although seems intimidating at first,  she's actually down to earth and funny. Always willing to help. Definitely someone to look up to.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2013<br>Class Name: GER105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely love this professor. When learning a language, the professor is crucial in how well you do. She can explain things well, can make the class laugh, and every assignment or activity we do is actually really helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2012<br>Class Name: GERGER<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Totally take her classes- She organizes class time very well, has an engaging teaching style, and really encourages class participation. And she's strict re: having only German spoken in class, which definitely helps with language skills. Not only are the classes themselves interesting, but assignments & projects are also interesting and creative.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2012<br>Class Name: GER201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously awesome German professor, very clear, helpful, and nice!

She is down to earth, engaging, and funny. I always looked forward to my German classes because of her. The workload is manageable and the topics covered are very interesting. Easily my favorite professor at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: GER397<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ich liebe prof. souchuk</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
