			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

You can't expect to do well if you don't attend class, re-read the handouts, re-work the quizzes, and do the questions from the CPA review book required for the class.

Final was impossible! He's really good at explaining the material. The midterm is very much like the notes, the final also is, but he mixes concepts together so you need to know everything to be able to interrelate it in the test. I guess it's it's a painfully necessary class...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tax is an extremely difficult subject and Roberts does his best to help you understand. He's extremely passionate about the subject and his subtle humor is interesting. If you do the handouts ahead of class, it makes it 10 times easier to understand while he's teaching it. One of the few A's I got in my accounting classes but it was a lot of work</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2009<br>Class Name: ACC360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His handouts are golden!

Wastes time venting his Bush hatred.  Does not explain things well. Jumps around and does not follow the syllabus so it is difficult to study before hand.  His handouts are ok but poorly formatted.  The one thing I thought he taught well was depreciation recapture.  The book is so-so and the Code is useless.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: ACC360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You'll be intimidated by him at first, but he's awesome. Tax is ridiculously boring, but he actually makes an effort to liven it up a bit. The packets are the key to success. Memorize them inside and out and you'll get an A on both the midterm and final... final is harder, though! Overall, great class, great professor... take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2008<br>Class Name: ACC548<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough, but overall, fair. You have to consistently do the work in this class and use all of the materials available to you. Too much detail material to cram for final. He is an entertaining, and VERY knowledgeable instructor, makes himself available, etc. About as lively as a tax class is going to get. Final harder than midterm. DON'T miss classes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2008<br>Class Name: ACC360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>David Roberts was a great professor.  All the material you need is contained in packets he gives you.  All you need to study for the midterm and final are these packets and some practice quizzes he gives.  Aside from that, he is very knowledgeable, and his lecutres are actually interesting.  Definitely the professor to take for 360.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: ACC548<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He talks really fast and doent give student a chance to ask questions.  Goes over alot of information not on the test.

You have to give a 15min presentation, write a paper about your presentation, and then write another paper for the take home final.

He knows his stuff and makes it as easy as possible. Tells you what might be on the exam. Final, midterm, mini-essays only. Book is only needed for advanced prep.

He hands out numerous 20 page packets for notes for the m/t and final.  It is pretty annoying that he spends a LOT of time on things that he will later tell you are not on the tests.  You really need to go to his class to find out what is or is not on the test.  Memorize his notes and a B is really not that hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: ACC360<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>MIDTERM, FINAL. HARD AND deceiving.

Hardest tests ever! I have never gotten a C before in my life (and neither had the majority of my class). He is not helpful when you ask questions.
