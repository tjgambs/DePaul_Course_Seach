She will loose it in class b/c you haven't done your work. DO NOT DISAGREE with her, she will hunt you down. She is not good at explaining and gives a lot of reading. Be prepared to kiss ass ( she is especially tolerant if u do)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2004<br>Class Name: SOC105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has no self confidence, which results in her inability to teach well. She takes students' critical statements as a personal offense. She will freak out in class and kick the entire class out.
