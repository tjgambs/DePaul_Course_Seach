He goes over everything in detail, so just go to class and pay attention and take notes and study and you'll do perfectly fine on the tests! You shouldn't have to try too hard. Has a slight Cuban accent, he's funny too... Overall enjoyable course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2012<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Curet is an outstanding professor!! He is incredibly fair and willing to negotiate your grade with you if you don't agree with it. Powerpoints were clear and easy to follow/copy. Tests are VERY straightforward--pay attention in class and you'll pass easily. VERY helpful during labs. Has a sense of humor, too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2012<br>Class Name: ANT109<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult class for a 100, never left very helpful comments on papers. Tough grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Curet loves the subject he teaches.  However, he wasn't that great of a teacher.  He checked attendance every day. Notes were from power points (which were not online and we had to take our own notes).  Tests (midterm and final) were unclear and honestly caused me to do worse (I studied a lot). And I got a B for a 100 level class. Don't recommend.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
