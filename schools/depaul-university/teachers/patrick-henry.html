Don't take him if you don't want to work. Read your book and your notes and you will be fine. Awesome lecturer, brings tons of energy to class, and really funny. His office hours are limited, which is my only complaint.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2004<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher.

Do the readings, put effort into your papers, and participate and you'll do great and love the class. He's not bad to look at for a couple hours either.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Henry expects people to read and write at the college level. There is always something to do every week (either a test or a paper), which are both easy if you read the book.
