She taught right out of the book and doesnt explain in her own words. Expected us to remember things taught in algebra last quarter and didnt go over anything. I took that years ago!! Never replies to emails and is always late.

I had to teach myself pretty much everything. I've noticed that pretty much all the math teachers suck at DePaul? I wish she was a good teacher. She was nice but she is not meant to teach and it sucks that we have to pay so much for a sub-par teacher just because she has a 10 year.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2013<br>Class Name: MAT100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: D+</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice person however a very poor instructor. Our homework was through Pearson. Her lectures were fast and did not reflect homework. Pearson online sometimes would grade inaccurate. She was aware. Went to the tutoring center frequently and saw anywhere from 5-7 students from my class when I was there. I hired a private tutor. Horrible class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2012<br>Class Name: MAT100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is like an elementary teacher in her demeanor and delivery, but sweet old lady.

She does not respond to emails and does not go over homework in class. You end up teaching yourself all of the material from the book.

If you are forced to take this class buy MYMATHLAB even though it is not required. She can't teach you, you have to learn it on your own. Tests are short, so if you miss one question you fail.

The examples she uses are exactly the ones on her quizzes and tests. You have to study outside of class as well as pay attention in class.

Professor has little to no interaction with the students, quiet, dull, homework is not checked, exams are 70% of the grade, the rest is quizzes and participation (which does not exist).

She is by far the WORST teacher at DePaul.  I don't even know how she was certified to be a teacher.  She needs to teach pre-school oh no wait they won't even understand her.  Her test and quizzes are impossible because she makes them up herself.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice lady, but her tests have material she never taught in class.

Her biggest problem is her lecture talent, she continuously reitterates how easy material is despite her inability to clarify. Homework is not collected which is probably a bad thing, if your not good learning on your own expect a C at best!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class; do the readings; pay attention to his lectures and study the slides.

Midterm and final were very difficult. Study the slides. You don't need to study anything else. There is also one paper, 3 quizzes, and a couple in-class group assignments. Ok class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO not take her for BMS 126! She makes the material harder, doesn't know answers to homework questions.

She's a nice lady, but the lectures aren't that clear. Feels like she takes the scenic route on a lot of explanations when they're rather simple. Lots of homework given but none collected. Several quizzes, a midterm, a final, makes up your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2005<br>Class Name: REL273<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is by far the most boring class I have ever had. He just talks and talks and talks some more. I really tried to get into the material but he just sucks the life from it. I absolutely hate going to his class. As for the “yah&#63;” after everything he says, they get really annoying after a while.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is clearly not capable of teaching a Calculus class. She is very sweet but if you take her class you will not learn a thing,trust me! Do not believe these other ratings when it comes to BMS .

If you show that you are trying she will help you.

Unless you are completely brain dead you will understand everything he says. He is not at all boring. Actually, quite the contrary. His lectures are very interesting and discussion is encouraged. All the dumb students who have ADD sit in the back and zone out.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2004<br>Class Name: REG228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2004<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher...if you work, come to class, take the quizes, and do the readings you will definately get a B...work a little harder by actually studying for the final and you are guaranteed an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2004<br>Class Name: MATH101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very sweet lady, tries to make math painless.
