Even after the class ends she is willing to help students out with their careers. Capstone class had lots of work that could be considered "tough love". Lots of tough work but 100% WORTH IT! I had her for PRAD intro class as well. Learned a lot, did well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor, lenient in grading presentations and helpful when you have a question.
