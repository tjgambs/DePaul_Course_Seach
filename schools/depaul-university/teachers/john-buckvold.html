Teaches you how to write professionally yet does not lead by example. His emails to the class are all written in the subject field... real professional. Super unfair grader.

He does not know how to teach and really should not continue to.  I have taken my fair share of online classes and this was by far the worst one.  Nothing is clear, he does not give help, he's rude when you make a mistake.  Do not take him.  You will regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class (and professor) are the biggest waste of time.  This is a freshman level class that consumes more time than all of my intermediate Finance classes combined.  Useless assignments and useless lectures.  He is a very tough grader.  This course should be removed from the university.  The entire class time feels like pulling teeth.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2014<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>I rarely rate professors poorly because most of their teaching styles and expectations can be understood and adapted to...however....This professor makes this easy course needlessly confusing, avoids giving help (or does so with an attitude) and scatters necessary information around for students to play hide-and-seek in order to find.

These bad ratings scared me before the class started, but I didn't think it was bad. His assignments are so easy, the major assignment is the research paper which you work on for like half the quarter! There's only like 2 other small assignments, so if you're stuck with him its not bad!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2014<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a terrible class.

But he tells you what he expects in the online lectures. 4 cases, 1 case due every week, the longest one is 1.5 page. He let you do drafts and 1 rewrite for the first 2 cases. Watch the online lectures! They help your cases a lot. Weekly quizzes, the lowest score one is dropped. Do every thing he assigns before you start the quiz!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2011<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very clear on what he wants in the memos.

This class is a waste of time. And this opinion comes from a guy who writes tons of email and communications in the real corporate world. He punishes for creativity and personal touch. I dont know if there is a profesor at DePaul whom I hated so much. My GPA was 3.8 before taking this class. Past tense. Do urself a favor. Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2010<br>Class Name: WRD201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a very fun class at all, pretty boring.

Enthusiastic. Yes, he's picky but for good reason. Will learn something. He's not very helpful b/c he's paranoid that will give away the &quot;solutions&quot; to writing these cases. However, put in the effort & it'll pay off. Fair grader, expect him to be picky & a little unpredictable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2010<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most biased graders I've ever had.

When I say he's a hard grader, I mean he tells you nothing about what he looks for when he grades, and he'll rag on you for not including the most insignificant details. Avoid if possible</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he really is not as bad as they make him out to be. he really loves what hes teaching and is really nice about helping with papers. his final is only 8 pages when a lot fo the other wrd 104 classes finals are 25 pages. his class is boring though and he goes over a lot of things many of us already know.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2009<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher, bias and every way he teaches you to write is NEVER used in real life he thinks he knows how to write PERFECT and yet every example he showed in class is worse than any of his students writings</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2009<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would stay away from this class. He is a very hard grader. Everything is very dated the book hasn't been published in 10-15 years. When other classes are doing resumes and other relevant things we were doing memos that aren't used in offices anymore. He is not clear on what he wants and hasn't realized that the business world uses e-mail now!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2009<br>Class Name: WORD202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! Biggest ass at DePaul. Not only is his class pointless (drafting e-mails and office memos) he is an extremely difficult grader.  Diction and a style of writing that would get you an A in any other Word class is at best a B in his.  Do yourself a favor and take this class with a different professor.  Boring, rude and a tool.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you want an A, just listen to what he wants on every assignment. Making your own ideas and assumptions will pretty much fail you. He is a rough teacher, but allows rewrites and gives alot of notes when editing, so just change it to what he wants and you got the A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One word says it all.  Pathetic.  I have never met a professor who grades so unfairly.  He is a slightly prejudice person. Overall, I think a small bar of soap is more knowledgeable than he is.  Do not take him unless you want to get annoyed for 3 months.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He demands a lot out of you, but he is always available if you need help or if you just want to ask for help.

His class was challenging but informative.  He demands a standard that I think all University students should be able to meet.  I saw that someone wrote that he was mean-that is bunk.

He is not a very nice or approachable person and his grading is ridiulous. I have never gotten below a B on ANYTHING and I got a C+ on a paper I worked really hard on.

DO NOT take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely terrible.  You will have no idea what this man is asking for on his &quot;papers&quot;.  I literally revised a paper by adding bullets and changed my grade on it from a c+ to an a.

Terrible. Terrible.  Do NOT take as a night class. I've never had problems taking night classes, but his is so boring I contemplate leaving every week.
