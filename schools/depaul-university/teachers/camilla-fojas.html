I took this class as an lsp requirement. It was fun, insightful and she did the best to engage students with different methods. I highly recommend you take her if you have to take lsp 200.  she is fair and gives enough time for projects that are actually fun!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2014<br>Class Name: LGQ150<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice woman. She offers extra credit. Her grading is a little inconsistent. Her LGBTQ midterm was very difficult, but she gave plenty of extra credit to make up for it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2011<br>Class Name: LST203<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is great! Sense of humor really made her class discussions interesting. As a Latin American Studies major I have to admit that I learned a lot from Professor Fojas. I would recommend her without hesitation.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was such a nice teacher, but very soft spoken. She didn't return any assignments we did... so none of us knew what we were gonna get in the class. We mostly all ended up with A's and B's though. We have one group presentation and then the final was an essay final. It was a pretty easy class and she shows interesting movies. Take it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2008<br>Class Name: LIFE101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's more than meets the eye.

Interested in mainly film the entire class and runs out of time on everything. Final is 4 in class essays, other than that just 1 main paper, a group presentation and lots of reading that isn't necessary.  Overall mediocre class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2005<br>Class Name: LSTVARIOUS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.

Very meek. The class was pretty interesting but why are we studying parks in a class about Chicago in the media&#63; Assumed that all students were from the Chicago area. Somewhat frustrating.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She chose films for this course that really fit the ideas she was teaching and were also modern and interesting.
