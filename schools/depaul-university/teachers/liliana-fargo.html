Her experience and knowledge adds to her lectures. She will always add real-world examples and is very clear. Her tests and quizzes are all online, so be sure to take notes during her lectures. She doesn't need a text book, but instead creates her own structure. She's an awesome professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2014<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures drag on because all she does is talk, but her notes actually help if your mind doesn't wander. I took for for ECO 105 as well and the classes are set up the same way. 2 attempts on every quiz, the midterm and final, all online, and it's so easy to get an A on them because of the 2 attempts. Highly recommend her!

It was informative, but mostly graded on attendance, quizzes, and a final group project. Her real-world (and real-time) examples were perfect in describing macro-economics concepts, but I expected more of a challenge from an MBA course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2013<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful, cares about students learning.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2013<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrific professor.  The class is very easy to understand and she tries to make it as simple as possible. If you put in the time and go to class there is no reason you should get below a B.

I do not understand why some people try to trash her here. She explains econ in a very easy way, and has passion for teaching,and provides useful handouts.

She prints out the notes for you and just reads off them. HW, midterm and final are all online. They are based on the PP she gives in class. Sometimes there are Qs about current events.

No textbook required, just powerpoint. Weekly quizzes, 1 midterm, 1 final. ALL are online and you have 2 attempts. Decent teacher/decent class/ though if your an econ major, you might end up wanting more.

ALL YOU NEED TO SUCCEED: 1) Print out notes before class, 2) Go to every class, 3) take notes during class, 4) Do the online quizzes. Seriously, that's it. None of the material is that complicated and the best part is you don't even need the textbook.

I want to say that the class is easy because all the exams are take home online, but they are very difficult. There is no hw so its easy to fall behind and slack off. You also don't need the book.
