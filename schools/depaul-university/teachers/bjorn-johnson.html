You will have a better understanding of Corporate Finance. If you do ALL the above-mentioned, you will pass.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2013<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Probably one of the best FIN professors I had here at DePaul.  Yes, it is a tough class, but his expectations and grading are very reasonable.  He responds to emails very quickly and is always polite and professional. It was a pleasure taking a class with him.  Definitely a quality guy who really knows his stuff!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2013<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>I would highly recommend this instructor for anyone with an actual interest in Corporate Finance. Don't take this for an easy A (though possible), but to actually learn something. Bjorn is helpful both in and out of class and the cases are straight-forward while complex enough to actually learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2012<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>FIN555 is a hard subject, but I felt that Bjorn made the class feasible for those of us who are not finance majors.  He is very helpful in and outside of class, I would highly recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super smart guy. Midterm was hard and he did not really explain what was going to be on it but he does curve. He was a lot more clear with what was going to be on the final, which was also curved. He's more than willing to help if you ask.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took his class this term. super nice guy. emails are always considerate.  Homework is more than average but It's really fundamental. He also helped our CME trading chanllenging group. Take his class, and communicate with him, he is always willing to help. Accent is not that severe, I can understand what he said even as a foreigner.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice professor.Really considerate professor. Smart! But,severe accent,reading PPT and too much outside work. Tests are little tough, but he is always trying to grade you high.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2011<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is average teacher. But he is knowledgeable. You need to ask questions to get better understanding of the subject.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Super nice guy. Extremely helpful and able to help students with anything part of the course. Unfortunately, for those who can't even do simple math like how to get the average/mean, or refuse to do any work, you will find this class hard, or that the professor grades harshly (like previous 2 comments).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He illustrates materials clearly and give cases which are highly-related to the real world. And the cases are not that hard ,if you pay attention in the class. reply your question quickly.Maybe it is the first year for him to teach,so he doesn't know how to excite or please you guys... After all,he is a excellent guy except a little european accent</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bjorn really cares about how well his students are doing. However, this courses requires HOURS and HOURS of outside work.  Tests are difficult, Cases are graded tough and many meetings outside class are required. I would avoid this class if I could.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No passion for teaching, don't make class interesting, hard to understand and makes the tests extremely difficult when they don't need to be. Reads powerpoints to you. I would drop a class and delay graduation to avoid taking him again.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
