I learned so much & she was really explanatory. She worked with me several time outside of class & helped me structure my paper. She does demand excellence, but this is DePaul, not UIC. If you don't want to do the work or if it's &quot;too much&quot; then move out of the way & make room for the rest of us. As for this class, take it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2011<br>Class Name: HST171<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't doubt she is a good scholar, but she is a horrendous teacher. I went in with a fairly high level of interest in medieval history, but she just reaffirmed my assumption that medieval history is full of arrogant stiffs. She hasn't reassessed her expectations after teaching high level courses at Princeton (which she always mentions).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2011<br>Class Name: HIST171<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She can be very intimidating, and fairly scary. She obviously knows what she is talking about. She assigns a lot of reading, and will not hesitate to assign an entire book along with a couple of 10-page primary sources for you to read when a paper is due. If you show enthusiasm, you're her favorite. Her participation system is pretty awful though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2011<br>Class Name: HIST171<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible and very Rude! Tests are based of lecture which she does not provide any type of visual for. Be prepared to write till your hand falls off. Rude to students and almost the whole class dropped, that should speak for itself.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2011<br>Class Name: HIST171<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very intelligent and passionate about history. Very important to go to class and be prepared to study hard and take a lot of time on analysis papers.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
