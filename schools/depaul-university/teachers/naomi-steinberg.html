That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this class, and found Professor Steinberg to be a fair grader, and accessible if I needed assistance. One quiz every week, but self-graded and thus on the honor system. Take home midterm and final</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: REL270<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't recommend this class. An ok professor, but plays favorites to feminists and people who are Jewish. The feminists who take this class are the worst-loud, ignorant, and rude. Easy work, just 3 papers. If you ignore the ignorant people you'll be fine. Don't buy the WBC book- didn't use it still got an A. Men, we're the minority in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2011<br>Class Name: CTH212<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was genuinely interested in the subject and seemed to want to portray her understanding to her students. However, when approached with questions and comments she was somewhat hostile and not open to others opinions. A portion of the grade was based on participation but I didn't want to bc she was sometimes intimidating. The class was easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2011<br>Class Name: REL232<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seems really nice initially. BUT once the discussions (which are actually more like lectures) start, if you disagree with her views, she will shut you down, like she doesn't have any interest in what you have to say. She seems to take every criticism toward the Bible personally. If you think you will be able to give another opinion, think again</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2010<br>Class Name: REL270<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No. Awful - plays favorites, hates anyone who disagrees with her, wants you to write papers like a 3 year old. Dumb your papers down and you'll be ok. She's intimidating and discouraging. She seems to hate Christians + anyone who's not a flaming feminist or a jew. I'm a smart guy and I'm not doing particularly well. Tempted to challenge my grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: REL270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a great teacher! Very inspirational and passionate.  I actually wanted to go to class.  She's very intelligent.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2009<br>Class Name: REL270<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this class. This prof plays favorites and is disrespectful to those that she doesn't agree with. Though she is knowledgeable of the Hebrew Bible she lacks an understanding of the New Testament. This is shows in how she teaches. She also leaves out important biblical histories. Course is extremely biased toward 1's with no Bible knowledge</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2009<br>Class Name: REL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher, reading was average, expect quizes papers, no exams. Would recommend very much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2007<br>Class Name: CTH212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We basically read the old testament and discussed the reading in class.  She always picked out the key points that you needed to know for the class.  If you take notes on what she says and participate, you should not have a problem. There were weekly mini-quizes and two papers instead of midterms and finals.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2007<br>Class Name: REL270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Go to class! 20% of your grade comes participation (different from attendance).  60% comes from 3 papers and 20% comes from daily journal entries that you turn in at the end of the quarter. I learned a lot from this class, but you have to go in with an open mind knowing that people are going to think different things.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2006<br>Class Name: REL270<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice lady, class wasnt too bad, however if you are not interested in religion or do not have any previous religion experiences to discuss, it makes it difficult to participate when she askes the class questions. Otherwise a pretty easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: REL270<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite class last quarter. It opened my mind to differant viewpoints of the Bible. I learned a lot. A) Attend class! B) Stay on top of daily journal entries C) Ask questions and get involved with discussion! There are no tests two 3 page papers and one 5 page paper. She is a great professor :) Be open minded in this class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2006<br>Class Name: REL4324<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is set up in a discussion format, so pay attention. She defiantly picks favorites and also picks on people, if no one knows the proposed question, she usually picks on the same 2-3 people to embarrass them time after time again. Donâ€™t take this class and if you do, make sure you know and can recite every page of the bible on queue</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2006<br>Class Name: RELIGION<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful and friendly.  Has a lot to teach but doesn't have to do it in a condescending manner like a lot of these stuck up brainiacs.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: REL270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To get an A:  1) Show up to every class. Attendance Counts. 2) Do the work. Journals, assignments, etc.  3) Midterm & Final papers get checked before hand with her. Then make proper corrections to get an A on them.  4) Participate on a DAILY basis  Overall, put forth an effort and do the work. If you do the class is real easy and you learn a </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2006<br>Class Name: REL270<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'd recommend her to other people. The class consists of daily journal entries, a take home midterm and a take home final. Overall it's pretty easy, but I only got a B in the class--a grade I'm pretty frustrated with. I didn't really put much of an effort into the class, though, so I guess if you do that it's highly likely you'll get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: ANCIENTISRAEL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is very nice,and gives great lectures. there's a weekly quiz so try not to miss class. there's a take home/paper midterm and final. its not a hard class but you gotta pay attention if you want a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2005<br>Class Name: BIBHEB111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS VERY HELPFUL.WILL MEET W/U OUTSIDE OF CLASS IF U NEED IT. QUIZES ALMOST EVERY WEEK, MIDTERM, AND FINAL. TAKE HER IF YOU WANT TO LEARN AND PASS WITH A DECENT GRADE.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: REL270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting teacher. you can easily get an A in her class if you just listen to what she is saying. When you write your journals and papers just write in the style she is intersted in even if you dont agree with her theology. Plus you might learn to view the bible in a different way which is her whole goal. no exams only journals, mid& final paper.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: REL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady. just participate and follow her lectures and it will be EASY.

Papers grading hard. Challenges your opinion ALL the time. Wants a response to retorical questions. Must nod head all the time. Just talk & nod your head when she talks.
