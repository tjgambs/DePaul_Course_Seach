TA and your classmates are your saving grace because youre all flunking together. If and when there is an inevitable emergency, it will not be excused regardless of documentation. Read your labs in advance and meet with the TA before lab. I give him a 0.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2014<br>Class Name: CHEM131<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. S is very unclear and hardly makes and effort to help students. His grading is soooo strict it's nearly impossible to get even a C in his class, and that's comming from someone who is great at chem. Do not take his class, you will stress ao much and it will murder your GPA by the end of the term.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2014<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had a tough time understanding Dr. Schraufnagel and his handwriting. He didn't explain the steps of our lab very clearly, which made following procedure and writing good lab reports very difficult--he graded those reports pretty tough too! For someone who struggles in chem already, I wouldn't recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2013<br>Class Name: CHEM1105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yeah, defiantly would not take this class again with him as the teacher. He isn't isn't clear with anything he says, doesn't really interact nor help any of his students. Just a very hard teacher too pay attention too, and ul find yourself dosing off very fast.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2013<br>Class Name: CHEM129<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good guy, can come off a bit mean at first but he warms up to you by the end of the quarter. My advice to you is ask him what exactly he expects on lab reports because by the time you get your lab reports you are already doing horrible in class and have to score almost perfect on the next few to be able to pass the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2012<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Schrauf comes off bad at first, is pretty tough, and is slightly unclear. However, his high expectations were a good preparation for what was to come in college chemistry. His humor is kind of funny and cares about students. Just lighten up to him and he will be willing to help. Failed first two but got the hang of it and got a b+ in the end</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2011<br>Class Name: CHE115<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Schraufnagel for 3 quarters and in hindsight I should have gone with another professor. The entire lab department is... it... has unwritten regulations that seem to disable students (I myself am not by the way normally complaining to the boss, but it seemed necessary) from doing well, mainly in specifics of how lab reports should be written.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2008<br>Class Name: CHELABS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He teaches labs for Gen Chem CHE 111-113-115. He's a big guy who at first he comes off as intimidating, strict, and unfriendly, but after having him for three quarters, I think he is hilarious! His dry sense of humor is great. He's very fair on lab reports and is pretty helpful. I'd take him again.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
