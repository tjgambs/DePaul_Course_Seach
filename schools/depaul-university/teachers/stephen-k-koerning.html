Concentrate on the midterm and final don't take it as a joke it's a big part of your grade! Know the concept and terms- its more than notes you have to read. So don't think you'll get by with notes.

Treats you like an adult and expects you to be prepared. Thats not a bad thing. Totally willing to help. He is very fair. He does not take things out on the class.

Assignments (4 of them total) are fairly easy, but make sure you start on the final project early!  2 tests (Midterm and Final) are not too hard</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome teacher..gives great examples..class is fun and he makes it exciting!! the fact that he's a cutie is a plus too..nice to look at and listen too!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very punctual, be on time to class and w/ H.W. Mini-Proj's are easy but have to read BK for midterm and final. Take advantage of the extra credit(5%+ grade), he talks about it at the beginning of class but no one does it till the end when it's too late.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2004<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, he is a good teacher, you need to study as well. He is verrrrrrrry anal about things. He will cut points for very small things. 4 mini projects one large, but he won't give you time to get to know your group, PAIN! Late 4 ur presnt and u cn't give one</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2004<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sooo helpful - VERY understanding about certain horrors of group work.  Fair, but make sure that you read the book for the tests.   I'm so tired of people thinking that they'll do well in a class simply by showing up.  he's funny too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2004<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are boring/dry (powerpoint slides).  The midterm and final are not that easy.  The miniprojects are easy but he takes off points for small things.  He is very picky and anal. He does not like giving A's at all.  So I suggest you DON'T take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2004<br>Class Name: MKG310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OK prof, lectures were fine and interesting, but exams are very hard. Didn't give enough time for the groups to break up, need as much time as possible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2004<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He genuinely cares about his students. You do about 4 mini 1 page papers. You have a midterm and final. He makes it seem like the tests are gonna be a piece of cake but you do need to study.  The midterm was 20%.  Plus one group project but it is fun!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
