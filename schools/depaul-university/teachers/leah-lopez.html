I can say with utmost certainty that I grew as a student in taking her class. She's funny and nice, and although her class is hard, she's available during office hours to look over papers and help make specific adjustments in order to get the grade you want. Incredible lady. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Warning to freshmen... she's hilarious and really really nice with an odd obsession with donuts, but she's such a tough grader that you'll hate her anyway.

She is so horrible, it's truly a shame! If you get stuck with Leah, see if you can SWITCH to a real professors class, like Dr. Platner's class. Assignments are inconsistent with her verbal portrayal.

She thinks she is trying to be witty and funny but she is not witty or funny. Some other people on here said she is a know-it-all and they are right--she definitely is.

Also, she had many grading mistakes with passive voice.. she hypes it up and has no idea what it is</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She taught about FAIRY TALES FOR 10 weeks! It was an english 104 class, NOT a fairy tale class. BUT EVERYTHING REVOLVED AROUND FAIRY TALES. She was miserable, her class was miserable, and her portfolio assignments were miserable.  AND YOU CAN'T WRITE AND USE THE WORD IS (or any verb that is &quot;being&quot;) ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a good attitude and wants her students to do well.She does not believe in excused abstances, ever, but don't let that scare you off. She grades pretty easy and when she doesn't just tell you what you did wrong, but also how to fix it. She's one of the better english teachers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2008<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Leah is a spectacular teacher!

Her class isn't very difficult or anything, but I had huge problems with the whole workshopping format. It doesn't really teach you anything useful about writing and seemed like a waste of an hour most days.

For EVERY paper u write u bring in your rough draft for the whole class to comment on. This method forces u to write a great rough draft cuz u know everyone is going to see it so its basically a final copy. Esentially, u turn in this final copy then take it home to re-write. What other teacher would do that&#63;!&#63;!&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher.  Classes absolutely pointless because amost every single day is workshopping.  If you miss just one class, your grade drops 5 percent.

This is college. She is a teacher. Accept that making an argument doesn't consist of slapping together 5 paragraphs, but logic. What a bunch of whiners.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Leah is a funny teacher that really understand college freshman, there's a lot of reading but the books arent bad and the assignments were pretty easy for the most part. she lets u rewrite your papers and is always willing to help. overall great teacher, i really liked her class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2006<br>Class Name: HON10<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a really cool teacher. she is funny and witty and is altogether good. she knows what she is talking about and will help you whenever you ask her for help</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class, she is very well informed, and very good at giving advice at writing.

She can be ****y if you give her a reason too. Her assignments are somewhat repetative and usually pretty boring to do. Sometimes class seems like it goes on forever.
