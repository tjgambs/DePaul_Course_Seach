He bases his tests on online homework problems and optional practice assignments, so if you do those you should do fine. He really wants you to learn and makes himself available for you if you need help. Not interested in learning physics&#63; Then take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: PHY151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Father Milton is a great professor.  He has a goofy sense of humor and acts a like a cartoon character sometimes but nonetheless he loves teaching physics.  He is a fair teacher bcz your grade is based off HW points, Labs, Midterm, Final & Quizzes.  Quizzes are based mostly off the hw probs which make them easy and the MT & FN are do-able. Take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2007<br>Class Name: PHY150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fr. Milton is a nice, caring man. Nonetheless, I was frustrated by his teaching techniques. Particularly, at the beginning of the quarter. He loves to demostrate and apply physics to real life scenarios. Lectures at times were confusing and boring since he never showed complete sample problems. However, he is willing to answer any homework question</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: PHY150151152<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is awesome.

Milton rocks! He is so nice, understanding, and he really makes physics fun. I loved taking this class with him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2005<br>Class Name: PHY150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fr.

He doesn't really lecture, he does experiments to help you visualize what you read for a better understanding.  He is VERY helpful and UNDERSTANDING!  AWESOME teacher!  I really recommend him for Physics.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: PHY151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I &lt;3 Jmil. He is such a nice guy and he cracks lots of jokes (too bad most ppl dont laugh at them).  He practically gives away the test and quiz answers...if you come to class. The class is very easy, do your homework and do farely well on tests, quizzes, and labs, and you should get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2005<br>Class Name: PHY150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor, cute old man that is only concerned with you getting an A in the class. I never took physics before and he made the class enjoyable and interesting.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
