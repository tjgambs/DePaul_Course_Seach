He gives a good amount of extra credit which can come in handy if you happen to miss an assignment deadline (he is very strict about these). But his lectures are fantastic.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2015<br>Class Name: 105305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He goes through the material way to fast in order to learn. It seems that Im more focused in taking the notes down rather that learning it because he goes speeds through the lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Torres' abnormal psych class was one of the best classes I have taken in psych at DePaul. He was willing to help with questions about assignments, readings, and papers. He was also super helpful to talk to about graduate school in psychology. Lots of reading, participation and attendance is mandatory. Highly recommend his class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>If you don't participate, he will give you a zero. The participation grade is worth 50 points and attendance is worth an extra 25 points. If you submit any work even a minute late (papers, online exams) he will not grade them. I would imagine he give you a letter grade reduction at least, but not. He is good teacher, but this isn't grad school.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As many say, he is a tough grader but fair. There are three online quiz and each quiz covers at least 7 chapters so it's better to prepare enough (all study guides are posted early). Also, there are 10 optional quiz which worth 50 points so you can pass the class even though the class is tough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Torres came off as intimidating at first, but I quickly realized that this is the kind of professor DePaul needs. He is challenging and expects your best work; at the same time, the lectures were always incredibly interesting. Wonderful to meet with during office hours. My gripe is that exams relied too heavily on regurgitating the textbook</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2014<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can tell he is really passionate about what he does, which really keeps you engaged in class. He's a tough grader and expects a lot from his students, but keep up with the readings and you'll do fine. Study a lot for the tests too since they're over like 11 chapters.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2014<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Torres isn't the easiest teacher but he's passionate about what he does, which makes the class so much more interesting. Don't take this class if you're looking to get an easy A because this class really does require a lot of work, but it's very worth it. He's a very nice man and always willing to help you understand.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2014<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For an intro class, he was way too hard and I'm a student with a good work ethic. He's really strict when it comes to the rules in the syllabus, absolutely no leniency. I didn't appreciate his attitude and always felt like he was condescending. Don't take him for the intro class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2014<br>Class Name: INTROPSYCH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>I wish people would stop complaining about having to work hard and not have your hand held by Dr. Torres.  Wake up!  You are in college. Want hand holding?  Go back to high school. This prof has high expectations and I really appreciated this. He respects his students, is willing to meet with them often and sure does know his stuff!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2014<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Torres is extremely knowledgeable and is very passionate. He expects you to work hard and attend every class. He is a hard grader, but makes his expectations here. I learned A LOT in his class, and would definitely recommend him. He is a great guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Dr Torres. He's absolutely an expert in his field. But, he isn't very understanding of freshmen. He should be teaching grad classes only. His assignments are tough and challenging but very beneficial</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Torres is very uptight with attendance, so if you plan on skipping do not take his class. He is very qualified and passionate about what he is teaching. Although he gives out very strict assignments and is not lenient or understanding about if you don't follow his directions completely.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2013<br>Class Name: 110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, avoid if you can. Nice guy but not really. Rude in criticism over things not even associated with the course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Torres is a nice guy, but he's a very bland lecturer. His homework assignments take hours on end to complete because he gives out simple writing prompts with length requirements that are too long. He seems better suited to teach graduate courses rather than freshman classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Try to avoid taking him. Although he is nice as a person, he expects way too much out of you, especially if you're a freshman. He takes things way too seriously and is very unclear on his assignments. He expects you to know everything already.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2013<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Torres has the best intentions but neglects to recognize that the science of psychology is not the law of the land. If you have a passing interest in psych or are trying to determine if it's for you take a different teacher. If psych is all there is to life for you, then this is the class for you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He definitely knows his stuff! He's a tough grader, you just need to learn what he's looking for as far as papers go. Also, exams were pretty tough, use the study guide he gives you and study hard! I got a low B the first test, but got a 101 on the final! You will learn how he grades as the class goes on. I recommend him, you'll learn A LOT.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2013<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The entire class reminded me of high school in terms of busy work. Online quizes, journal entries, and many more pointless assignment.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2012<br>Class Name: PSY302<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is awesome. His class is hard, but everything that you learn you can use in real life, unlike any other courses in my college career. He makes you reflect and use critical thinking. Isn't that what we go to school for? Don't be scared by the amount of work it is all worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2012<br>Class Name: PSY302<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Torres is a great professor. All of the class material can be applied to everyday life, unlike many other courses taken in my college career. He is hard but it is because he wants you to learn. Take this course if you want to learn something practical.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: PSY302<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What do you people expect? You're in college now! Of course you have to read the friggin book!  Prof Torres was awesome and direct. His teaching style is very creative and he allows students to discuss topics in a way that makes sense to them.  I appreciated his teaching so much, I'm keeping the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: PSY302<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite teacher at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2012<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Torres needs a wake up call. Not everyone is a psychology major and this isn’t grad school. His lectures are useless and boring, to pass the class you have to read the book from cover to cover. Attendance is mandatory and he is extremely biased. He came off as pompous and rude. I would NOT recommend taking his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2012<br>Class Name: PSY367<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendance is a must. Lectures are pointless but his review sheets for the midterm and final are great for outlining your studying. He is extremely unfair when it comes to technology problems, he relies on D2L too much. He's biased, yet if you get to know him, he's a great guy. Participate in class and show interest and you'll get at least a B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2012<br>Class Name: PSY367<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Class but Attendance is mandatory so if you can't get to class on time don't take this class.Assignment are given one class before they are due.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2011<br>Class Name: PSY000<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was really disappointed in most aspects of the class.  I liked that he brought up real-life case studies and had us try to figure out DSM classifications, but that was the only good part.  His lectures were pointless, as the notes and lecture were straight from the book with no added value.  His grading was overly harsh for no good reason.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought professor Torres was a great professor, but the class structure was not easy. The grade was based on 3 tests, an article review and I don't remember what else...but not much if anything. The point is, if you're a bad test-taker or paper-writer you will be nervous. However, I still thought he was great otherwise.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2011<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Meh. I'm a psych major and don't recommend this class. Granted, I took it for three hours Tuesday nights but it was boring. You basically just sit there and watch him read slides for 3 hours. He was okay, not the nicest and wouldn't respond to emails which was lame.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's alright, not great. He doesn't respond to your emails, which was pretty difficult to deal with. Lectures are bland but the tests are pretty easy if you're well prepared.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's just plain ok. He does go over material very quickly. All quizzes are pop quizzes, but as long as you do good on the review paper, you can get a B and never open the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a nice guy but didnt interact with his students enough.

I didn't like this at first but I realized that this is what college is all about. I am a freshman and this class was a good way of learning how to be a college student.  I recommend Professor Torres but tell him to slow down.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2008<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy knows his stuff, but I wish he would slow down.  Very fair and professional.  I felt like someone was treating my like an adult for the first time at this school.

Use a lot of Powerpoint.  Course would be better with more discussion.  This is a good intro class, but you are going to have to work.  I would take another of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2008<br>Class Name: PSY303<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For being a general elective class he graded and taught this class as if it were a senior course.  Not even my senior major courses graded as hard as he did.  Lot's of homework and difficult exams. The class average on three exams were no more than 55% and doesn't curve.  Doesn't post lectures and speeds thru them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2007<br>Class Name: PSY303<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY vague!! Do not take!!

His lectures ARE straight from the book and far from dynamic. He constantly tells personal stories, which doesn't really seem relevant to the study of Human Development (we should be learning scientifically supported facts, not anectdotes). Everyone performed worse in this class than any of their others...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2007<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Some of the below comments may be more relevant to higher level courses. In PSY 106, he was pretty fair on grading. The tests were a little challenging, but if you put a lot of effort into studying you will be fine. He teaches the class very well. You never really lose interest in either the presentations or readings. Recommended for PSY 106.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2007<br>Class Name: PSY303<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is the worst instructor I've ever had.  His lectures involve reading DIRECTLY from the text.  He is very unapproachable and seemingly narcisstic.  His expectations for students are much higher than should be expected from an instructor who obviously puts so little time and effort into the course.  Also, the class AVERAGE is an &quot;F&quot;.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2007<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>class average on the midterm was 45%..no curve. To compensate for his incredibly tough grading he offers  extra credit. He expect students to know ALL material, yet does not post his notes online and goes through his power point WAY to fast. Lots of homework, midterm, research project, final. Helpful if you go for help though. Nice man, bad teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2007<br>Class Name: PSYMETH<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the worst teacher i ever took! he expects you to know everything. for the final apa style paper, he expected us to know exactly how to do it all with little to no help. everyone was lost in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2007<br>Class Name: PSY213<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HARD grader!!! Make sure you know how to use MLA style proficiently,very anal about this!!  His quizzes are very tough!! The class was fun but the essays and quizzes are pretty tough.
