She is really down to earth and you won't have any surprises with her.  If you don't know the material, go to class.  Just get your work done and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2007<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>From what I understand, this class with her is a lot harder than the others but if you really want to have hands-on basic website design training, take Prof. Dettori.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2007<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Dettori is a boon to DPU and the students she mentors. Although she (literally) rescued me from some abysmal advising, she was tough enough to flunk me when I deserved it (I passed the 2nd time around). If you're looking for an easy A, she isn't it. If you're looking to get your $ worth, then step on up.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2006<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>it's not fair to judge her like that. She's very very good prof. and very helpful. Im a marketing major, never learn java before. but i still got an A. Of course, the homework are not very easy but it help me to understand more about JAVA. BTW, she's very patient, super paticent. Strongly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lucia is wry, funny, and excited about databases. Homework assignments were some of the larger ones I've seen at DePaul--but she's a fair (even gracious) grader. Numerous possibilities for extra credit. She seemed overwhelmed, and often couldn't grade assignments in a timely manner. Overall, a great teacher, best out of the 4 I've had so far.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take her! Super fast, hard to follow. Not helpful unless you are doing well in her class/Midterm. Assignment are confusing. Assignments/ Midterm are way too hard for non-programmer students. Hard to get extra credit from her. Drop her as soon as you get this message.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2005<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing command of the database languages (yes, plural).  Extremely helpful, and her main interest is in helping your learn.  All you have to do is put in the effort - Amazing teacher at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2005<br>Class Name: ADVISING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had her as an advisor helping me with my Graduate Schedule.  Definitely SUPER helpful.  She's a great person.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: DATABASES<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is paced for people who got a good understanding of Java in CSC 211.  Assignments can be a little confusing, but there is no question she wont help you with and she makes herself very available.  She is very cool, but because of the subject matter, the class demands alot.  Dont take it if you arent prepared to work!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2005<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this class. Hard/fast paced class. She isn't always clear on assignments.  I went to her for help and she insisted I drop the class. not encouraging at all. made me feel like garbage.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>&quot;DR.&quot; Dettori is (IMO) the BEST instructor I've ever had @ DePaul. She actually CARES how well the student does and goes to GREAT lengths to help. Even @ 2AM! :) Google up her work! She should be at CERN or FERMI, not babysitting us...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2004<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm sorry, but if you have no programming experience , please do not take her. A lot of work envolved, and a lot of hard material she expects students to learn, which she thinks is easy. Easy for her, but might not be for others! And she is not HOT!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2004<br>Class Name: CSC319<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of work involved. I'd say way too much compared to other 300 level courses.  You dont even learn that much. I mean, its a DB class and we didnt even do DROP TABLE. We didnt even use a real DB server, just Access! She can teach though.  She also suffers badly from PowerPoint excess.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: CSC315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took a Database course. It was Hard Work, lectures got boring, but not too hard.A REALLY helpful personality who is VERY accepting.What else can u expect from an Italian who married an Indian.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2004<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher! Knows her material inside-out. Very very very helpful. She almost opens your brain and inserts information in it - that good! Offers lots of extra credit. If you really wannt to learn material, take her class. She's the best!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2004<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have no idea what is Java, Don't take it with her! btw, she is nice.... but i'm just talking about her personlity,not the homework and exam.Her homework and projects are very confusing.if u are not a IS major, don't take it with her, unless u want to try & get how it feels to get a C- easily.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2004<br>Class Name: CSC319<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2004<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is by far the best professor at Depaul. Her course material is very challenging (for a non-programmer), however, you definitely get what you pay for and come out of the class with an excellent understanding of Java.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2004<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HARD...if you don't have programming experience your screwed!

The second half is a tad bit harder, but she takes things to a easy pace. Reccomend her over anyone else for CSC319.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2004<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor. I learned a lot from the class, as she did everything she could to make sure people understood. The class would only be hard if you never went to class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2003<br>Class Name: CSC319<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers I have ever had...definitely take her if you have the chance!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2003<br>Class Name: ECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awwwwwwweeeeeesommme teacher!
