The way she runs this cours is terrible; everyone sits in a circle and MUST participate in a silly roudtable discussion every class (whether you want to or not). If you skip 2 classes you fail! Moreover, she requires 30h of community service. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: CSS310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I haven't taken a philosophy course with her, but her course on restorative justice through her Inside-Out Exchange, which is taught in a prison with inmates, is mind-blowing and a must have experience for anyone who wants to go into social justice. If you want to change your perspective on our justice system, TAKE THIS CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2014<br>Class Name: PHL250<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>It is easy to earn an A when the class could be taught to first graders! Not only are her lectures remedial, she even treats you like a child! I have never felt so insulted by a professor. Prepare for her snickering if she doesn't like your answer! Definitely an easy A but the hard part is not wanting to take a W and get out of that class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2013<br>Class Name: CSS310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its college people! If you cant handle Prof. Moe maybe you should go to a community college. She doesn't hand feed you the information and expects you to do the work and try your best. If you need help she will help. Sometimes she can be confusing but what professor isn't. She has a passion for restorative justice. Take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2012<br>Class Name: PHILO100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone who doesn't like Ms. Moe stupid and doesn't care. Yes, somethings are true (attend. & particp) but, this is a University & I think she pushes students in a positive direction. Show up, participate, do "your" best, and for the record she scales the grading to what you learn. "you start here and I want to see improvement whatever that is."</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very fussy if you are not on time and does not like if you leave. Her tutorial papers you read to her are brutal; she gives no real guidelines for them and then just rips you apart. She says some interesting stuff in discussion but will spend 3 classes talking about the same thing. Wouldn't recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awful teacher. Do not ever take her. She makes you go read your papers to her and she will criticize you and tear you apart right then and there. Insanely boring teacher. If she notices you don't have your book she'll call on you to read just to embarrass you and use you as an example. She is a horrible teacher and a horrible person. AVOID HER</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2011<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly cannot believe this woman is still teaching at DePaul--absolutely unfit and a terrible representation of DePaul's faculty. She should go back to the community college where she came from. Does not deserve the salary of a private university. students should not be forced to take her class on racism and judged for thinking outside of the box</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2010<br>Class Name: CSS201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Insanity.  Spends the first half hour of every class rambling and taking attendance.  Changes expectations throughout and pretends they were presented earlier.  Grading system arbitrary.  Encourages discussion, but will cut students down until they finally parrot the points from the reading she wants to hear.  Never had such a bad class at Depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Welll....during the time of class she had family issues but she still didn't give clear notes, I kinda thought she did nothing but drink but at the same time she seemed like she cared a lot about the subject...but our view points meant nothing to her..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2009<br>Class Name: PHL250<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does not hand out assignments so you can not even argue your grade but what she predetermined at the beginning of the quarter. Also she uses technology but does not understand how to use it. Last but not least her syllabus says it all, she reserves the right to lower or raise the grade based on &quot;performance&quot;&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: PHL201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The person below said it best. This woman is a total wackjob. She has predetermined grades based on how much you suck up to her and how much you act like you care about what she is saying. She doesnt hand back any assignments and has no sense of reality. she thinks the class is your whole life and nothing outside of it is important. DONT TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: PHIL250<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid at all costs.  She is NUTS- She has no idea what she is teaching about because the idea is so ludicris- The class is soo much work, Read every day, 5 text books to buy, outside meetings, 25 serive hours, class everyday, and a 3 hour workshop- she is insane. Never take her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2008<br>Class Name: BUS200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really loved Professor Moe's class. If you are truly interested in the subject I think you will really get a lot from her and her teachings. She is interested in each and every student and willing to meet with you one on one. The class is not easy at all- but if you are willing to work and think outside of the box she's great!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is unfit to teach. Not only does she simply love to hear herself talk, but cuts off students before they can make a point. She doesn't care about students input but expects them to participate. I had a 95% in the class and she gave me an A-. How does that equate&#63; Well, considering she thinks 4 + 4 is 16, I guess I can see.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2007<br>Class Name: SOPHSEM<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OK, SO THE GUY WHO WROTE THAT HE GOT 0% ON HIS QUIZ IS TELLING THE TRUTH. WE WERE IN THE SAME CLASS TOGETHER. BASICALLY IF SHE DOES NOT LIKE YOU, YOU WILL FAIL.SHE GIVES TOO MUCH READING, 2MANY PAPERS TO WRITE- OUR FINAL WAS 10 PAGES(PAPER)YES YES. IF YOU ARE WILING TO MAKE THIS CLASS CENTER OF UR WORLD, TAKE HER. SHE IS NICE, BUT GIVES TOO MUCH HW</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2007<br>Class Name: HUM120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher!

I never thought I'd rate a professor on this site until I took this lady's class. I cannot comprehend her thought process on grading to this day. She falsely accused me of plagiarism and lectured me on how I would be penalized on future work because my answers were &quot;unique&quot;. Seriously, don't take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class was very difficult mainly because she did not explain what was expected from you in the class. The reading was fine but because everyone at DePaul has to take this class for their undergrad, the classes are overcrowded and the class can drag on when one student does not understand something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2007<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HER CLASS WAS ACTUALLY INTERESTING. REALLY MAKES YOU THINK. DID A LOT OF READING OUT OF TEXT AND OTHER BOOKS BUT IT WAS QUITE INTERESTING. ONLY THING I HATED WERE THE ETHICS JOURNALS WHICH TOTAL TO 16 AND A 4 PAGE PERSONAL JOURNAL DUE AT END OF QUARTER ON THE NEW YORK TIMES. OVERALL, TAKE THE CLASS IF YOU WANT HER TO GET U THINKING ABOUT LIFE</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you had a worst professor in Depaul, you will change that professor it if you take her. Do yourself a favor, Do not take her. I'm an AVG 3.5 student, and I never had a worst teacher ever in my life as far as she concerned. Take someone else, If you take her you will suicide or make a hole in the wall. Take my advice: She is HORRIBLE!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2006<br>Class Name: PHY100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My #1 suggestion for this professor would be to talk to her after class. She can be a lot of help if you take advantage of it. I didnt until late in the class. Also, even though she comes off as very full of herself at first she's actually really down to earth.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We did a lot of reading but the readings definitely relate to the coarse and the topic of the class. You have a lot of projects to do that arn't due til the end of the quarter. I didn't like how I wasn't aware of what I was getting in this class until the final grade came out. But in the end it was fine and I learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!! She gives you more work than any other of the phl 100 classes.  And you hardly spend time talking about the actual topic.  The critical response you have to write at the end is horrible because there are no guidelines for it.  She is not nice or helpful. stay away!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really is not that bad.  There is a lot of reading for this class but it is very interesting and you actually learn something!  She can be boring at times, but she really does care...she wants you to think and do well. If you participate in class and ask her questions (be visible) you will do good.

Does like to talk. U must participate and raise questions. U write a few papers, watch some films. She's a nice instructor and cares, u can talk to her about your grade. Can be fun if you participate, we had a very good class this qtr, it was fun and thought provoking-it's philosophy, what do u expect&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very difficult. Prof does not tell you exactly what you want and there are no guidelines. Goes off on a lot of wild tangents and class is hard to follow. LOTS of reading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away! This teacher is ridiculous! You read everything you had to read at home again in class and then read your paper out loud in class. At the end you can't even make sense of your own notes! I was doing terrible on every paper and finally I just asked her what I was doing wrong and she said &quot;I don't know&quot;. If she doesn't know, who does!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of reading but overall it was not hard since the books were interesting. I got an A-.  The only hard task was the project but even that wasn't that hard.

She said philosophy is about questioning, but if you did, she did not respect them.  If you make notes and put them in the paper, you will get A, if you do not then she will tell you &quot;we need to talk&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Moe,Dominica Kimberley is a joke, (I really can't believe there are teachers like this at DePaul) she doesn't teach the class, she has her students read out loud in class like we are in elementary school because she lacks a real understanding of the material and she can't lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really likes to hear herself talk.  She encourages class discussion for your participation grade, then cuts you off to make her point.  This is not an ethics class at all, mostly a disorganized philosophy class.  The group project was a pain because she changed the requirements as she went along</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the worst class I have ever experienced!She is extremely boring and completely theatrical.
