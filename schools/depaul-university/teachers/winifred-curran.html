			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

In her lectures she was very articulate, clear, and witty. But! This class was so boring! The readings were absolutely awful and she would create long explanations that didn't seem to explain much.

I would try to avoid this class, I heard she was ok in others though</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2008<br>Class Name: GEO333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty pompous and a New York City elitist.  She feels that New York City is the only city on the planet.  Tough grader.  Very vague when it came to what she wanted from you in papers.  Loved the one kiss up in the class who went well over his presentation time.  I'm sure there are better profs out there.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2008<br>Class Name: GEO333<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was very interesting. I was able to gain a very good prospective on Urban life. It was fairly easy too, but it can be a lot of things going on at once. With two presentations, a final paper, and the affordable housing inventory/paper, it can be tedious. But Winnifred was fun, cool, and a good teacher overall. Just make sure you keep up!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2007<br>Class Name: GEO233<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>doesnt tell you at all what she expects on papers or tests.  then when she hands back the first paper, and everyone has D's and F's on it, she figures its all our fault and not her bad teaching.  assumes we know as much as her and if not that we are bad people for not knowing it.  dont take her please</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2007<br>Class Name: GEO233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is cool in my opinion and knows her stuff. She seems a but lazy though in my opinion. Btw get on her good side because is she likes you you will definately do well in her class.

All tests are directly from the text and most discussions where your notes come from do not cover all of that material. Highly recommend the class to all majors.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2007<br>Class Name: GEO233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Comparative Urbanism is one of the most interesting classes I've had at DePaul, and Dr. Curran's lectures are excellent.  She has no sympathy for people who don't do the reading, so if you're willing to crack down a bit and read an amazing book by Howard Berman, take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: GEO266<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>10 page research paper, 2 tests, fair amount of reading.

She was a good teacher, and really seemed to care about her studends.  She was very helpful with my final research paper. I also thought she was a fair grader.  The readings were interesting.  The class overall forced me to think about the world in a very different way.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: HON204<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow...

Also, be prepared for a lot of work that can get very tedious. Overall the class is very easy, but there is a lot of work that is involved.

She is so full of it, it's ridiculous.  Her grading is insane and she treated her students like we were a bunch a morons.
