Sometimes lectures can get a little boring, but if you really make yourself pay attention and participate, you'll get so much from the class. Quizzes and papers are very detail-oriented. If you're having trouble with anything, just ask him! He's so willing to help. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2015<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A wonderful teacher!! Very knowledgable and passionate about literature, and if you need help, he will be there for you. I am definitely planning on taking another one of his classes. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2015<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>If you're looking for your GPA to take a hit, this is for you. I'm not a slacker--I had a 3.9 before taking him. But he doesn't tell you what he wants on papers and offers a "word bank" of over 100 choices for a 12 question test. Good Luck.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2015<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed Mr. Williams Film & Lit class very much. He is extremely passionate  and knowlegeable about the material, and his literary insights are  impressive. He also makes himself available to students for extra help with assignments. A very kind man. I will definitely take him again! One of the best!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Williams is very passionate about what he teaches and he is a very sweet and kind individual. The quizzes we had were VERY disorganized. This could simply be a technology barrier as he does not seem well adapt with technology. I found the texts to be very confusing and lectures did not aid in providing clarification.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Williams is VERY passionate about what he teaches. The plays that we read in class were enjoyable, he gives really good analysis of what the plays are about and the hidden meaning behind the text. Go to class if you want to pass though, quizzes after each reading, but it was cool to watch the movie along with reading the book! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is extremely sweet, but lectures the entire period and puts me to sleep everyday. I never read in this class and I always get a C on the quizzes. I wish he gave homework or had more class participation. Most boring classing I have ever taken!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2013<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very passionate and nice man! You can tell he is an expertise when it comes to Shakespeare. I recommend this course to everyone because he is a nice and helpful man. He has a great sense of humor, which makes the class very interesting! The best professor ever and my favorite!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2012<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy but his quizzes ask random questions like favorite character's drink, etc. Kinda crazy. And paper format is very specific to what he prefers. He'll revise yours before the due date but if you are the type to type a paper the night before it's due, don't take the class! Otherwise, it's an okay class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Williams is wonderful. You read interesting pieces and you won't have a problem on the quizzes or papers if you read. He really wants you to succeed. Will do almost anything to help you out, even have a phone conversation about what was discussed in class if you miss class. Nice, friendly man. Taking him again next quarter :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2011<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Williams is SUCH a nice man. He is always happy and willing to help with anything a student needs. As long as you read what is assigned, you will have no problem with the quizzes or papers. I'm definitely going to take him for another English class in the future.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2011<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love him!! Professor Williams is a wonderful teacher,perhaps the best professor I've had at DePaul. His passion for Shakespeare is infectious and he is dedicated to helping his students understand the material and succeed in the class. Highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2011<br>Class Name: ENG256<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Williams is definitely a good-nature guy who loves his subject, but I found that the atmosphere of his class was a bit off. Be prepared for not-that-funny teacher jokes and a serious lack of student/teacher back-and-forth. An ok class but I wouldn't heartily recommend it</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2011<br>Class Name: SHAKESPEA<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was an absolutely wonderful teacher! He has so much passion for Shakespeare and it shows when he teaches. He will help you out so much with the papers, and he is really easy to talk to. He's a super fun, nice old man. I loved this class so much I'm taking another with him and I have just declared my minor as English Lit because of this class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2011<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love him! He was very entertaining, loves his own jokes.  Cute old man who tries really hard to get his students interested in the topics.  If you think about the papers and edit them so they're concise, you'll do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2010<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His passion for Shakespeare will inspire you, or at the very least, entertain you. It's nice to finally see a teacher with a real love for his class. You've got 2 papers, a take-home midterm and a final. He's incredibly nice, and always there to help.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2010<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!! Very nice and very enthusiastic about teaching. The class was NOT what I was expecting! Detailed quizzes on readings and papers are graded very tough. Easy midterm!!! Overall, I loved the teacher but had very little interest in what plays we coverd.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2010<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The passion in a professor is evident when they quote entire sections of every Shakespearean play from memory. Not only did he make the plays we read fun, he shared insight into the viewpoints of a range of critics that allowed for a wider breadth of understanding. I would definitely take a class with Michael Williams again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: ENG273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Noone took notes in that class but I did. If you take notes you can use those notes for the papers and you'll get an A. His quiz's ask detailed questions, like &quot;what is the guy's named who did so and so.&quot; But they are usually 10 questions and focus on main points. He is very passionate about the course. Great and nice guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Passionate is the right word! He got soo into the Shakespeare plays, fun to watch and easy to listen to! But you really Have to listen to him because he gives you the answers to the quizzes in lectures. If you READ and LISTEN impossible not to get an A. Get the No Fear Shakespeare books, they really help. If you email or call, he'll def help you</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was VERY passionate about the subject.  He did his best to explain Shakespeare and help everyone learn.  As long as you read and pay attention, you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2010<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Passionate and highly knowledgeable about his subject, Mr. Williams is one of the best professors I have had at DePaul. He invites you to love literature as much as he does and he truly cares about his students. An excellent teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2009<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Williams is very enthusiastic about his field of work. However, he should translate it more effectively to his students. Readings are only useful for quizzes, the final exam, and for writing two papers. In the future, he should encourage more in-class participation and give fewer lectures to make students feel that this class was worth while.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2008<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So much reading within 10 weeks, but all were easy and short. He is goofy, but very helpful. He does give answers to quiz questions and paper discussions during lectures, just pay attention. Don't miss any class and you are on your way for an easy B or an A, Fair grader, gives you chance to revise your paper.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Watch the movies.  Read the book .  Pay attention to what he talks about in class.  He gives weekly quizzes, but tells you what the answers will be prior to the quiz.  They take about 30 seconds to finish.  There's a midterm paper, final paper, and final too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2008<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE this man! It was an 8:30 class, so he didn't expect us to be perky and speak up a lot, but pay attention. It was &quot;world lit&quot; but it was just Shakespeare, the Greek tragedies, Phaedra, and Ibsen plays. He talks about everything before the quizzes, and the papers are pretty decently-defined. Ask questions; he will answer them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy. He knows his stuff and still actively watches plays and theatre. He recites lines from memory and basically reviews what you are about to have on a test 5 min before it. Do the reading which isn't difficult and do your best writing because that's the tough part of the class. Take it =)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Williams is easily one of my all-time favorite professors, at DePaul or elsewhere.  He is just a really genuine guy and I loved it when he started reciting lines from the plays we were doing from memory.  Really smart man and very personal.  TAKE HIS CLASS...HE IS BRILLIANT.  He appreciates people who write well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2006<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor rox! I read the plays and spark notes, which he promotes so we could understand the material.  Every play that we read he at least shows an excerpt to help us understand the material. The tests are ok, the quotes he uses to identify to a character are the ones he usually repeats in class. Overall great teacher made me appreciate shak</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Williams is a good guy. He is very enthusiastic about Shakespeare. There are five plays to read, and a fill in the blanks quiz for each.There are two short papers. I didn't buy any of the books and got A's and B's on my quizes by reading spark notes. He likes class participation, he shows movies. I would take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2006<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
