She is a genuinely nice woman, but her teaching style needs serious revamping.  Expect to spend $200 on books, and then read anywhere from 200-400 pages a week (a novel plus history text readings).  I thought the class would be easy with two take-home exams, but you have no idea what she expects on them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2005<br>Class Name: HST287<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Besides the fact that she assigns about 200 pages of reading a week, she'll give out pop quizzes if people don't read.  She has a tendency of being extremely boring, I'd rather watch a snail take a dump.  I have never dreaded going to class as much as I do with hers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2005<br>Class Name: HIST287<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>completely agree with the last review. she reads straight off of a sheet of paper and is reallly boring.  Assigns too much reading, but so far her grading has been managable and the tests are take home which is a plus.  As a teacher though, she pretty much stinks</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2005<br>Class Name: HST287<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor must be new or a graduate student... she reads her lecture notes from behind the podium and seems to not really understand anything she's saying. She assigns one novel a week which is rough. Needs more experience or something. Says UMMM about 5 million times during the hour and a half class. Can we say Public Speaking&#63;</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
