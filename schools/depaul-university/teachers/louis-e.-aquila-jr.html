			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

You will spend hours and hours practicing, but when you et to higher math classes you will thank him. I used to be horrible at math, and I got an A which is huge.

Not only is he very thorough and gives you good notes, all the &quot;Tests&quot; (it's actually graded homework assignments) are take home, midterm is take home, test is open note open book and based on the practice final which he gives you the answers for. You'd be stupid NOT to take him. Great prof!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is old fashioned, but i understand what he teaches. I hate math, only through him have i been able to pass my math classes. I took him for bms 125/126 and i get a better grade each class. I am taking him again in bms 142.
