Get ready to teach yourself advanced finance.  How this guy is teaching a 300 level class is a mystery to me.  Homework every week, and you get no help and never go over it.  Get used to the book, because you will be teaching yourself.  Just rambles in class-teaching nothing.  Very hard midterm and final, but huge curve cuz he cant teach</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible Professor ! You basically have to teach the material to yourself, and I am not joking. He cannot teach, seriously !! Mid-term and Final are very hard, sometimes not corresponding with anything from the notes or homework. Homework is lengthy, but he does curve, oh he does curve your mid-term and finale. 59% = B or C (don't remember) No Help</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I have ever had at DePaul.  He does not know how to teach and should be fired.  I am amazed that he is still around, DePaul must not read their surveys because EVERYONE I talked to in his class with me thought he should be fired.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, I'll be honest...Professor Smith may not be the greatest, but he's got style.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a waste! Horrible class - great subject..... I am a finance major and I had to teach the material to myself!&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly doubt that Prof. Smith will be teaching again at DePaul. His teaching skills, if you can call it that, are worth about 12$ of your money.  Sometimes I wonder if DePaul interviews new Professors. DePaul University, You F'ed me and probably everyone else that enrolled in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>don't take him, it's his first year at depaul and quite possibly his first year teaching ever.  his class lecture is nondirective and never goes anywhere.  if you take night class you will not get a break and class will not let out early.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is HORRIBLE.  Nothing he covers in class is useful nor does it relate to the homework or tests.  Only take him if you can teach yourself Finance, and even then, he assigns homework and marks attendance.  Don't expect him to return your e-mails or phone calls either.  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is a complete idiot. He reads from the book for the entire class. He doesn't give breaks in the night class. He doesn't come prepared with notes. He's inexperienced and he has a difficult time articulating the solutions/answers to question. GET OUT OF CLASS!!! This is a self-teach class! AVOID THIS FOOL!!!!!!!!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
