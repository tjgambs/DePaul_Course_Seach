			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

Very easy because of the format - no tests, weekly readings enforced by online quizzes, and 35% of the grade was in-class participation. I feel like I did learn from it, but I still can't take it seriously as a grad level course. Same for Dekleva.

Buy the PDF version of the book, run OCR text recognition if needed, this will allow you to search for terms on the quizzes.  The cases are wildly outdated which is annoying for an IT type class.

VERY EASY class. I was worried because I am not really a computer guy and this is an IT class. This class isn't really about hardcore computer programming its more of a liberal arts class. A lot of talking about current events and busy work to help you puff up your grade. NO mid term or final. Good class to take w/ECO555</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2012<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent. Definitely one of my favorite teachers so far. I liked the class because it wasn't simply a huge midterm and exam, but instead he encourage conversations. Also, there will individual writes ups and other small projects. Pretty much if you put effort into the class you can EASILY get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2012<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent.

There are 10 minute online quizzes to complete before each class and postings on D2L. 1 short presentation - no midterm or final. Highly recommend Delkeva for MIS555!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2011<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a lot of reading in this class. If do the reading, you will do fine. There is no midterm or final exam but there are (small) quizzes each week based on the readings.

One nice thing is that you don't have midterm or final only daily quizzes along with a lot of reading, 4 articles and 1 presentation.

But the class is worthless, the timed quizzes are silly, and overall way class is conducted leads to redudant conversation about topics that are water cooler talk.

Easy to keep up with and manageable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class has a lot of busy work to it but it is very manageable.  35% of your grade is class participation but it isn't hard to make a couple comments every class. The workload isn't bad and there is no midterm or final. Prof has a knowledge of the subject matter and keeps discussions open.  Not hard to do well if you keep up with the work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2008<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  Yes is a lot of work; lost of reading, weekly quiz, 5 IT article reviews & Q&A web discussions. The instructor is very good and the class format is open forum thus participation is a must.  Presentations are required and I agree w/ someone else?s post who stated it is painful.  If you are having issues talk to him, he will listen.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is a waste of money and time - but it's required. Dekleva believes that IT is the most important function of a business which is clear in the 10 minutes that he actually lectures in class. Participate or don't expect an A. This class is painful to sit through.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2008<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty worthless class overall but not hard by any stretch of the imagination. Quizzes reference minute details in the reading.  Since all quizzes are taken online, outline each chapter for quick reference, you dont necessarily have to actually read them. You must go to class for participation points since they represent the majority of your grade</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2008<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the worst class of all the courses I have taken at Depaul. Complete waste of money. Did not learn a single thing. The grades depend on how frequently you participate not at all on the quality. Just keep talking. His weekly quizzes are useless. I will avoid him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Materials are outdated.  Book is one of the worst.  Weekly quizzes test obscure points.  A is a given but only if you participate.  Lectures are chaotic and presentations are sometimes painful to sit through.  Sasha tries but just seems out of touch with the students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is just bad.  Avoid him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seems fairly out of touch.  All class materials are at least 10 years old and out of date.  ALOT of reading with quizzes that reference minute details in the reading.  You must attend and you must participate!!  No midterm/final.  Overall I didn't learn much, especially for the amount I had to read.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Material and class are somewhat boring. A lot of reading, quizes every week. No mideterm and final. Participation in class counts towards your grade. He was ok.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher as long as you participate actively and attend class.  Weekly quizzes are tough</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a disscussion based class and at first there is a ton of reading it eventually evens out and is really a very interesting class. Those with a little bit of IT background seem to add more to disscusion but everyone can add something. This is a great class and pretty easy going prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lackluster in every way.  Unaware and dismissive of acknowledged trends.  Uninspired treatment of essential concepts.  DePaul has better to offer.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared for a lot reading.But if you have a technology background you have advantage in this class. It will show why you remain employed a lot students in the MBA program are technology defecient. Very organized class  he is Passionate about what he is teaching!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2006<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy knows what he's talking about, this is just a bad and boring class.  No lecture structure, TONS of reading, and the class leads the discussions - sometimes the prof might as well not even be there.  I was hoping for a bit more for my $$.  No mid-term or final, just weekly quizzes, a presentation, and a few homework assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2006<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved him.  Ya... the book was dry.  Lots of reading.  But if you read you can do above average on the weekly quiz.  Hey, they're better than a midterm and final, that you have to know chapter upon chapter.  You will definitely learn.  Extremely easy to talk to and friendly.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared for a lot of reading.  Online weekly quizzes on the textbook and case - the questions asked are tricky and very specific about say one sentence in the 50 page chapter. But like another posted said, the majority of the grade is from class participation.  In a class of 30-40 students you really have to fight to get a word in.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2005<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>alot of work but no midterm or final...as long as you do the homework you'll get an A...nice guy too</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2005<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class - structured differently (35% participation and 25% on weekly quizes on text and case study - no midterm or final). If you say something - anything (no matter how dumb) it counts positively toward participation (so be prepared for many dumb comments and fighting for attention in a larger class).  Overall positive experience.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
