The class is relatively easy. You learn Pro Tools. He'll rant and go on tangents and tell funny stories. He could teach a class on beer. He always ends class with "remember, your parents love you, but I don't." He gives you several classes to work on the final project, which is essentially the final exam</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2015<br>Class Name: DC215<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great guy personally, but not a very good teacher. He knows what he is talking about (he works with sound), but wastes most of the class time talking about pointless stuff and then rushes through the material too fast to understand. Thankfully he puts tutorials online that are easier to follow. Thinks he's really funny. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2014<br>Class Name: DC215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've had at DePaul! My major requires specific electives so I took this one and I'm glad I did. I definitely had no knowledge on sound design but Derek is really helpful! He's also funny/interesting which makes the class go by pretty fast. Homework and grading is easy if you finish your stuff. I'd take him again for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: DC113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Derek is such a fun and laid back person. I knew nothing about podcasts going in, and he made it extremely fun and clear. As long as you put effort into your podcasts and papers, you will do just fine. Really enjoyed this course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2013<br>Class Name: DC215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class consists of half jokes and half learning about sound. You will learn a lot from him; he really knows his stuff.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
