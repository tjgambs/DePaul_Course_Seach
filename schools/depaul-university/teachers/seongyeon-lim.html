Also, she has a huge attitude problem. I emailed her asking her for help and her response was useless. I guess u can take her, but beware, her exams are tricky. She'll always pull something on u.

As pointed out in other ratings, Dr. Lim has an accent.  I did not find this distracting in the least.

That said, she does not know how to teach. She kinda has an attitude and enjoys playing the 'tough' professor role.

She gives about 5-7 homework questions each day.  Do them because she might call on you for the answer.  She likes to call on people she knows are frequently absent/don't do the HW. Finally, she gives review guides for each exam.  Know these and you'll do well and LEARN A LOT!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She wants everyone to know their stuff.

Her lectures are detailed and she tried really hard to explain everything thoroughly. Gives homework that is challenging but prepares you for the exams. Practice exams help. Grade is based on 3 exams which means you need to study. Avaliable for outside help.

But if you just need to get Finance 310 out of the way, and can apply yourself a little bit, you can easily pull off a B. She curves everything, so non-finance majors, its a guaranteed pass.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does try hard to help, but unfortunately that is not good enough.   FIN majors, I would suggest taking someone else because you REALLY won't take anything from this class- she is very hard to understand so learning concepts doesn't really work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She SPEAKS NO ENGLISH!!!FOB...Looks petrified when she teaches and has to curve the class by 20 points in order for students to pass...avoid this teacher!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She konw her stuff, but when you ask her to explain something she does not do a goo job. Her voice is really soft,n hardly hear her half the time in class. If you want to pass, you really have to understand the formula and concepts and do homework.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible!! She does not explain well at all. She goes through 2 chapters in one class session.

However, I got an A becasue of the huge curve.  The class went from 30 to 13 after the first test.

I ended up with an A because of the HUGE curve she had, but as said that shows how badly people did-- take someone else if you can and buy a fin. calc. it'll save your but!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think she is a really intellegent teacher but cannot really express.However like the ratings says i dont think she is that bad.

Can not understand what she is saying.  Worst Teacher (even though i'm getting an A).  You have to literally teach yourself.

She gives huge curves though...midterm we got 23 point curve but it shows how hard her midterms can be.
