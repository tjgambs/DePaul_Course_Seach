This foreign born prof. has more knowledge and understanding of the US political system (+ the same in a global sense) than most nat. born citizens. He is refreshing and inspiring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2010<br>Class Name: MULTICULT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He speaks slowly, his English is completely incomprehensible and his handwriting is awful. Easy grader. The class itself was totally useless. Very nice guy, but not a good professor at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: PSC328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy and very knowledgeable. You have to work hard in the class, but getting an A is doable. We had two 10-page papers and one 20-pager which was difficult but again, doable. If you're interested in what he's teaching, take him. Warning: He can be a bit boring during lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2009<br>Class Name: HIST328<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Notice all of the negative reviews come from the children taking the 100 level class.  Dr Adeoye is extremely knowledgeable, clearly communications information, and makes the class very interesting.  If you're looking for a blowoff class, or you're not interested in political science, don't take him.  If you take the subject seriously, you'll love</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2008<br>Class Name: POLYSCI<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG. 1. you can NOT understand him 2. HE IS SO BORING 3. I WORKED HARD AND ENDED UP WITH A B! He doesnt know how to teach AT ALL.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2008<br>Class Name: PSC225<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a decent professor. A bit boring but he liked me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Adeoye is not a good professor at all. It is difficult to understand him some of the time and his handwriting is terrible. He was rude and didn't teach much. I would never suggest taking him, especially for political science classes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most misleading grader I've ever taken. Got rave reviews and grades in the high 90's throughout the term and magically came out with a B. Learned absolutely nothing, but had to take notes all class. Terrible experience, DO NOT TAKE. Amen below.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2008<br>Class Name: PSC232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Professor Adeoye for several courses.  He incorporates the readings well into the class.  It is easy to do well in his class if you attend, read the material, and participate in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2008<br>Class Name: PSC323<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't believe these ratings! Dr. Adeoye is a clear, concise professor who gets his points across. He encourages discussion and participation, rather than talking at the students every class-meeting. He respects everybody's opinion and shows no biases, and is very capable of relating political matters with real-world and current examples.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: POLI120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed his class.  I did not find him unclear, he was extremely helpful, and not on an ego trip.  I would recommend his class!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really didn't teach me anything I didn't know but then again it is a 100 level class. He was an easy grader and I never read a page in the class and aced the midterm and final. If your looking for an easy A I recommend this class but if you want to learn something I wouldn't recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy has no business teaching anyone anything. he is horrible and doesn't know what hes talking about. dont take him if you really want to learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: PSC218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't believe my eyes! I thought Adeoye was a terrific professor. This class finally got me to read the newspaper and understand what was going on in the world-now I finally understand politics. He was funny and easy going and an easy grader. I would DEFINITELY reccomend Adeoye.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy grader, picks favorites...VERY difficult to understand sometimes, sit close to the board b/c his handwriting to damn near impossible to read, reading not necessary. Any consolation, he does have a good sense of humor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher. You can't understand what he's saying b/c of his crazy accent and his handwriting is terrible. Didn't seem to know what he was talking about EVER. Ask him a political questions that an elementary school kid could answer and he just dumbly says &quot;that's a good question&quot; and moves on. I would not suggest taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2006<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he sucks! he is the worst teacher ever! you will learn nothing. he is not smart. he is dumb as hell. dont take him. hes a very easy grader unlesss he doesn't like you, i never took notes and always laughed at him because of how dumb he is so he graded me unfairlly. he sucks. i got all A's in all my other classes but this pointless one</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Professor is very boring, talks slow but he is very nice and means well. Go to class, take notes. That is literally every class, no surprises, no homework other than reading assignments that don't matter until the final or midterm. EASY grader however the final was surprisingly difficult, a lot of material we did not cover in class, so read!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE SUCKS. you won't learn ANYTHING! its like taking civics in high school, but easier.  Just go to class sometimes. do the assigned homework and  you'll do fine! don't need to do the reading! and dont really need to take notes! i have not read one page of the book nor do i take notes and ill prolly get an A- or B+ VERY BORING TEACHER!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
