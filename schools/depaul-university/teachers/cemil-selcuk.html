He is not very personable, but explains always if someone asks or has a problem understanding. Attend class, you will have a quiz every time and this is part of your grade. Personally the final was easier than midterm, but many not be true for u</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough class but he allows for open book midterm and quizzes, which make it managemable</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super easy...it scares you when you realize he has a thick accent BUT the &quot;quizzes&quot; are just 5 multi choice ques taken from the practice quizzes he posts on blackboard...his midterm and exam are 40 multi choice ques from the sample quizzes as well...DONT BUY THE BOOK.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GSB 420 is probably one of the more challenging and math oriented classes in the MBA program but Professor Selcuk makes it manageable.  Most professors at DePaul are not very good at teaching this subject but Professor Selcuk is the exception.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a smart guy, good professor over all.

Take GSB420 with him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>gsb420 is not the easiest in the mba program but this guy is one of the best at DePaul teaching it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall Prof Selcuk is a good teacher, he knows his material however this class can be queit challenging if you're not good in math.  try to do good on the homework and ask him if you have any problems</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cemil is a god guy and a good teacher. He does his best to make this class interesting but the material is boring. I got a B in the class and it was tough for me. The online only version of this class has open book tests and I would take that section had I known.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy is super nice. definitely take gsb420 from him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy professor -- if you are good at math. Professor Selcuk speaks extremely quietly, so if you don't have the mathematical aptitude to begin with then you'll find it hard to follow. While his tests are multiple choice, some of them are incomprehensible word problems from the text. Overall, this is the version of GSB 420 to take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cemil is a very nice guy. Sit to the front of the class so you can hear and see his work on the board. This is the worst class of the program overall.  Cemil is probably one of the top two at teaching it. Homework each week which takes about 2-3 hours. Test are multiple choice but difficult. I got an A-.  Cemil or Epstein are your best bets!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is alot of work (you go through alot more chapters in the book the other classes) but I would still recommend it over the other GSB 420 course b/c the exams are multiple choice so you have a better chance of getting a good grade.  You have to work hard for it but you can get an A.  Good Teacher, but alot of work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2008<br>Class Name: ECO380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material is difficult, the book is useless, can't understanding a thing.. His lectures are boring, but at least better than reading the book. On the positive side, he knows his math and explains well if you ask questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cemil is a good teacher. He explains everything quite well and if you don't understand he will explain it till you do. He made math and statistics look easy and interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor!!

Does grade on a curve, so that's nice. Times tests, beware. Tests were also open book. You could just do the homework on your own, and attend for the mid-term and final and skate through I bet.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2008<br>Class Name: ECO380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good sense of humor.

Very disorganized and difficult to understand; if you sit beyond the 4th row in class, you won't hear a thing.  oh...lowest A was set at 95%!  who does that for a graduate level course in stats&#63;&#63;&#63;  minitab software is used for homework which is useless in the real world, should teach using excel.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendence is not mandatory, all HW is online on applia, you pay $70 for applia with online book. Midterm is straight off practice tests and book. Doesn't speak english well but know's his Econ. Aplia HW + Midterm + Final + End Presentation = a preety easy A. I'd take him again.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
