			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

Very outgoing. Lectures are interesting and challenging your ideas and knowledge. I loved this class and his teaching techniques.

One of the most hilarious people I met.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2015<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The final exam was tough, but all in all I think fair.  Lectures are always interesting. I really think I learned more about religion in this quarter that I have in my whole like going to church. Be prepared to think theologically, not just spit back the same old religious fluff, as he calls it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2014<br>Class Name: CTH243REG233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is awesome. Midterm was take home, final was a bit harder than I thought. Weekly one page synthesis papers that aren't that bad. Good sense of humor. He sometimes rambles on but its always relevant. He makes religion very interesting and totally unbiased when teaching. I would recommend him over most professors!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2013<br>Class Name: CTH213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly this was my favorite class this quarter. He is so freaking funny and just an enjoyable class. He goes on tangents but you wont mind at all. The midterm and final is hard though, he does not play around with that.

He was always so fun and happy everyday in class. He got the class laughing everyday! Around all of the laughs he did teach us some extremely valuable religious insights. He was able to get the historical message of the New Testament across to everyone in the class in a really fun and thought provoking way!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty easy class and Lysik is very entertaining and never know what will happen next.

Some students found that to be threatening but I thought it was the most challenging class, getting me to think of things I never thought of before. And to have a logical, structured way of discussing things.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2013<br>Class Name: REL224<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lysik is HILARIOUS. Assignments are due every class, but they only take 20-30min to do. The material can get to be a little dull and repetitive, but he makes it worth it.
