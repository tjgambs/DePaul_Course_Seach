She also talks very loud and the lectures are long. Easy to pass with at least a B as long as you show up and turn in the final paper</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Dr. Wadie's course. She was very helpful and her lectures were very enthusiastic. Group discussion was required in this course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most interesting and eccentric professors I have ever had. Authens will open your eyes to the historical truth you've never considered. She can be very enthusiastic. Midterm, and a few quizzes here and there, no final exam but a final paper.  I learned about things I've never considered, like eugenics and the power of the World Bank</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Although quite pompous on her thoughts and teaching style, the course I took with Dr Wadie was very eye-opening. A good twist from the general history lessons. Tests are quite easy as long as you follow her lectures in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2014<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class. She claims to give pop quizzes, but in reality that only happened twice. The quizzes are on the lectures the day before, and you can pass them even if you did not read. She also says she keeps track of participation, but when you hand in your final paper she just asks you what grade you think you deserve. The final is last minute easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2014<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Oppong-wadie is a very educated woman who knows her history. She is really experienced and knowledgeable about the trial and tribulations of African people in the United States. She teaches students the other side of U.S. history that isn't put in our textbooks. I recommend this class to anyone who wants to know the truth about U.S. history</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2014<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Full of opinion. Easy to pass if you take easy notes and show up. Dont expect to get in your opinion, most of the class she will lecture and shove hers down your throat. Good ideas and theories, interesting if you agree with her and can be informational at times. Easy to pass, not much work. LOTS OF LECTURE. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2014<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a very informed teacher with a passion in the subject matter. If you go into class with an open mind and interest in the subject matter, you will gain a lot out of the class. I got an A out of the class, but mostly because i showed interest and asked many questions. Paying attention and asking for clarification will help if your confused!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
