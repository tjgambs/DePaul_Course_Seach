	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

That wouldnt be such a bad thing if she didnt act like a know-it-all & judge any less than scholarly comment. She grades hard too. She expects we all write papers exactly how she would do it yet she doesnt explain the criteria that she ends up taking the most points off for.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Professor, loved her class. Her biggest thing is that you participate and talk in class, but she understands if you're shy. Try to make thoughtful and relevant comments/questions and she'll like you. Kind of seemed to judge kids who said stupid stuff, but so did the rest of the class. I definitely would reccomend her to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: AMS276<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely the most interesting class I've ever taken. She's a somewhat hard grader and there's a lot of reading, but it's so interesting and typically not talked about that it's worth it. Changed my way of thinking. Just take the class. You won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very smart and knows a lot.  Class is very conversational, and sometimes I wish she would just give more lecture because it feels subjective. She also sometimes comes off as condescending and seems to judge students.  I learned some but it was because I read, not because of her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so open and honest.

The reading is not too long and it comes from a novel so it's easy to pay attention. She grades fairly and it helps if you participate a lot in class since it is a seminar. The material is really interesting and not just typical boring WWII info. I recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2008<br>Class Name: AMSSECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>McCracken is extremely well versed in American culture and brings a great deal of information to the table that other professors would not. She isn't easy, but she isn't terribly hard either. If you make the effort, she will see that. If you are not someone who talks in class, she lets you do extra writing to make up for it. I HIGHLY recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was excited to take her class; but then she turned out to be a horrible prof. She plays favorites, assignments are very vague & she will penalize you heavily for missing inane details, & I even went for help but it was useless.
