She'd probably give you an unfair midterm too but if she did she'd get bad evaluation so she waits until the final to screw us over. Her nice personality is a facade. She is evil incarnate.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2015<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The final was total BS. The problems were nothing like anything ever seen in class or in the homework. There was a 20 point curve. When you need a curve that big something isn't right. This is the only accounting class I got a C in so far.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2015<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>What everyone else said about her final is absolutely true. She should be hammered  in her evaluations so the school will fire her. The C- I got dropped my GPA from 3.6 to 3.55. This is the lowest grade I've gotten in any class at DePaul. Stay far far away.  Choose Wayne Jalalski or whatever his name is if you still have the chance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2015<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>Probably my least favorite accounting teacher. She is a very nice lady and there for you but the material is boring and dry. She lets you know everything on the mid-term and is open notes too but she basically put nothing that we covered in class or examples on the final. She hurts your GPA more than she helps it. I would go a different route. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2015<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst accounting prof at DePaul. Avoid if at all possible.   </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2015<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She'll tell you that the exams will be very similar to what we do in class but the actual exams are nothing like that. She's disorganized and can't explain things well. She will ruin your GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2015<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't be fooled by any of the good comments on this page. They're all written by her. The only reason more people don't fail her class is because the exams are open note and open the door to cheating. She doesn't explain things well at all. I never learned anything going to class. Nice lady but awful professor. She should be fired honestly.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2015<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Going to class is a waste of time with her. Take someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2015<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Piss poor professor. She barely teaches you anything in class and you're better off reading the textbook and doing the homework. A lot of questions are from random sentences in the text.  Speaking of homework, you'd expect the assignments to be on the syllabus but they're hidden in a D2L document.  I didn't know that until it was way too late.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Class meets usually once a week, also posts video lectures, responds to emails and is lenient on things but she does take the short paper seriously. The test is open note and making the notes is useful for studying. Do the homework problems and watch which prob. she goes over in class. Quizzes were easy points. I thought she was a good prof. do e.c</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2015<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>The basics for her class: do the homework, use only her PowerPoint notes, tests are open note.  Follow these steps, and organize your notes beforehand, you'll be fine.  Unfortunately, she and the material are very dry.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>She is definitely one of the most knowledgeable accounting professors at DePaul. At times she may stray off topic but, it's always relevant to the topic. Corporate tax is a hard class but she made it manageable with online lectures and open notes tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>I have no clue why she gets bad reviews. I took her honors section and I think every student liked her. She has awesome online lectures and the exams are essentially the homework and quiz questions rewritten. The class average was amongst the highest of any accounting class I took. If you can understand the concepts, you should pass this class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2014<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her for both ACC 380 and 383, and although she is confusing at times...I took good notes, did all the problems assigned and managed to pass with a B+. TIP: Get all 10's on the quizzes, and she curves the midterm and final by A LOT so you should be fine if you focus.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2014<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When she lectures, it's like reading a run-on sentence that extends for several pages. She also randomly decides whether she's actually going to teach you the material or go over problems. If she decides to go over problems, she can't refrain from going on a tangent. She'll never give you a direct answer. Just a myriad of words that run together.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2014<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take someone else if you can. She's a very disorganized lecturer who talks fast and rambles on about stuff that isn't relevant to what you're learning. If you want to do well, you have to rely on the textbook and homework problems to teach you the material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Careful, this is a very hard class and she doesnt teach that much. Final was extremely hard, most of the material on it we never covered in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST PROFESSOR EVER, she talks a little fast but if you just raise your hand and ask her to reexplain it she will with no problem. Exams are open note, but you still have to keep up with the class. You don't have time to look up every answer during the exam. Her online lectures are also a good help for studying! Take this professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2013<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her Exams are nothing like the problems she goes over in class and although she lets you use notes during final and midterm they are useless because she makes the midterm andfinal extremely hard!She also makes you type a useless 5 page paper on Tax ethics and has on line quizzes. Not an easy class :(</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class is hard and I do not reccommend taking her. Her tests are incredibly hard and she is not helpful at all. Honestly, if you can take another professor, I retained nothing from her class and I do not think its worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She requires a 2 page paper on ethics and gave me an 26/45 while leaving only 3 one sentence comments on what I did wrong.  She doesn't give useful information. The last class before the final she was still teaching new material and let us out 30 minutes early instead of reviewing over what will be on the final and what to study.  Avoid her.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
