A huge part of the class is lecturing but Jeremy is a great teacher and it's not boring. There were no midterms or finals in this class, just 2 (or maybe 3?) papers due through the term on material we read. Great class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very nice and down to Earth. He makes the class super easy to understand. If you don't have prior knowledge of Philosophy, I would strongly recommend his class because he does an exceptional job explaining the text and he always makes sure you understand the text. He is funny and his texts required for class are cheap as well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Bell is a very good intro teacher, in that he explains each concept very well, draws lots of diagrams, and reviews often. There are only 2 papers for the entire quarter, which can essentially be based off of notes taken in class. As long as you pay attention, the class is easy and interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Favorite teacher so far at Depaul. Very clear in class, as long as your take very detailed notes you don't have to read, BUT the reading is super easy anyway.

He is a fairly tough grader ONLY if you don't try on your two papers. He makes his expectations very clear. As far as the material goes, he knows what he's talking about. If you pay attention you'll pick up on some non-philosophy related stuff that you didn't know about. HATES plagiarism, and doesn't allow phones.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2011<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely kind, funny, and interesting man right here.

Choose 2 of 4 essay prompts and all quizzes are announced prior to taking them, some take-home. He's a  bit pretentious and rude at times, and doesn't do much to make the material interesting, just summarizes the readings. Take if you're just fulfilling a requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really cool, laid back guy. no final or midterm. all readings are posted on blackboard so you dont have to buy a book. quizzes are announced ahead. 4 paper prompts given but only you get to pick two. he explains everything pretty well. if you are only taking this class to fulfill the philosophy requirement take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just pay attention in class. He's generally pretty engaging. He basically rereads the reading assignments aloud and does a blow-by-blow interpretation. He's a very approachable guy, so asking questions isn't intimidating. He does a good job of answering questions coherently, too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2010<br>Class Name: MGT204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>had him for business ethics. besides a few quizzes and participation, your whole grade is based on a group project and group presentation. he is nice but very unclear on what he wants you to do for these too. DON'T USE YOUR CELL PHONE IN CLASS he called out people on the daily for using it. DON'T TAKE IF YOU HATE GROUP WORK</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2010<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have him for Business Ethics. He is straight, to the point, and gives you the information clearly. His quizzes are easy if you read! You do use the books, so buy them quick and used! He is an adorable dork character. You should definitely take his class! Plus, the final is a group project!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2009<br>Class Name: PHL204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he was a great teacher, he really understood the difficult material and helped me to understand it very clearly while keeping me interested. it helped me that he is adorably awkward and the subject is interesting, too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>J-Bell was the best professor I have had thus far at DePaul. He is extremely helpful. And yea he's strict but if you respect him, he respects you. I was late one day because of the Red Line and it was no big deal. Totally recommend him. If you go to his office hours he basically writes your paper for you by the way.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent instructor. He always lectures but makes philosophy extremely interesting. Don't fall asleep, miss class, or talk on the phone.

He makes everything you need to know clear. Quizes are moderately easy, and he grades fairly. Can choose which papers to write, no major tests. He is willing to answer questions when necessary but it isn't a student-involved class which makes it easy to accidently sleep...hates cell phones and calls you out</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Modest, knowledgeable.

He is so cute which helped me stay awake in the morning. Class wasn't hard as long as you gave effort and did the assigned reading and definitely took notes. He lets you know about quizzes in advance, lets you pick what papers you want to write, and makes sure you understand the material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: PHL403<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Entire class is lecture and it may seem long but he tries to incorporate humor into his teachings.  We learned about 4 philosophers and we could pick any 2 to write 4 page essays on for midterm and final throughout entire course (so we could have been done by second unit).  No tests, only 1 quiz for each unit.  I enjoyed this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2008<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's great.

He truly knows his stuff! He teaches everything crystal clear but is rather strict when it comes to writing papers. If you write what he teaches, then, you will be fine. One thing for sure, though, you will appreciate philosophy after taking his class. Many people shun philosophy, but wit him, he makes it fun/enlightening</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good guy and he has an irreverent sense of humor--which is a nice thing to have when studying Socrates. I took his focal point seminar on Plato's Republic, and found him to be helpful in deciphering the text. His class is not difficult, because he does a thorough job explaining everything from the literature to the quizzes and essays.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>o.k.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: PHL204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was really looking forward to taking this class and Jeremy ruined it completely. He is a HORRIBLE lecturer, seriously. Who can pay attention to him&#63; Maybe it was because this class was &quot;complicated subject matter&quot;, as he repeatedly said every class as well as every two minutes, but that is still no excuse. Seems like a nice guy, though. Too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class almost as much as I love Jeremy, lol.  He is very clear about deadlines, course material, and papers.  I got an A in the class easily, but if you dont take notes and participate in class, don't expect that high of a score.

He goes over EXACTLY what you need to write in your paper, so anyone who didnt get an &quot;A&quot; in the class just didnt show up.  If you show up to class and take notes, your good to go.  He is tough on plagerism and if you do it, you automatically fail.

This is a professor that you want to take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I tried in his class, went to all his classes, and did alright on his 3 papers. He still gave me a C.  Minimal chances to talk in class, but he still grades us on participation. whaaa&#63; take someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>evian man was really into his class...but the students arent. unless you are a phl major maybe take someone else (...&#63;) nietzsche was extremly confusing to read</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2004<br>Class Name: 100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very helpful in making us understand the reading, but it gets boring after a while. He repeats himself too much, but the assignments are easy if you do the readings.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes a pretty cool guy, he repeats everything at least twice.  Pretty nutty about papers though.  He sounds kinda gay, but i think he mentioned his wife once.  I like philosophy a little bit better now that I'm taking this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of a dork, but teaches a fun class.

He's only a grad student but will explain something as many times as necessary and he will always make time for out of class help.  He teaches something until we understand and isn't concered with sticking to the sylabus</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy.
