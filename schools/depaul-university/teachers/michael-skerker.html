	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

Genius! Well organized, creative, hilarious, practical, made classes both enjoyable & informative. I finished with .20% from an A (got an A-) which is always a bit frustrating, but I'd take it again even if I were guaranteed an F.

Gets the class motivated. Makes you examine situations like you hadn't thought of before. Get's the class into discussions with any opinion anyone has. Wonderful class, I would take it again.

He is amazing.  Anyone who did not do well is just lazy and not willing to do the tiniest bit of work.  Though attendance is mandatory and there are a ton of readings(ALL CAN BE SKIMMED)  He is one of the few professors who generally cares about the students.  Coming from a slacker.TAKE HIS COURSE</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2009<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would suugest do not take his class!!!!!I have read the opinions and took his class but I was very dissappinted.He is very hard grading paper too and tons of reading every week.NOT RECOMMENDED...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! Honestly if  you have the chance to take him, do it! Enthusiastic and funny. Keeps class very interesting. I never read for class and still got an A. He goes over all test material. Fair grader on papers, exam is good but you definitely need to pay attention during class. Take this class!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy.  Class was interesting even though I took it as a night class.  The papers were graded tough, yet the multiple choice exam was a breeze if you pay attention.  Attempts humor, not bad at all.  Would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2008<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class, not a blow off one at all though. He is a hard teacher esp. with papers but the multiple choice exam is pretty easy.If you want a good grade, you are going to have to work for it. Gives you 3 extra credit options and you can do them all. I would take him again but would approach the class a totally different way.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2008<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is an awesome teacher. The class was fun because it was mostly discussion and hes keeps the class interesting. Tons of reading to do but I got by through notes in class. Papers werent hard at all and the exam is multiple choice and hard if you dont study.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: MGT288<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor Ive had at DePaul! His lectures are filled with witty jokes that make u want to go to class- always entertaining. You will have to do work for the papers he assigns, they arent blow offs. The review he gives out for the test is essentially the actual test. if you study it- easy A. HIGHLY recommend! Not an easy A but you get alot out</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ironic how I got A's on both the first papers and a C on the last--he's very picky.  I had an 89%....only missed 1 class and he wouldn't round up.  You don't use the texts at all...very dry and boring.  I would not reccommend this professor if you actually want to learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Skerker is a great professor, but I don't feel like I really learned anything. You can get away with just doing the reading that homework questions are on. I didn't put much effort into my that I did hours before class and got A's on both, but he's a grammar freak! Take his class, it's not as bad as others say.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone who doesn't love this professor is a junkie. He's very witty and smart, and I would take him for every class if I could. There is a lot of reading, but it's not bad. The &quot;bone-crushingly hard test&quot; is not hard at all if you read or paid attention in class. Papers were quick and painless, and he's a fair grader too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There was a lot of reading but that is to be expected.  There are a lot of authors to keep track of but that is the hardest part. He is a fair grader on papers and the exam was really easy. His lectures are relevant and he is pretty witty. I definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is interesting, but there is a lot of reading.  He is a hard grader on papers, grammar too.  He is pretty funny and goes over anything you will need to know for the papers or test in class.  He is funny too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2008<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>REL/MGT 228 GREAT CLASS... I loved going to class, and found the way he teaches to be engaging and fun.  The papers are not as hard as everyone says they are.  I wrote both the night of (4:30am) and got A's on both.  Just get the grammar reviewed.  Print on colored paper and he gives an extra point.  Bottom line is take the class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2008<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Makes class enjoyable and material understandable. Not a walk in the park class, so if that's what you are looking for, he is not for you. He is very helpful both in and out of the classroom. Midterm is not hard but not easy. Papers have easy guidelines to meet, but talk to him if you need help. Homework is easy points. 10/10</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intelligent, funny, all around awesome professor. He makes the material relevant to modern life and makes clarifying complex concepts an art form. Wrote the clearest, funniest multiple choice exam you will ever take. The papers *are* tough.  Ask if you need help. It’s part of his job description, and he does it with as much vigor as he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2007<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard grader on papers, but lectures were enjoyable.  He has a really cute butt that makes it hard to concentrate in class sometimes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was AWESOME.  Those who don't like his class are the students who sit an do nothing.  He sparks up a lot of discussion, and really relates what we are learning to the text.  I got a lot out of his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2007<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVED HIM! Really interesting class even if your not that into business ethics. YES a lot of reading but he puts you into groups when you discuss the reading and he asks the exact same questions for the weekly hw. Only negative is the book you have to buy is really expensive and not returnable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2007<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's the best!  Yes, there's a lot of reading and questions, but it's not impossible.  His &quot;bone-crushingly&quot; hard test is not very hard at all.  He grades really fairly on papers.  If you are a decent student, willing to work a little bit, you should be fine in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2007<br>Class Name: REL201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was looking at the clock all the time. Group discussions were fun, but the class itself was quite boring. I, personally, did not like his sense of humor, but he can be funny. Takehome quizzes - every week - that did not make sense bc we had so much to read and yet all we needed is to submit the hw. Midterm kind of hard. Wouldn't take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2007<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT TEACHER! lectures are interesting and straight to the point.. he encourages class participation.. take as a night class bc he will let you out early!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2007<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! Tries to make himself the nice guy, even uses ratemyprofessor.com responses to say that this is not him at all...YEAH RIGHT! Weekly assignments impossible to complete on time!  Assigns a ridiculous amount of reading per week and wates class just reviewing homework questions Communication skills with students are horrendous!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2006<br>Class Name: REL999<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LEARN TO SPELL JERK OFF BELOW.

One of the nicest, most prepared professors I've had. Certainly be prepared for A LOT A LOT A LOT of reading.

Midterm was &quot;bone-crushingly&quot; difficult as he says. 3 page paper due in the middle of quarter is alright but 6 page paper due end of the year is insane with crazy guidelines to follow :(. I read the ratings on here at thought he would be cool but I WAS SO WRONG.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: CHRISTIANETHIC<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice professor and really knows what he's talking about.

His expectations seem high at first and he grades the papers tough, but you can still end up with an A/B+ in the class. He doesn't really check the homework, and just make sure you understand what's going on in the class and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2006<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is funny, witty, and is always well organized.

Class was always very interesting and isn't just a lecture, there is a lot of participation from the class. It was alot of fun being in the class. There was some work, we had a 6 page paper and 2 three page papers. Nothing insane. And only a final, which is very doable.
