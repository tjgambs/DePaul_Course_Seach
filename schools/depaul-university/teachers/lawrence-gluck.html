He has no lesson plan ever, he just walks in the room and starts writing on the board, and he takes 15 minutes to do a problem that should have taken 2. He relies a lot on My Math Lab, and you will basically teach yourself using that. No one should EVER take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please listen to me if you have the option do not take this class with Professor Gluck unless you are experienced with Calculus. Nothing against him as a person but he is the worst teacher I have ever had in my life. I basically taught myself calculus, please whatever you do don't take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gluck has a great mind and passion for Math.  Unfortunately, his style of teaching is horrific.  I never took a Math class where getting the right answer while using the correct methods was wrong.  You must also use his methods, which are long, tedious, and outdated.  He does not like to be asked questions. I recommend you look elsewhere.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok so basically this teacher is useless and I dont understand why he is still teaching at DePaul after having so many complaints on him!Basically the ONLY way you can or should take this class is if you havea good understanding of math and are good at it! Otherwise good luck on passing. Dr. Gluck is an intelligent person but CANT teach anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: BMS136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gluck is a brilliant man that really knows his stuff. Having said that, he has no talent for teaching and uses his knowledge of math to belittle his students. Rude, incomprehensible, and illegitimatley hard; professor gluck needs to retire before he is retired. DO NOT take his class unless you really have to atone for something horrible!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: BMS136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>each lecture for the most part consisted of going over one single problem from the homework for the first hour. with the remaining 30 minutes he would attempt to teach us the new material. his notes are scribbled all over the board, almost illegible to read or follow. office hours provided little to no help but showed that i was trying. get a tutor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2009<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!  Gluck knows his stuff and will always explain everything very clearly.  All these negative comments are heated by these students' ignorance to math, as well as their need for an exciting class in order to learn.  You might not find Gluck the most interesting teacher, but he's definitely one of the smartest people i've ever met.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm a math geek, and even I hated his class! He doesn't pay attention when he grades tests and counts correctly done problems as wrong! He should not be teaching!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2009<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the crappiest class ever! I did not learn a single thing in his class and every time I left I felt dumber. He likes to go on tangents about nothing and thinks it's funny. Stay away from this guy!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hahahahhhaha this was the worst class i have ever taken. Half the time no one showed up or left before halfway into the class. we never did anything related to the book and more than half the class dropped after the first class. If you want to have fun in a class and not learn anything this is your place. He talks and no one listens.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2009<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE! He could not teach a monkey how to peel a banana. Just took summer with him...he argued w/entire class about why it was alright for him to skip visual steps. He really does need to be fired.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2009<br>Class Name: MATH101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, the worst classroom experience I have ever had.  He is extremely confusing in class and is not helpful at all.  The majority of the class time was an arguement and he is not an eas grader. A tutor is recomended if you end up stuck in class. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Complete waste of time. Didn't really learn anything even though I did all of the hw and tried my best to pay attention during lectures. His lectures are 90% unrelated to the topic at hand. He discusses mayan temples, horse saddles, and other random interests instead of calculus Easy to get a B due to huge curve, but getting an A is hard w/o tutor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Words can't even describe...

His test grading scale is sweet!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TERRIBLE! unless you've already taken this course avoid this professor at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't know what he's talking about...takes and hour and a half for 3 problems.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>P. Gluck was useless. Midterm was 50% final was 50% of grade. I took AP Calc in high school and got 12 college credits for it- trust me this guy knows nothing.

This professor is WAY too smart for these lower level math courses. Should be teaching graduate classes. 2. If you STUDY, and work hard through the concepts, and understand them, you'll be alright. He is useless if u need help often, hes just too smart and expects u to understand things at his level. I think this feedback hes gotten is unfair.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP JUST THINKING ABOUT MY GRADE. Noone, I mean noone is a worse teacher than gluck. If his BMS 126 is the only class left sill don't take him. His jokes make no sense, and his tests might as well be in another language. I know i should have failed the class, but he failed too many students so he was forced by depaul to give C-'s</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>IF YOUR GOAL IN LIFE IS TO WASTE 2400 DOLLARS, AND BUY A BOOK YOU WILL NEVER USE THEN PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS!!!
