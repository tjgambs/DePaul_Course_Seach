Made it easier to watch everything. Definitely take the online class, it helps you have a deadline for the pop quiz of 1 week and attendance isn't mandatory then. Long papers but definitely easier than any other class for this requirement. DeWitt is an awesome and knowledgable guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: DC229<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher ever.
