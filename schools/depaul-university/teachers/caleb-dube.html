Caleb is the coolest guy in the world.  If you're an idiot and don't know how to write or talk, you will not succeed.  As long as you voice your opinion and do what little is asked of him, you will get an easy A.  Exams are easy and the papers are not difficult. I highly recommend Caleb for any class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>would not recomend him, hard grader, can be rude, not very helpful.

Doesn't know Kazakhstan is not some &quot;made up&quot; Arab country. Told students they have no right to own pets. Thinks Jimmy Hendrix was a sellout for making &quot;white music&quot;. He is dead serious about all of it, too. Not only is he an idiot, he dogmatically refuses to hear a dissenting opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perfect class to take if you want to feel guilty for being white, or get scolded for being black and having the audacity to be an individual. He said that Tiger Woods was an Uncle Tom because he dyed his hair. I guess blacks do not deserve the same freedoms as everyone else. What a ****! Not bright either - thought Kazakhstan was a fake country.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hey, I don't have any idea what these people are talking about. This man is smokin' hot and a fine dancer. Plus, his classes are incredibly informative and fact filled. He makes me want to become a social worker just to stare at his dreamy face.

His syllabi suck, but if you npay attention youll learna lot of cool things. His sense of humor takes getting used to, but once you get it he is the funniest little man ever! If you take the night section of his ISP class you don't do any volunteer work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: ISPJAZZBLUES<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>do not ever sign up for this class! if you have do anything you can to get out of this class!! he happens to be one of the worst teachers i've ever had, and he's a stupid isp teacher. you do unnecessary work ie:journals, and makes you write a rediculous paper on your volunteer work and that is usless too 15 hrs vol. work. get out of this class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2005<br>Class Name: MEDIACULTURE<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: ISP202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Caled was the nicest, coolest, most engaging professor i have had at depaul. the class gives hands on experience and shows how the real world and social constructs work.short papers due fairly often but its not too bad. he usually gives extensions if the class wants it. take him. hes great. exams are easy. dont listen to these kids.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Dube is very unclear and expects you to read his mind for papers and overall class discussion. Though he encourages classroom discussion and debate, you ultimately have to agree with everything he says or he'll make an ass of you in front of the class. We watched a lot of videos though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unclear-- Does not explain assignments well yet he expects us to read his mind and write what pleases him. Rude-- you ask him a question and he responds very abruptly to you in front of everyone. He makes you feel stupid. I will never take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst professor I've had!  He is very unclear! If you don't say exactly what he wants you to say in your reflections, you are penalized.  This class was horrible!  Too many readings and he is sometimes very rude when you ask questions! Dont take him, unless you wanna be miserable!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy needs to understand what the class he teaches is all about. He also needs to tell his students. He expects commitments that aren't identified; before, after, during, NEVER. He expects too much and grades too hard. AVOID TAKING DUBE. Dube will make you feel like your in high school again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2005<br>Class Name: SOC213<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NOT organized...NOT clear...NOT a class you should take as an elective. Dube is cool as hell, a very funny man, I will give him that. But as a teacher..HE SUCK'S!!!. HE gives loads of work, mostly reflection papers then grades you on what he thinks you should have learned instead of what was assigne</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2005<br>Class Name: JAZZBLUES<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher. He gives you ridiculous amounts of work, especially for a focal point class.  He also expects you to read his mind and is very unclear about everything. Sometimes the directions he gives in class are different from the syllibus so you are left to figure it out on your own.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: JAZZANDBLUES<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly the worst teacher to ever grace the planet.  First of all, you can't understand what he is saying, not to mention he is a very bizarre idividual.  He obviously doesn't pay close attention to detail and is very incompatable.  He doesn't care about your future and won't think twice to fail yo</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him fall Freshman year. He is so nice and funny, cool guy. It is a lot of work, and sometimes he's unclear, but if you ask he'll tell you exactly what he wants and how to get an A. He's patient and gives lots of chances if you want an A you'll get it I did. I'm taking him again in my 2nd year</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>cool guy, easy work, participate in class and u'll be fine</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2004<br>Class Name: BLUESANDJAZZ<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>oh Dube. After class all I wanted to do was roll a big fat DOOBIE!! It made the 9,000 pg. per week packets a little more interesting, but it still sucked.

The purpose of the class, in his exact words, &quot;How are you exploring Chicago through jazz and blues.&quot; Without any references we are expected to make connections on our own.

Impossible to understand.  Sometimes goes by syllabus, expects you to read his mind as to when to follow it.  Turns class from music to race- ten weeks of how blacks have been segregated against!  Inconsistent grading.  Not recomended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>can be fun, but not clear on what he wants in class.  very contradictory on what he says to what he does.  bad teacher, a lot of writing and reading homework ut he doesnt expand on it in class and goes back and forth between what he wants.  avoid taking him if possible</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good guy-but bad teacher.  too much work assigned and hard to understand.  again-good for a laugh, but not for a grade</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a very well organized course, but Dube is an intelligent, nice, funny teacher.
