If you take her Capstone class, you will have to read 8 books from cover-to-cover. You will not pass the class if you do not partake in the discussion. The class runs like a book club. No tests; no quizzes, just 2 book reviews, a curriculum assessment (which is fun), and a final paper</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2014<br>Class Name: PSC282<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really kind and sweet. Surprisingly not much reading in this class, but 25 service hours at an organization are required. No midterm, final is a take-home. One short research paper, and a longer reflective essay.

The majority of her lectures cover interesting material while engaging with the students. Her classes are, without a doubt, very helpful to someone wanting to understand the political world. She is fair and wants her students to learn. One of the best professors at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2014<br>Class Name: PSC213<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Andolina is pretty stiff. Not enthusiastic. Course is draining from the amount of reading. You really have to work for that A, but it is achievable. Topics are really interesting, and you do learn quite a bit on political socialization. There are quizzes, one 12 page paper, and a take home final consisting of several essays.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2014<br>Class Name: PSC213<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Andolina is very respected in the field and you can tell she is passionate about what she teaches. The readings were at times extremely long which made it difficult to do well on the pop quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: PSC213<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not strongly recommend Andolina because of the pop quizzes, ten page paper, and final exam. The class is full of readings, and I mean online articles that students will be quizzed on. Lectures are good, but the assurance of a good grade is questionable even if you read.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2014<br>Class Name: PSC213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Andolina is great. Her lectures and readings are interesting and engaging, pop quizzes are really easy if you do your reading, and she is fair and knowledgeable! Great class, definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: PSC213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite classes I've taken.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: PSC213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a wonderful teacher!

She is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subjects covered in class. She does a great job keeping the class interested and engaged. Assigns a decent amount of reading with pop quizzes (open note) and several writing responses to the readings but she is not a tough grader. Would definitely recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2013<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome prof. Really makes lectures interesting. Learned a whole lot about politics.

However, while she provides wonderful specifics for paper writing (grading rubrics, etc.), she gives NO specifics as to what is on the midterm or final. Be prepared to do a lot of reading on your own; she doesn't cover it all in class. The papers saved me in regards to my grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, makes class very interesting even when I was tired in the morning. She never pushes her views on you and she literally cares about what her class has to say on different subjects. Just participate and read the textbook and you should be good to go. She can be a tough grader on papers, so just watch out.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Andolina is a wonderful teacher. There is a lot of reading and unfortunately since I work, I was not able to keep up with the reading. She does not give you the answer and makes you work for it. One downside is there is no study guide for midterm or final and she expects students to review all readings prior to the test approx. (300 pgs)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher. Her passion for politics shows through her teaching but she doesn't force her views on you. There's a lot of reading, if she sense that you aren't reading she will give pop quizes. She's a fair grader and very understanding.I would take her agian. Going I thought the class was boring, but it turned out to be fun!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2009<br>Class Name: PSC213<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She assigns a lot of reading, but you really need it for the quizzes which are a piece of cake if you do the reading. She doesn't impart her political views onto the class at all, which is a plus. Responds to emails quickly, I really enjoyed her and the class. If you are a poli sci major or just like political science, take a class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>prof. andolina is just amazing. though it is a politics class she usually plays the devils advocate rather than pushing her own political views. if you have the time i greatly recommend this class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: LSP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a lot of reading and writing with Prof. Andolina.

Great professor if it is your first political science class.  Asks for a lot in the midterm and final but just write down opinions on homework and you are golden.  She also has a sense of humor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice eye candy. But more importantly, she's a nice, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic prof. She was even cool with me walking in late every class cause of my work schedule last Spring (I've had profs complain before). As far as bias, well, I'm conservative to a T, and I got an A, easily. Would definitely love to take 1 more class with Prof. A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2008<br>Class Name: PSC390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Andolina is fair, caring, and will make you consider all the view points. You CAN get an A out of her class and be a conservative. There was a lot of reading, but she is engaging and will make you think about the critical issues. She's pretty much awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I heard she is a great Political Science professor but I took her for the ISP 120 math requirement.  It was awful! Although she was very fair and understanding, she cannot explain Math well. Don't take her for a QR requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Andolina! I took her for ISP 102 Generational Politics. She really knows what she is talking about and you can tell she really loves what she does. She is very helpfull and very nice if you show her respect. Reading is important but if you like the material then the class is easy. She is a great prof and I will definitely take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2008<br>Class Name: PSC390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't understand why students are saying she is biased. I had her for my capstone, and I LOVED her. I wish I had taken her previously, but unfortunately, I didn't. She's intriguing, BALANCED, and thought-provoking. She has a casual attitude that I appreciated especially this close to the &quot;finish line&quot;, and has a genuine interest in her students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2008<br>Class Name: PSC390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Adolina is a great teacher.  She is helpful and willing to provide feedback on her grades.  She is not at all biased!  She respects others opinions even if they are not similar to hers!  She is a pretty hard grader but she is an excellent teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2007<br>Class Name: PSC213<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXTREMELY biased. Disliked me STRONGLY due to my political views (they are polar opposites). I read ALL the readings AND participated, but she would literally say my opinions were wrong. I am an A-average student, but I managed a B- in her class. Very unclear in guidelines and snooty. Likes to talk about herself a LOT. Annoying. Will NOT recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really like Prof. Andolina. She is really willing to help you during her office hours. Study from her power points, read for class and ask about anything your unclear about because all of it will be either on your midterm or final. Get on her good side & she'll write you awesome recommendations!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2006<br>Class Name: PSC200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely fantastic professor - she's kind of a strict grader on papers, but she provides fantastic feedback and is always willing to help.

She had the kids do most of the &quot;teaching,&quot; which means getting to hear a bunch of suburban white kids complain about stuff (I am white, too). But she was nice and an easy grader.
