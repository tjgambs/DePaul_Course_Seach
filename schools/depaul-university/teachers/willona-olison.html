Pros: Tons of information, great content, and interesting.  Cons: Failed to respond to emails, midterm features sections not covered, and reading responses ask for answers in unassigned chapters. She takes advantage of online course, being absent professor. Couldn't be bothered to get textbooks at store.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC356<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nonie is great! Organizational Consulting was such a wonderful class- it gave me tons of "real" experience in regards to consulting in the real world. She brought tons of helpful personal stories and advice. I really loved and enjoyed this class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendance is mandatory but it's interesting and goes by quickly. Go over readings and find a couple interesting points to bring up in class, or just discuss your opinion. She's young so she knows how to relate to us, plus she's hilarious. Workload is pretty easy: a couple reading probes, short presentation, group project, and final paper. Easy A!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS251<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nonie is awesome. Hilarious but no nonsense, so don't try to BS her. Highly recommended. Exams are easy if u read.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2011<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes cool but class was sooo boring it was hard to pay attention. Papers were fairly easy.  Test was based on lectures. Easy but very boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2010<br>Class Name: SS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Dr. Nonie for a sophomore seminar in multiculturalism. She was great. Discussions in class were interesting and the assignments weren't too bad. Participation is mandatory. Show up and talk if you want an A. Dr. Nonie is extremely available and very helpful. I would take her again in a second.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very pleasant and approachable women.  I agree with some of the others about the fact that there's no basis (i.e powerpoints) for the notes and that makes it hard to determine what's going to be on the final.  Otherwise, highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2010<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Olison is a great professor. I adore her. The one thing i found frustrating about the class was she didn't use powerpoints and everything was pure lecture with an outline guideline...It was sort of confusing to keep up at times but her final was strictly objective and simple. If you show up to class and listen you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Olison is a great professor.  She presents the material in a way that is easy to understand AND easy to study.  The final was straight out of the notes she gave us in class and the paper was a case study that you had to relate to her notes.  Super easy, really nice, funny too!  She always made comments about kids being **** and high in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very intelligent and knowledgeable.  The final was a bit harder than I expected, but overall I learned a lot.  She is really funny as well; I enjoyed going to class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes interesting and knows what shes talking about.  I only wish is should have gotten some idea of what my grade was going to be because I got not grades back till the end of the term.  I don't understand my grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dont take her she seems nice at first but is too hard of a grader, only is nice and helpful to her favorite brown nosers in class and is unfair ..avoid her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: CMN100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes class interesting and enjoyable.

Attendance is not required and puts outlines of notes on BB. Class lectures get boring at times, but she tries. BUT, she says that you don't need to know terms and def. for tests, but you DO. 1 paper(easy) 2 tests, and final grp. paper. Great prof. and highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2007<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You would be crazy NOT to take this professor.  She is amazing.  Interesting, spirited, funny, respectful, understanding, these are just a few words that describe her as a professor.
