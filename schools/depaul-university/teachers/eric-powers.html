Once he never came to class & never told anybody. He doesn't prepare you for deadlines (doesnt explain whats due). Never responded to emails sent early in quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2012<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a good professor and a good guy overall. His lectures get a little dry, but he has alot of good information/experience to learn from. Personally, i would like to learn more useful things such as powerpoint and access. Spent very little time on programs like that. But overall he was a soild teacher. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Generally easy going, but won't make any effort to answer any form of communication outside of class. Literally never answered a single email. I ended up having to call him at his work office number I found through yelp.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2010<br>Class Name: IS455<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor seems knowledgeable about the subject, but he has no business whatsoever teaching! He is unavailable outside of class, does not provide contact info & does not return assignments in a timely manner. He does not answer emails at all...what e-biz prof. can't answer emails&#63; I hope that Depaul re-evaluates letting him teach in the future!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2010<br>Class Name: MIS680<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please save yourself from taking this class if Eric Power's is teaching. He is not a teacher and does not deserve to teach. He may have knowledge about e-business, but is horrible when it comes to teaching. He is very slow in responding and grading materials. DO NOT Take This Class with Eric Powers!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Save yourself the trouble and pain!!! DO NOT TKE THIS CLASS!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is way harder than it should be. He is a hard and unfair grader. I got a B after studying for hours and hours! Just take another professor, this class should be fun not tortured. I graded him the same way he grades his students!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Eric is very smart and made the class very interesting. The project at the end of the quarter was a little difficult, but he helped a lot and was available. If you keep up with the class you will do well. He also gives out the iPods for those who score a 100 on the quizzes. Had fun in class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2009<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Eric is smart and knowledgeable.  He always has ideas for creating new businesses.  Quizzes can be difficult, but he provides study guides online.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2008<br>Class Name: MIS1227<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ERIC always tries to show himself off.It takes him forever to grade assignments. Hard grader.Uses the longest, hardest and unusual English words just to show how highly educational he is, that it would take you an hour to understand what he is talking about. He seems very nice and gentle at the beginning and then you will be shocked with grades!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2008<br>Class Name: MIS680<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I completely agree with the last comment. Eric is a great guy however, he is EXTREMELY slow in grading assignment and returning them to you. He is a hard grader with the assignments. For your quizzes the questions are totally ambiguous. I would have seconds doubts of taking this professor for another course.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2008<br>Class Name: MIS680<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was pretty engaging and Eric did a good job of auding variety to the daily syllabus.  However, he is not responsive outside of class if you need assistance, and it takes him at least a month to return grades from HW assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2008<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Eric was extremely helpful. He brought in real life experience from his job, and he also brought in speakers from his work as well. He was there to help us on our DBase project on a Saturday! He tries his best to motivate students and he'll do as much as he can to help you get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2007<br>Class Name: MIS366<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredible professor, cares about the students, their grades and is full of energy (not to mention easy on the eyes).  I RECOMMEND this professor for as many classes as you can take with him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2007<br>Class Name: MIS680<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Professort.  Cares about the students and has a passion about the topic.  Real business experience and teaches based on his experience and not theory.  No Midterm/Final.  Not a particularly difficult grader.  Classes are interesting and interactive.  Lots of discussion vs. lecture.  Great Prof...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2006<br>Class Name: MIS680<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you consider taking MIS 680 - Electronic Business course, you should take it with Prof.Eric. He was an e-business entrepreneur of himself. Still working full-time job. His teaching style will encourage you to  look and think business in different perspective. His classes were very interactive, informative and educational. one among the best I ha</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2006<br>Class Name: MIS680<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Powers is a really creative teacher.
