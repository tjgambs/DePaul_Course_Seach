			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

Lots of energy, not a difficult class with this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2015<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Jin Choi doesn't have the skills necessary to be an effective teacher.  While he is knowledgeable about Statistics, that knowledge is not easily transferred.  He will overexplain fairly straightforward topics, but flies through actual problems with little explanation.  Also, his book is a required text (conflict?) and is written like he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Choi is awesome! His lectures were clear & he tries to keep it fun. Attendance counts as extra credit toward your exam grades. The weekly quizzes were pretty easy to get 100s on when you study your notes & the outlines he has online. He also posts practice questions for each chapter that help with studying for the tests & quizzes. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Choi is there for his students. Go to class, pay attention, study a bit on the side and you will do fine. He genuinely wants to prepare his students for the business world. He forces you to stay on top of the material by giving you ten question quizzes every week. Doing well on the quizzes will allow you to do well on the three tests. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Choi is a really good professor.

I'd take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2015<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Choi is THE BEST professor I have ever taken. He is very clear and makes the class easy to follow. Takes his time to go through each chapter making sure that the class understands the material. There is alot of extra credit on for every quiz, midterm and final. He even gives extra credit for attendance! Very smart with great credentials!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2014<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Moves very quickly through things.

This course requires a lot of work and dedication, but if you work hard an A is very attainable.  A lot of effort will be required if you do not have a strong background in calculus, statistics and high level math skills. All in all a tough, but fair class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intense course that you will have to work hard to do well in.  Listen to his advice on how to do well: 1. Read the book & do the examples.  2. Listen to the lecture and solve the examples presented in it.  3. Do the homework. He cares and wants you to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material itself isn't easy, but he does a great job preparing you for his exams and lets you know when you expect a quiz. He provides an outline of what he'll cover in class and does a great job in explaining tough topics. Attendance is mandatory. I went to all classes, studied for the 3 exams, and reviewed notes before quizzes and got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is definitely the weed-out for the MBA program. Horror stories abound. Take Choi's online class and join a study group. You'll actually understand the concepts and be able to use them. This isn'y an easy course by any stretch, but he's the best professor to take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wouldn't recommend, tough grader and he moves through material so ridiculously fast. Tough quizzes without notice and the class average was a 72%. I would take someone else for, what should be, an easy business core class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2013<br>Class Name: GSB400<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought Professor Choi was extremely reasonable and helpful for the numerous topics we covered in the class. It's a class for students who aren't familiar with basic calculus and statistics and while we moved at a very fast pace, we covered a lot of material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not an easy class, but the prof is very helpful and explains the material well.  I read some of the comments and wanted to add that there is nothing wrong with his English - I understood everything just fine.  He tries to help students as much as he can and jokes a lot to lighten up the mood.  I would take a class with him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Choi is one of the best teachers I've had at DePaul. He is very clear when he explains things, and he lets you know what will be on the exams. The questioning on the exam can make you second-guess yourself, but if you study, you'll do well. He ties what he teaches into everyday life, and the class was extremely helpful. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly Recommend! I am in the online section which consists of weekly online homework from his book (30%), Midterm (35%), and Final (35%). Both exams are take-home and you have three days to complete them. He has videos to explain each chapter on D2L. He is really helpful if you have any questions, give you everything you need to succeed in class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The textbook and the professor's words are very inconsistant (and he wrote the textbook).
