			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Buy Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />

Her expectations are a bit ridiculous and the writing style which she espouses is ugly and plain.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2013<br>Class Name: HAA280<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She "helps you" by reviewing your papers via email, then tells you to change all of it. Wants you to write like a robot with no variation in words. She focuses on how you write the paper rather than the content. She grades so hard it's ridiculous. Exams are unbearably hard. This class ruined my 4.0 gpa if that tells you anything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2013<br>Class Name: HAA280<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't bother. Seriously. It doesn't matter what you do or how you do it, she'll grade you in a really rough way that doesn't fit the class [it's a 200 level survey after all]. She pretends to help & then smacks you down with totally unfair grades. I'm not meaning to whine, but I'm a very good student & worked very hard to be treated very poorly.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2013<br>Class Name: HAA280<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid at all costs. Nice lady and wants to help, but her grading is ridiculous and harsh. She grades in a manner that is degrading to a student and demoralizing. Her expectations exceed her peers' and she is caught up in herself. She is a great teacher in the classroom, but she's highly inappropriate in her grading. I'm no idiot and I received a B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2011<br>Class Name: HAA377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She definitely knows her stuff!

As for the mid-term/final you must memorize about 12 pieces from art history which can be daunting task for some.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: ART666<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talks too much. To the point where you try to write down something important she is saying, but then she talks way to fast to follow. Have fun working your tail off for a mediocre grade.

It's difficult, but she's awesome. You have to memorize a lot, but it's definitely manageable if you study & she tells you exactly what you need to know for the test. She's very picky about the paper, but she's so helpful & will edit your drafts. She's strict, but funny & knows everything about art history</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm in her class right now (this quarter) and I have really enjoyed it. I think she is a wonderful teacher and a credit to the university. She's intelligent and she really cares. She always offering her office hours and she gladly meets with anyone to help them. Great, great, great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this woman; everything about her. She's clear, concise,& she knows what she's talking about. Is she tough&#63; Uhm, yeah&#63; But this is DePaul, not some 2nd rate public university & therefore she should rightfully expect the best from us. I got an A because I studied, worked hard, & I'm more than capable of writing clearly & effectively.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have no idea what the people are complaining about! This woman is passionate, intelligent, & she KNOWS HER STUFF! Art History is NOT a required course @ DePaul & if you're not a major in the discipline, DON'T TAKE THE CLASS! Dr. Anderson is wonderful, insightful, direct, and clear as a bell. If you actually WANT to learn, PLEASE take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2011<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most arrogant teacher I've ever experienced.  Her lectures are full of dull and useless information that is frequently irrelevant to art history.  You're expected to memorize dates and styles, while completely ignoring political or social interactions of the era.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2010<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have a feeling some of the people rating her are just a wee bit bitter. She's a really nice person and she's ridiculously clear about what she expects. Her lectures are thorough and interesting and she literally tells you everything you need to know. Tough class though. I worked very hard and got a B+.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2010<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is horrible. do not take this teacher for a level 100 course. it was the worst class i have ever taken. if you like your g.p.a do not take this course with this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2010<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow this teacher was horrible. She failed me. She teaches the class like it's a graduate class. I think I missed one day and I even went to see her for extra help on several occastion.  Horrible grader! DO NOT TAKE HER unless your major has something to do with art history.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2010<br>Class Name: HAA102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>to add to the comment below (which is mine) the only reason there is a happy face is because the class and the material is actually easy and straightforward. She is also really helpful. She's just a very harsh grader</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2010<br>Class Name: HAA102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Anderson has a very skewed idea on how writing papers should be. If you write beautifully, with lots of language and detail, don't bother taking her class. She wants you to write like you are writing a machine manual. I thought it was an Art History class and not a Graduate level writing class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2010<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extreamly picky grader but she is willing to spend 2hrs helping you so not unreasonable. Learned A LOT & got more out of her class then any other. I respect her a lot and she pretty much tells you what she expects. You need to study very hard but if you can't pull a B in her class then you don't belong in college anyway.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2010<br>Class Name: HAA300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TERRIBLE! I attended all the classes participated every day and still got a D! If you are a free thinking, more artsey and less history DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS, I could not fit into her little box she wanted all of her students to be in! everything she wanted was ridiculous!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a total nazi.

She practically outlines your comparison paper with such detail that you only have to add some words. This said this is where she gets merit for being picky; she goes out of her way to tell you what she wants.Hard but definitely worth taking just take notes (tells you what to write/not)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2010<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE, WORST EVER, MUST BE MASTER WRITER READY TO PRESENT YOUR RESEARCH OR YOU GET AN F</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2010<br>Class Name: HAA100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Anderson is a great teacher and is ready and willing to help her students with any problem.

One factual error on a paper and you get a C. Also, there are only three grades so if you do poorly on the midterm and her idiotic paper you probably WON'T pass the class. For a 100 level class she grades like it's grad work. Not worth it. Horrible curriculum.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: AAH103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ocd about gading. ridiculous rules...once sent me an email saying i went to the bathroom too often. however shs a good teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2009<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Your work must be a masterpiece ready to be published in an art history journal otherwise you get an F. cold no emotion, speaks very fast, you have to be absolutely perfect like her otherwise you fail and she will tell you to drop the class because your not good enough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the worst EVER. I am assuming that those who gave her positive reviews major in fields closely related to this class. This is supposed to be an elective class. Three grades for 10 weeks is a joke.

She spelled out EVERYTHING that she wanted on the tests and paper, and I didn't have to do any work at all.  Barely studied, did the paper the night before it was due - and still got an easy A.  Not really what I want when I'm paying this much to go to school and learn.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2008<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>unless your an art major and you absolutely looove art,don't take this class.The class is very boring and if you fall asleep,she will kick you out. she is very meticulous and a harsh grader.

I thought the lectures would get boring, but they never did! She is so clear on her expectations that it is nearly impossible to fail anything in this class. Also very helpful and excited to teach and excited for her students to learn and be engaged in the subject.

She really knows her art history and is very nice. She is eager to help with anything. She is so specific when writing her papers that they're fairly easy to write and her grading isn't too hard. She is a great teacher and I would take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are interested in art history, and do not mind doing a large amount of studying, take this class. If you are only taking this class to fill a requirement, find a new art class. This class was extremely hard and demanding. The are only 4 grades.

She truly wants the student to gain an understanding and knowledge about art history.  For Pre Modern Architecture she supplied handouts with vocabulary, images, names, dates, etc.  Her expectations are high, but she wants you to learn and succeed.  Feedback on exams/papers are in-depth and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2008<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly intelligent and well spoken professor! Take this class if you truly enjoy learning. She expects a lot from her students, but is very clear about assignments/exams. She is extremely helpful and organized. This class takes effort and commitment to the subject, but is well worth all of the hard work!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear about what you need to know for the midterm/final.

Sticks to attendance policy, willing to help her students.  tells you at the first class what she expects and why not to take the class. only four grades (midterm, final and two papers)  Grades the papers pretty hard, I was four lines short of three pages and she dropped my grade down</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/17/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cold.  Very cold.  She knows what shes talking about but I don't think I ever saw her smile.  Everything is very organized and all of the information is presented very clearly, but I think she lost her soul many years ago.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved her and her class. On the first day she gives her students every reason why not to take her class, but it is worth it to stick with her if you have any interest at all in art history. She's reliable and clear about what she expects from her students, and that may be too much for some people. There are 2 3-page essays and two big tests-not bad</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a great teacher and really knows her stuff, you will get a lot out of her class even if you dont like art. She tells you EXACTLY what she expects on everything so take really good notes.

While the class is very interesting and I thought she did a good job of teaching, I very much dislike her stlye of grading, and exams. I like challenging classes, but this class is not challenging, it is just hard and I feel there are many things that are uneccessary. Portions of the exam (like the readings) we never go over.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2007<br>Class Name: ART371<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Firstly, just because someone is young, it does not mean they are hot... Secondly, Tamsen does NOT know her stuff... We constantly corrected her and she only acknowledged about half of her mistakes...  Thirdly, she needs to realize that people don't read art history books.  It's her job to teach us the important stuff, which she didn't do at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: HST371<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not sure teacher knows what she's talking about. 1 paper on Chicago's Expo, but has visited site once.

She lectures on A LOT of material but her examines only cover about 10% of all the****ty material you are forced to learn. She is an extremely hard grader. NEVER TAKE HER. Oh yes, and this is coming from a student who got an A in her class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I Love her!! She is the best professor in Depaul and if I could take her in ever quarter I would. Sorry to those that don't like going to class but if you go to class and take notes you'll get a really good grade. She clearly loves what she does and really cares about her students. If you talk to her about your problems with class she'll help you!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class has a lot of info..but she is very helpful</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She grades very harshly on papers.
