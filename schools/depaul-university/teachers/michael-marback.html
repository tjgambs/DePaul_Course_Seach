			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

Do not buy textbook and cengage if you wanna save a lot of money</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great friendly and helpful professor. He gives practice midterms and finals which are almost identical to the actual ones he gives. He is always there to give advice about class or real life. Extremely approachable, and knows the material well. I defiantly recommend him. Class is more about definitions then accounting also if that helps.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He uploads practice quizzes for every chapter on D2L, and gives detailed solution manuals for all of them. Practice midterm and final as well. He is extremely clear, a little goofy which makes the lectures all the more bearable, and is always eager to help struggling students. His class was crucial in my decision to become an accounting major.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Marback made ACC102 so easy. I have heard horror stories of this course, and I actually really liked it. He gives practice midterms and finals which really help in studying for the exam! Also, his use of acronyms really makes the material easy to learn. If I had to take another course in ACC, I would definitely take it with him! EASY!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2012<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Even when I'm out of his class, he still helps me when I have questions about accounting and finance. Accounting got less complicated with him as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marback is a great professor, I wasn't sure about taking his class because of the comments here but I have to say I'm glad I did. He explains the material well, hands out his own summaries on each chapter (I didn't even read the book), quiz every week, midterm & final. Very easy to understand I didn't even need the book and got an &quot;A+&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy has taught partners of the top four accounting firms. He has credentials and is extremely intelligent. He dumbs down the material for US! For our benefit!! I think he makes this difficult class, squeezed into a short quarter system, much more manageable!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No other Accounting Professor is so involved in his class. It actually disgusts me to read the negative comments, knowing how much Marback cares for his students. Through use of acronyms and real life examples, Marback decodes the complicated language of accounting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is no other Accounting Professor at DePaul that is so involved with his students. Marback tries to decode the difficult language of Accounting (especially as an intro class) through various acronyms/examples. I bet the negative commenters on this page just got a bad grade and can't take the blame themselves. He is a great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Clearest Professor Ive had at Depaul in what was required for the course. ACC102 is one of the more involved courses but his willingness to help when needed makes me wonder how anyone could get less than a B if theyre not aiming for academic probation. Tells exactly what you need for qzs/exms. A+ as Professor, but dont underestimate subject matter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Professor, tells you exactly what to study. If you pay attention during class it is very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>terrible</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not trust the good comments. It is obviously the same person (maybe him) trying to make himself look better. Trust me, he is the worst professor ever and is frankly not knowledgeable at all. Final is impossible. Take someone else. Also avoid Cohen when you get to 305. He's even worse.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't believe people are unhappy with him.  I always know exactly what he's talking about and what he wants from us.  He gives us multiple chances to succeed if we have trouble, but he still makes us know the material.  He makes it easy to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>of course accounting is hard and some people might have been confused by his teaching style but overall good professor. He really wants you to succeed, he just needs to be more clear in how he teaches. He does give you a lot notes , so really study them and you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so involved with the class by always sending handouts, studyguides, emails, etc. because he really wants you to learn. Great professor.  Accouting is not easy but he does what he can to help you succeed. you have to study though, obviously.  Really nice guy and lets you retake quizzes to do better.  Takes feedback seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accounting isn't an easy class, but Marback sure tries to make it easy for his student.  Marback gives about 5 quizzes during the semester and he always passes out a study guide for the quizzes (which are word for word questions that are on the quiz).  I will admit he is all over the place when covering the material but at the end of the day he tie</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher! do not take him. his quizzes are easy but his midterm and final are horrible. do not take him. he is soooo confusing</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him if you want to fail. Take him if u want to laugh at his stupidity. Take him if you don't want to learn anything. Take him if u want to memorize everything and teach yourself rather than learn something. If you take him....good luck....you will need it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>how is this man still teaching at DePaul&#63; he could not teach if his life depended on it. fire him DePaul!!!! he's ruining Accounting students' careers. The man is a joke!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is by far the WORST proffessor at DePaul. He has no idea on how to teach or what he has talking about. It seems hard to believe that this man has a college degree. All he talks about is Warren Buffet. He almost ruined my Accounting career becasue I had to go to Acc 303 and 304 unprepared since i didn't learn a single thing in his class at all!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst accounting teacher out there. Do not take him. He says the class is &quot;easy&quot; but his midterm and final are impossible. He also says the quizzes and homework do not effect your grade, and they do get counted into your grade. Stay away!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
