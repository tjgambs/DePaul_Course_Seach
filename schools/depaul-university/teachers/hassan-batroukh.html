I don't know why people are saying he's old-fashioned (whatever that means); he's rather open-minded.  Sometimes it's hard to understand his point, but if you ask, he'll explain.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2005<br>Class Name: ARB<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You wont learn arabic, you will get an A, but you wont learn arabic. There is no syllibus, agenda or goals. Its a boring class, waste of money and time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2005<br>Class Name: ARB101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grear professor, nice man too. don't listen to anything else anyone tells you.

He was unconventional but in a good way. His only goal was for us to learn and I think he accomplished this. Take the class.
