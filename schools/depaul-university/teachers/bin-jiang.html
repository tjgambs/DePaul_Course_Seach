	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Buy Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />

If you study the power points you will do well on the midterm and final. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2015<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the best.

Although the class is difficult, he explains the material very clearly and is more than willing to help students. However, it is important to pay attention in class and take good notes. Otherwise, the homework assignments will be almost impossible to complete correctly. Overall I recommend him forr managerial statistics.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2014<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is the easiest I have ever taken. However, I didn't learn a thing in the class. His English is pretty bad, and he cracks jokes all through class to pass the time. Would not recommend if you want to learn anything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2013<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What I like about his class is that he prepares slides that are very clear and he explains them very well and gives examples to help you understand. He's also very funny. He doesn't give homework, but you have 2 group presentations, 2 papers, midterm, and final. I would definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2013<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher with clear expectations. His accent does make him a little hard to understand but overall what he is conveying is very clear. Very little work outside class except to review for midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2012<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>excellent teacher, very smart and wise, he will teach you very interesting material</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Among the best professors. He is nice and funny. The class is very organized with power points slides that I recommend you print. He makes the class interesting and gives excellent examples. The best part is that he practically tells you what is on the midterm&final, its your fault if you do poorly.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2011<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Jiang is awesome. He makes this class interesting by using very unique examples and real life examples. He is also very funny!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2011<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is incredibly easy. Anybody who says it is hard is simply a moron. He tells you EXACTLY what to know for his midterm/final. It's basically your A to lose. He is difficult to understand but after the first class there really is no issue. Most of the course material is common sense anyways. If you don't understand something, simply ask him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2011<br>Class Name: MGT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly he was just very difficult to comprehend. Often times it would be a struggle for you to understand what he was saying. His power points lacked significant clarity. Your grade can end up being reflected worse than you would like simply because nothing is clear.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Jiang is a nice guy, and funny.Took his Midterm recently, and wow I was definitely in for a treat. A lot harder then I had expected, and contained alot of material which wasn't covered in class. Unfair if you ask me, but I had prior knowledge of the subject before taking the class so it wasn't bad for me. But other students weren't happy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expect the worst.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decided to take his class after reading reviews, but unlucky for me he switched his curriculum this quarter. A lot of work involved, more work that I had anticipated from a MGT class. Taking 2 accounting classes and this class has been hell for me this quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2010<br>Class Name: MGMT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher! Wants everyone to do well in the class. Will always make himself available to you if you are struggling in any way. He always answered my emails within minutes. I honestly have nothing bad at all to say about him. If you get anything lower than B it has to be because of some sort of life, work, or family crisis!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2010<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the better professors.  You can find an easier operations mgt professor, but doubt you will learn as much as you would in his class.  Midterm was difficult for me, but final, paper and presentation were easy.  You'll learn a lot in this class and as boring as a subjest as it is, Jiang makes it tolerable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Heavy &quot;Texas&quot; accent as he likes to joke. Great teacher, no textbook- it is all on PP that he has put together. Tough grader but you learn a lot and its all relevant to real world. Enjoyed his class a lot. Midterm- 35%, Final-35%, case study-20%, team presentation- 10%. Great midterm and final reviews and if you study those you are going to Ace it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2009<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher for what I expected to be an awful and boring class.  He made it remarkably interesting and relevant.  Take this professor for an easy grade and an interesting class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: MGT202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is good at teaching, no doubt! Though his easy quizes are totally irrelevant when it comes to checking you knowledge. The final exam, on the other hand, is quite difficult due to the complexity and ambiguitiy of the question he asks on it. Can't complain about him, though can't say that I would take him again...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher and this was honestly a class I looked forward to each day.  He is so funny and so incredibly intelligent.  You will learn a ton and he makes everything relevant, something most DePaul teachers suck at.  He told us what would be on the exams and he was spot-on.  Claimed he had offers from other schools so he might be gone. Top 5 pro</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: MGT202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher makes class fun and easy.  All he asks from his students is to come to class.  He cracks jokes through out the whole class period.  He has a quiz and homework due every week that is easy if you come to every class.  His final is the best because he gives you a take home final to do with your group.  Just make sure you have smart people</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely knowledgeable, witty,  interesting to listen to. Relates to outside a lot and has so much interest in teaching and that makes you interested in learning. Exams are not that hard if you are prepared.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good instructor and a good guy.

I would consider him as top five  during my learning career. Sometimes its hard to understand him but he is very knowledgeable, motivate you, and  brings a lot of humor to the class. Tests are straightforward and easy as long you study hard and follow his lead. No book required.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2008<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bin Jiang is a really funny guy.  The best part is, his stories have relevence to the material.  Two presentations required, but he doesn't take them very seriously.  Case study also required, he's an easy grader.  Midterm and final were short and sweet.  Got an A with minimal effort, and still learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an awesome teacher. He only uses power point so you have to go to class. There is no book. Very simple: midterm, final, 2 big group presentations, and a case study. Always take advantage of extra credit that's what got me my A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exceptional instructor, makes the course as easy as possible.

Stats is a very hard topic and he did well to cover the material. Must arrive on time. Group homework/final, so choose your team wisely. No txt book needed.

This class is all statistics but he is very good at explaining the material. Pay attention and take good notes and you will definitely pass the class. All homework is group work. You have to be on time to class but since it is a two credit hour class you are only hurting your grade when you miss.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class can get boring.  He is funny but the topic is pretty dull.  His real world examples really help with the comprehension of the material.  You must go to class to get the notes (oh no textbook for this class).

I ever met....Mgt. classes are essential in commerce and he makes sure he drives home the point.  His explanations are clear and straight forward. No surprises other than jokes, one after another! You woudlnt want to sleep in his class.  He does DEMAND respect of his time and your effort.  BE on time!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most enjoyable classes I have taken in my MBA. Jiang is a fantastic professor and he makes a boring subject interesting. Made himself available during office hours and was very helpful.  The guy is hilarious as well..always had the class laughing.  Text book is not needed so save the $$.  Definitely take his class if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No textbook necessary.  Group homework AND final.  Teaches the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of stats without going into mundane details and intricate formulas.  He's pretty damn funny too.  Highly recommended for GSB 420.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Prof! He teaches high level and he's very helpful. He tells funny stories which makes class FLY! Attendance is a must, but he lets you out early. Homework and quizzes pretty easy.

The class is worth it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2007<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't let him intimidate you at first, he is actually a funny & nice guy.

He goes above and beyond to explain things, jokes a lot and makes things easy to remember. He makes sure that everyone understands the material. Do not buy the testbook, he gives handouts each class that are very helpful. Take home final, group work. I would highly recommend this professor!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is OK, not that interesting. He will give opportunities for extra credit. Easy to get an 'A', not that hard to get a 'B', if you get anything lower than a 'C' you are just retarded. Miss more than 2 classes and you will automatically FAIL! That is what sucks, attendance is strict, for a class that you could teach yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2007<br>Class Name: MGT202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an ok teacher, class was boring but you can manage.

Eventhough he seems easy but don't be fooled by that. You'll think that you're doing great until the end and your grades would say something else.

His tests are based from the notes in class. He prints class notes & study guide [near exact copies of the tests] out for you so you can save your ca$h(no text book).
