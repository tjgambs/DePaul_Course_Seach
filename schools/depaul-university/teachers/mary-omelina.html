No tests, no readings, no writings. all you have to do is massive work on Maya. She gives helpful feedback, let u redo assignments. she doesn't force u to do what she wants, she lets u show ur creativity. I love her reactions when she gets surprised by our work. she really makes u feel u did something impressive. :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2014<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mary is a NICE professor, and the homework she gave us were pretty interesting.

She actually has 20 of real life animation. She is really helpful if you are getting stuck and lets you follow her on the computer during class, so basically there is no homework if you follow along. I still email her for help with animation even though the class is done and she still helps me. She's great!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
