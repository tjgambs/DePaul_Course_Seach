	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

Maybe you should find out more about him before making such false statements!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dont agree with the negative comments on Dr. Parra. He is very nice, grades easy. All you need to do is go to class, do the work, get an A....um hello&#63; thats what college is</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class.  Rough part was that there were 4 grades all quarter.  Prof. Parra encourages students to go to office hours -- go if you have a problem -- it's worth it!  Gives quality notes.  If you put forth the effort, you should do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This Professor is REALLY BAD-I thought that he may be different actually taking the course but I was wrong!!! Like half of the class dropped it. Save yourself time and MONEY and DONT take this class!!!  You will regret it. He is NOT helpful at all even in his office hours.  DePaul needs to FIRE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, but he makes it difficult with his poor grasp of the english language and loads of busywork. Attendence is optional, but I would go because the book sucks.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2005<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy sucks, the work load for this basic chem class is insane, i dont think he understands that students have more classes than his crappy chem class. If you like doing tons of work for no reason take this class, otherwise i would advise to avoid this man. 1 more thing his english is terrible</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2005<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>simply put.....do not take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2005<br>Class Name: CHE192<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wasn't clear or helpful even when I went for help.  He just reitterated what the book said without really explaining.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2005<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Parra will help you with anything as long as you take the time to actually go see him.  He posts tests online, and a lot of the questions he gives show up on the exams (verbatim)... so do them!!! This is a difficult course, but Dr. Parra is fair-He curved the exams and the final grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You need to do the practice problems, practice tests and quizzes, and read the book. That's it. Yes, I admit his accent is alittle strong, but if you sit up front, it's not too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOOK AT THE FINAL GUYS IT WAS EASY...ITS ALL THREE OF THE TEST HE HAD CORRECTED AT HOME THEE MAN THROUGH US A BONE</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The course is made extremely hard due to the fact that you have to teach yourself the material since Parra is completely inadequate as a teacher.  Lectures and example problems are straight from the book.  The exams are the hardest exams I've ever had in my life.  He acts like he hates his students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2004<br>Class Name: CHE133<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had no clue what he was talking about. Wasn't very helpful in his office hours. Doesn't know how to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very helpful - encourages you to come to his office hours, makes test banks, practice exams, posts notes and all material online, but as a teacher he really lacks good communication skills. keep yourself on track and don't fall behind or you don't have a chance at passing his exams.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Is extremely unclear. He is friendly, and more than easy to talk to. He will do his best to try and make you understand things, but he is slightly limited by the fact that he is too smart for the material and doesn't relate it well to someone who has no clue. If you're not gonna try hard, dont take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>3 test 1 final 1 lab final, very helpful, go to class, sit in front seats to understand, test are just like practice testbanks and practice test. Overall i really like him as a teacher. He knows what he's doing, Plus awesum 10% curves!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's actually a decent teacher, students in his class just dont try. He is a nice man who does good research and is willing to help if you ask. The material is extremely easy, and can easily be mastered. We just have a lot of stupid people in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher! STAY AWAY! easier to teach yourself from the book than having to sit in on one of his really really long and boring lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you put the effort in the class you are almost guarenteed at least a B. He creats practice test that are exactly like the exams.  He does have an accent but is understandable.  If you have questions, stop by his office and he'll answer them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ohh ruben parra a good guy but us students dont really care for that. he is hard to understand b/c of his accent. not good teacher and not bad. make sure you get help outside the class or you wont do real well</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2004<br>Class Name: CHE215<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Did not demonstrate knowledge of the subject matter.
