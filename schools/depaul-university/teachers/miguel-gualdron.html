He is a very tough grader when it comes to your papers, so good luck trying to figure that out. I participated every class and still only got a 50% participation grade (I attended every class).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2015<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pros - you don't have to buy any textbooks, all the readings are posted and you just print them out; there is no midterm or final (only 4 papers) Cons - he has a thick accent and it takes a while to think what he wants to say; drags on the class (never let us out early); really boring class; harsh grader for a class that's intro to philosophy, </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Gualdron comes across as a nice young man, and in reality he is. However, his heavy Spanish accent makes it very difficult to understand him. His lectures are quite long and are often completely unrelated to the reading. His paper-grading is inconsistent, as I could never predict what grade I would receive. Participation grade is crazy too.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
