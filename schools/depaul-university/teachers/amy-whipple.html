Although the content of the class is extremely dry, the homework is easy and she tries to keep it as exciting as possible. 2 papers, and a midterm/final with a written and multiple choice portion. Grades tough on papers but if you study it should be easy to get a good grade in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2006<br>Class Name: HST217236293<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken her for 3 class and I think she is a great teacher. Papers are short (1-3 pages) and so is the reading. She gives out study guides for the MidTerm and Final, what more can you ask for! Lectures are short and to the point although they do happen each class. Also we got let out early almost every class. Deffinetly take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2006<br>Class Name: HST236<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont take this class in the morning or after a 8:30am morning class!!! Expect to be taking notes ALL class session!!!! Overall interesting class, but too much note-taking!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really made this class interesting!  Her lectures were really good, but be prepared to write the whole time.  Tests were pretty easy, and she was an easy grader on the writing assingments, which were at the most 2 pages.  Def. take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2006<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>in the beginning of the semester she would let us out early, then she stopped except for when she was sick.. graded like and english teacher and took FOREVER to finally post grades- 2 weeks after the final. Other than that she was clear with her lectures and precise with info.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smart and helpful, took as a night class and you always get out about an hour early.  Makes her lectures simple to understand, fairly easy grader, overall, an interesting class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2006<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just loved her class. For night class she let us out early almost every single time and more importantly she is a great professor.  Lectures are intresting, she is able to convey a lot of information in a short period of time.  A credit to DePaul, you need to take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2006<br>Class Name: HST217293<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is by far one of the easiest graders for a history teacher at DePaul ever! She always lets class out early, and basically if you go to class and pay attention you'll get a B on the Mid-Term & Final. Assignments are usually 1-2 pages and again graded easily. Plus she's always there to help if you have a question.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Can you say BOOOOOOOOORING&#63;! Ugh, I hate history enough and this lady made it a lot worse! She lectures the entire time, hard to participate.. Tough grader, but if you study hard for the midterm and final, you can get an okay grade. (weekly papers due, a midterm, a final, and a huge amount of reading) Take if your due for a nap!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2006<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor but very tough grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awww. whipple. nice, smart, lenient, but the boringest damn lecturer. not a lot of work though, easy papers. Got a B without doing much work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Aww, I loved her. One of the most helpful professors I've had, she always took the time to give me a good answer to my questions even if there was a line of students waiting to talk to her. She doesn't tear you apart on grading either, I had never taken European history before and I got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2005<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Went to two classes and got a B+ - but don't take my example! The classes i went to were fun, the material understandable and informative, and she is very helpful and prepares the class well. If you already have a good understanding of European history, like me, you may and probably will be bored a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2005<br>Class Name: BRITISHHISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was alright; not hard at all; very boring; she missed huge events about the history of Britian; if you take her don't be a slacker. She is not tough at all. Lectures are alright sometimes boring. She makes you read novels that have little to do with the material. She's wierd and sometimes is not willing to talk to studets. Overall she alright.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2005<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm a history major which I have to say there are better history teachers out there. She lectures and the note taking is insane because she doesnt really say what is important or not but only tells until you took down a page of notes (too late) but lets you out early. A good easy teacher if you work but I wouldnt recommend her for history.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this was a good class. ms whipple is a great teacher who is really passionate about history and knows her stuff. 4 small 1-2 page papers, midterm and final exam that is terms/essay question format. easy stuff, but requires some studying and memorizing of what the terms are. i thought i was gonna have an A, but ended up with a B+. recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Whipple is great!  She's such an informative and helpful professor.  If you miss a class, you just have to go in and see her and she will fill you in.  She is a very fair grader, so you must study!  Take her for history!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: HIST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Likes what she does and teaches in the &quot;new school&quot; format. Doesn’t take attendance, but also makes it worthwhile to come. In addition has true passion for history, your Grade depends on you she gives you info to get a “A”</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whipple is the NICEST professor ever, she is incredibly helpful and sweet. She is really passionate about history and knows SO much. Lectures are pretty intense but she always ends class early. Work load is easy, she is a fair grader, exams required definite studying but they are not extremely hard. Definitely recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2005<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice lady.  Pleasant, helpful, and considerate. Work load not heavy, great notes, very knowledgable. She is passionate for history and really creates a stress free environment. I would definitely take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: HST293<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this class! She was so enthused about history that it never seemed boring at all! She is a fair and easy grader.  She is nice, very helpful, and even lets u out early on fridays! I got an A w/no problem, i highly reccomend you take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: HST293<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm a senior history major so I know the good history teachers from the bad. She is very good. I didn't know much about British history but now I do. Her lectures are very clear and organized. I would highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: HIS217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her class. I had a good background in world history before i attended her class, so it was a very easy, yet still stimulating class. I would recommend her without any reservations.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows what she is talking about but her classes are just lectures and are not that interesting.  Tests were easy if you did the study guide and the best part about the class is you never have to go and you can still easily pull of a decent grade!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: ENGHST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the nicest professors I have had so far. Her lectures are very clear; just go to class and take good notes and you should do fine. Highly recommended!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, just go to class, take notes, and you'll score a decent grade.

Her impassioned lectures are infused with  a genuine exuberence the likes of which I have yet to see in another professor, regardless of the field.

Her lectures are very detailed, but you don't need to know All of the details for the midterm/final. She gets straight to the point and emphasizes the important events. Very organized and helpful.  The book is helpful to read and it's easy to follow.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2004<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SO VERY BORING.

She knows history can be dry and tried to spice it up with some alternative reading material. Easy A. TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2004<br>Class Name: 217<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor. Always in a good mood and makes things clear. Willing to help and easy assignments. She gave us 5 writing assignments that only had to be a paragraph long! I strongly recommend her class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2004<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a new professor and she's really nice. Always available for extra help. History is not my favorite subject and she made it very clear and easy for me to learn the material and get a good grade in the class. If you're interested in modern history this is the class to take!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2004<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice teacher, good lectures, i am getting an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2004<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes a sweetheart</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2004<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
