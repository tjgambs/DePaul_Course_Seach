He lectures and talks extremely fast but also plays some sort of screening every class making half the class movie time. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2015<br>Class Name: MCS342<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stadle is very smart. He holds prestigious degrees and rambles on and on flexing his vocabulary every chance he can. He is distant but helpful. He assigns ungodly papers. If you are taking this history class because it sounds easy, don't. He is one of those professors who expects you to have as deep an interest in the subject as him. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2015<br>Class Name: MCS342<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was really interesting and not too stressful. We got to watch a bunch of shows. Lectures are long but interesting. Luke is really nice, knowledgeable, and passionate about TV. The readings are pretty dry but he is always willing to help and is clear about what he expects from us which he tells us on day 1. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2015<br>Class Name: MCS342<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Usually an hour of lecture followed by videos. Get ready to read, an average of at least 3 readings given per week. There are three reading responses, and then theres the midterm, final paper and final exam. He's a nice guy, pretty easy, interesting class. No textbooks needed for class, all readings posted online.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
