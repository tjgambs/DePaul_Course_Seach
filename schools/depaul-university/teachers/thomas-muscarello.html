It's an internship-class so he just wanted weekly write ups. No excuses on late assignments though, also didn't give feedback to me at all. Felt like I was feeding a grading machine. Couldn't be contacted at all.  Made me think, but he could put the assignments online, not teach, and have the same resulting class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought Proffessor Muscarello was easy going. Helpful when you have questions. I personally like his style, though he talks a bit quiet. Assignments are clear and easy. We get assigned what we cover in class. I have personally learned a lot about making a web page, but you need to put in your personal initiative.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2011<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Muscarello is awesome. His classes revolve around discussing current event topics he makes you bring in. He is very knowledgeable in the subject but can be dry at times when he goes on tangents. Two easy analytical assignments, take home midterm and 10 pg final paper. Very easy going guy. Very highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: CSC250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easiest A you could possibly get at depaul university. he's so laid back, the course work is so easy, and he gives you 100% on everything as long as you do the work. there's a midterm, group project, take home test, and the final is optional. highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2009<br>Class Name: CSC250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best guy ever. He is so laid back, but he can be a LITTLE boring at time. You don't need to show up for class and all of his lectures are video recorded online so you can watch them from your own computer without having to show up. You can turn in any homework online (there's barely any)...2 tests, 1 project, no final. Easiest grader. TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: CSC250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor at Depaul, Very nice and smart</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: CSC250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great guy, awesome teacher..laid back class, homework assignments due once a week, get a bit tough towards the last month but otherwise easy..2 tests, final is optional for extra credit..attendance not mandatory..take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: DC270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class on tough guy films is awesome!

Prof is an older, very caring guy who just talks the entire class while everyone plays on the computer and leaves at halftime (sad). He tries hard and cares about his students, yet is a bit slow. However can be funny. Final optional as extra credit. Wants students to just learn!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2006<br>Class Name: IS556<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Made the class interesting by providing interesting case study readings. Lectures were primarily discussions from the readings.  Engages the class in discussion.  Very fair grader and extremely knowledgeable about the subject.  Has tons of experience in the industry and has very enlightening stories that he shares from his past job experiences.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: CSC250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel so bad for this man because he really is interested in this subject, and he wants the students to be interested, but it just doesn't end up that way.  However, he's SO nice and laid back, and some of the material is interesting.  Take him if you want an easy going professor who actually likes what he is teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2006<br>Class Name: CSC250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A.
