She is by far one of the BEST professors at depaul.  She is extremely helpful and very into her topics. I can not wait to have another class with her! She is very understanding, straight forward and interested in her students lives--which is rare to find in some professors.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2009<br>Class Name: PHL394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was my fave prof at DePaul.

(That comment from 4/12/09 that says &quot;this woman&quot; is just rude-and wrong.) She has been incredibly helpful for understanding the concepts of philosophy. She brings great energy and love for philosophy to her teaching. She gets students to really think and express themselves. Take her classes-you will see!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2009<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is now my favorite professor at DePaul!  She is a great teacher and really makes you think.  Don't be afraid to take her philosophy class about death.  It can be very heavy at times but its well worth it.

Make sure you do your readings because she knows if don't read and she also takes note if you don't have the readings with you.She &quot;tears&quot; apart papers BUT will help you with the revisions.

She is very understanding and knows what she is talking about although her views may conflict with her students' she wants her students to be able to defend their views with clearcut information. A LOT of reading but I got an A w/o reading it all</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's a very nice and understaning person. all she wants from her students is to communicate their thoughts in a rational way; to question; and, finally, to show intellectual curiosity. class participation is expected, and there's too much reading to do.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Goswami is a passionate teacher who expects her students to tackle difficult issues with research, intelligence, and an open mind. She's by far the best professor I've had at DePaul and if I were a philosophy major I'd take any class with her I could.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2004<br>Class Name: PHY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is really intimidating at first but it is jusy a front, she is actually really rasy and cool.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2004<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is awesome.

She's an intelligent, erudite (yet vulgar), passionate, vegetarian, chain smoker and somewhat obsessed with her cats. Not sure if I'd take her again, but certainly enjoyed the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2004<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fiercely intelligent, bitingly honest and aware of current events, Dr. Goswami made it known that if you were unable to back up your comments made during discussions, don't bother speaking. Wonderful professor and person.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everyone saide it all.

She is someone you will learn something from. Everyone got an A on their mideterm in our class because she helped us understand the material and made us do the best we could! She even came to our review session for mids!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes the best! The whole class got either an A or A+ on the Midterm cuz it was that easy. She talks to us like any other student would, more of as a friend than a professor. Shes sooo nice, down to earth and cool!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Goswami teaches in a very comprehensive way in that she expresses herself not as a professor or someone who is in a position of power over her students but rather as one of our peers. She encourages her students to express themselves in the same way..</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2004<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't understand how anyone can give her a rating under a 4.  Most helpful teacher I ever had.  I had to drop Philosophy classes before because of being lost, but she did not allow me to get lost.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid this teacher like the plague. She's too serious and VERY pushy with her ideas. It'd be easier to understand her if she wasn't trying to push her opinions on the class while teaching.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body><script>
