I was happy to take this class with Dr. Brown because of all the things I heard about he, and want to add that she is so smart but never arrogant and that is perfect for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2014<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>I am in this class right now and just want to say that since you have to take this class you should take it with Dr. Brown. She is so down to earth and really encouraging. I never thought I'd say that methods is one of my favorite classes. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>The best thing about soc at DePaul is Dr. Brown! This class was required and I wasn't looking forward to it because it's a basic one. But I have to hand it to Dr. Brown that she makes the material so interesting. I think that she could read you a shopping list and it would be great because she's so funny and wonderful to interact with. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2014<br>Class Name: SOC205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest course I've ever taken. Each week consisted of two posts and a 10 question quiz; that was it. There was also a midterm and final paper that didn't require citations. Robyn is super nice too and e-mails every week to check in. She also picks topics that are genuinely interesting. Definitely take this course if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2014<br>Class Name: SOC205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class and teacher. Online version is very straightforward and does not have strenuous work. Weekly reading, discussion post, and quiz. Midterm and final are mini essay questions. The book is required but it is a great textbook. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2014<br>Class Name: SOC381<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She is probably the best teacher I have had at DePaul. She is very helpful and gives you a lot of time for papers and projects in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: SOC353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved everything about this class. I needed an elective and this worked with my schedule but ended up being one of the best I've taken at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2013<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>It's methods. I was not looking forward it but I think it will be the most useful Sociology class I'll take. I've liked learning how to do my own research and loves the way Dr. Brown walks you through each step. I am taking two classes with her next quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: SOC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is wonderful, awesome and super sweet! Best class as of Families!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2013<br>Class Name: SOC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>fantastic teacher and genuinely interested in all of her students. she somehow remembers even the weirdest facts about you and is always available for help out of the classroom. She makes a discussion class fun and easy to participate in (something I struggle with). I'm taking her for another class next term.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2013<br>Class Name: SOC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best! I have taken a few classes with her and am now in the families class. Whenever I see her, I just smile and know I'm going to love what she has to say.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2012<br>Class Name: SOC205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Brown is one of my favorite professors at DePaul. I love how she puts everyone at ease and LOVED the openness of this class. The class discussions were the most valuable part of this class for me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2012<br>Class Name: SOC205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am in my second year at DePaul and I feel like this class is the first I've had that is what I thought college would be like. We actually discuss things instead of being told what to study. I LOVE Dr. Brown. She is a riot, just imagine Tina Fay as a professor and you have a good idea. If you take this class you won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: SOC353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just finished another great class with Dr. Brown. I love her classes. There are no tests in her class  but lots of papers and this seems to work out that I do a bit better than in other classes. She gives rubrics and great feedback so you know where you stand.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2011<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Brown is easily my favorite teacher at DePaul. She is extremely informative but very laid back. The class is early in the morning but I actually want to attend because the class is so enjoyable (I never thought I would feel that way about research methods!). I honestly believe it is impossible to dislike her. She is awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2011<br>Class Name: SOC353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken two classes with Dr. Brown and they're both easily the best classes I've taken at DePaul but this is my favorite. I pretty much register based on what she's teaching. But, to warn you, despite the laidback Southern vibe she has, she expects you to work hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2011<br>Class Name: SOC205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class and I really liked Prof. Brown.  She's serious about teaching the material, but she's laidback enough to let you really soak it in rather than cram.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2011<br>Class Name: SOC205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly recommend this class to anyone even remotely interested in Sociology or Psychology! I would take this class and this professor again in a heartbeat!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
