Gives you optional homework problems after each lecture to sharpen your skills. Definitely do these problems! He will take the time to go over them with you and the problems he assigns are the same ones that show up on the exams. Take good notes and you'll get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2015<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm & final are the only grades you get. No textbook required. Gives you nothing but material that will be on tests. No time wasted. Lectures from start to end and sometimes a few minutes later. Very long and hard to sit through at times. No breaks either. He is great in that he gives you nothing but the important material. A little goofy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2015<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Not too bad! You DO NOT need the book. Only grades are midterm (40%) and final (60%), both are which are tests, all multiple choice. The practice tests are IDENTICAL to the tests, just different scenarios. Epstein loves Econ, though his lectures get boring. Absences don't matter but he takes attendance in case you are between grades. Great person.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2015<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Least favorite professor I've ever had at DePaul. Lectures are boring and confusing, he assumes you already know everything about economics, and the grade is just based off of the midterm and the final. No participation, no homework, no quizzes. Sounds like a dream but actually just screws you over big time. Not accessible to students for help.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2014<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>There are two tests. Midterm and Cumulative Final. Funny guy, but I could see why some would not like his lecturing style due to political tangents. Pretty low class average for the final, and there is a lot of note taking needed. No homework aside from problems he gives you to assist you in studying. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not take a class with him as my professor again. He doesn't provide readings or any homework- so you think it would be an easy class...but come midterm and final time and it screws you over. Doesn't have office hours.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2014<br>Class Name: ECON305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good lecturer. What he says and puts as homework on the board usually was on the exams.  Doesn't like to spend time with students outside of class.  Not really an "above and beyond professor." Not the kind of professor you'd want if you're someone who seeks more attention and help.  Really bummed me out on becoming an Econ major.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult subject matter and Dr. Epstein moves through it quickly. All the test questions come from lectures-NO NEED for the book.Very difficult and harsh grader and the tests are not multiple choice. He gives no answers for the homework and that could be very frustrating. I feel I should have received and A but instead received a B+. ruined my GPA</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2013<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is a bit difficult for a 100-level class. Topics move by very quickly. Epstein is very knowledgeable toward current events. And so he requires about 7-8 blog entries throughout the quarter. A 5mn news presentation is a must for everyone. Midterm and Final are multiple choice but a bit tricky. Say you're from MN and you should start good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dude is pretty legit. His class isn't hard at all. You dont' need the book because his exams are all based from the stuff he teaches in class. Take good notes, pay attention, and brush up on your calculus (differential equations) if need be. Overall, the guy is mad legit.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He may seem hard and literally insane. He is very lenient when grading.

He teaches with personality and a lot of energy. Most of the time, he's yelling to make a point, but he keeps you interested. He also loves to discuss topics and real life economics problems outside of class. Very cool guy, very pragmatic</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2011<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Average teacher, lectures consist of rewriting his notes on the white board.  Grading is a bit erratic but averages out ended up getting a better final grade than I thought I would get going into the final.  He has a dry sense of humor which kept things somewhat entertaining. If math isn't your thing it will take a lot of out of class studying.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2011<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good Prof.  Gives HW with no solutions.  Scattered lectures.  Talks fast.  Harsh grader.  Doesn't seem to care about students.  Acts like he is doing a job that he is sick of.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Look. The class is hard. It is mathematically challenging. BUT, if you work hard, go to his office to ask questions and go over the homework, you'll be fine!! Not an easy class by any means but not impossible to get an A either.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult class. Do not buy the textbook. I did, but we never used it. Epstein is a challenging professor. If you're looking for an easy A, then don't take him. You really need to work outside of class and set meetings to discuss the hw. In the end, I learned quite a bit.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2011<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're good at teaching yourself and are well-versed in the mathematical principles of economics, you'll be fine. If not, find another professor. He is very thorough, just a lot of course material to remember when the midterms and final come around.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2011<br>Class Name: ECON305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy was as bad as it gets. No info on D2l and gives you homework without any solutions. Tough grader, always chewing something and talking making it at time difficult to make out and doesn't really care about the students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2011<br>Class Name: ECON305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most difficult professors I have had at DePaul. hmwk is practically useless b/c he does not give you the answers to the problems. Midterms 25% each final 50%. He goes through the work quickly and is scattered when teaching. 5 questions on midterm takes 1 1/2 hrs to complete. AVOID PROFESSOR esp if ur a senior</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2010<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decent teacher, but the class is backloaded, so come finals time he tries to squeeze in as much information as he can. Two midterms, each 25% of your grade, and the final (comprehensive) is worth 50%. Don't buy the book</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most disorganized professors I have ever had. He teaches off notes he wrote decades earlier. He randomly gives a homework problem here and there throughout class. He never bothered to think to print out there sheets ahead of time. He grades harshly as well. His clarity leaves much to be desired. I would never take a class from him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Epstein is hilarious. He makes a class that would normally be boring very entertaining. Attend class and pratice homework probs and you will be fine. Do not buy the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very detailed teacher, who taught math really well to those without previous calculus experience.  Only downside was not enough business applications.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class and great professor. If you attend class, take good notes, and do the problems he assigns, you'll do fine. He told us a handful of exam questions, word for word. No surprises. Definitely one of the best professor's I've had at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will do well as long as you go to class, take notes, and do the homework.  Don't bother buying the book.  He will take the time to answer your questions inside and outside of class.  I enjoyed his sarcastic humor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2009<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Professor. 2 Midterms 1 Final, all multiple choice. Tests were based strictly off the notes, don't even bother buying the book. Easy A if you show up to class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Epstein was funny and knowledgable.  He had a tendency to mumble and trail off at the end of sentences sometimes, but that's my only complaint.  He explained the material clearly and was willing to answer any questions that were asked.  Also kept things interesting and lightened the mood with his talk of current events.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seth Epstein is a terrific teacher.  He really knows the material, and does a great job of simplifying complex concepts to make them easier to understand.  Grade is based on two midterms and a final, and all exam material is from homework and notes.  On a personal level, Seth has a great way of lightening the content, and making it entertaining.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing Professor.  I didn't think it would be possible to make Calculus & Statistics very exciting but he found a way to do it.  He found subtle ways to teach the fundamentals of the course along with tying applications to the theory.  If you are good at math, you'll love his passion and work.  If you are not good at math, you're head may spin.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2008<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lot of material to cover & Professor keeps a quick pace.  Exams are predominantly math / statistical problems not word definitions.  Prepare for tests by working problems in book &  focus on study guide (most helpful).  Class worth taking, Professor available to cover tough problems. Be prepared to spend a lot of hours (full days) studying.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2008<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Class, Lot of material to cover and Professor needs to keep a quick pace.  The exams are predominantly math / statistical problems not word definitions.  The best way to prepare the tests is to practice problems in the book and study guide.

Make sure you attend every class and take notes. There were 2 midterms and one final. Exam questions were from the notes and were easy! I would recommend this professor for GSB 420.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult learning environment if you never had calc or stats before. Sometimes makes fun of people for asking questions.  Doesn't go over homework so partner with someone to help you. Textbook isn't that helpful. Tests are mainly off homework.  He does let you out early, but there is no break. He doesn't use blackboard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very bad experience.  He knows the material but often lectures to the board and mumbles things to himself.  Doe not use Blackboard nor does his syllabus provide much useful information. Tests are challenging and based entirely on the lectures. Forget the book.  Probably a brilliant researcher but one of the worst prof at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a journalism undergraduate, I didn't know much about Economics. Epstein actually takes the time to go through the concepts step by step. You must attend class. Forget about the book. Don't be afraid to ask questions or stop by afterwards. You must put an effort into this class, but it's clear what you need to know for the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2007<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy made economics pretty interesting and theres only 2 midterms and a final. Gives practice exams a week before each one and the final is a bunch of questions from the 1st 2 exams. 90% of the test content comes from class notes so its real easy if u attend class.all around woulda gotten an A if i studied more for the 1st test</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2007<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable about Econ. Some material is highly technical, but aids in understanding the concepts, which I used a LOT in later classes. The format is standard: homework, midterm, final. You need to be in class each week, take notes & copy charts/graphs from board, and you'll need to know how & why things work. Overall, better than average.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2007<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the worst professor ever, but is definitely not my favorite. He at least speaks clear English at least which is hard to come by at DePaul. He doesn't explain the material very well and buying the book is practically a waste of 100 dollars. He chomps on his gum EVERY class period and is BORING. Tests don't match what you learn.Would not take aga</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2007<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult to do well if you miss any classes.  He moves quickly and covers material not in the book.  Therefore you don't always know what your missing.  Found this to be by far the most difficult yet taken.

This guy is THE BEST at explaining the material. I think there's just Dr. Epstein and Gabriela &quot;The Butcher&quot; Bucci teaching 305. Take Epstein. All you gotta do is come to class and take real good notes. My notes are 132 pages. Seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2004<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST TEACHER IVE EVER HAD AND I HAVE SEEN THEM ALL.

Some questions are tricky. I didn't have to buy the book. I just studied his notes and did fair. He laughs at his own unfunny jokes and he always chews gum while he gives lectures (annoying).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2004<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an OK teacher.
