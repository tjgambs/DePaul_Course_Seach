The great thing about this game was being able to play great fun games and write papers about them, while also using Dr.Zagal's book that is insightful and easy to read.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: GAM205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jose's definitely not an easy A, you'll earn your grade for sure.

He teach us like we are computer geeks like he is. I took this class as an INTRODUCTION but it felt more like a 300 major class. Unfair grader and stupid hard exams. I hope they took him off depaul faculty, if not STAY AWAY</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2010<br>Class Name: GAM101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just took Ethics in Cinema and Video Games with Zagal. I've heard that this is a great class, but his way of teaching it focused more on the ethics side. He is a pretty fair grader on the homework and I learned a lot. However, his tests are difficult, require you to read, and he is not a fair grader for them. A lot of the class did not do well.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
