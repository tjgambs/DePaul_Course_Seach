His lectures and his values come from the heart, and you can see it with every class he gives. There isn't a day where he doesn't care about his students and the impact his students can make on the world. If you also care, it's an easy A, if not, then just do the work and give some kind of insight.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hughes is a great teacher, I really learned a lot in his class. He is not a tough grader at all. The homework he gives out are 4 reflective journals and about every other week you will present with your group on the books he assigned you. And there is one final paper. There were no quizzes and tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE HIM! No matter what your major is, take any class of his. He is the best professor at DePaul and one of my inspirations in life. He teaches you critical thinking, something not many teachers do anymore.

Marcus usually would expose a "truth" every class and honestly it was great. I always left that class wanting to make a change. It was mostly lecture and just as easy and interesting. He's a great guy and I would love to take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>I remember our first class topic, "What is a mask?". We were taught to remove our invisible mask and accept other people's opinions and views. I learned lessons that I could carry for the rest of my life. I would recommend anyone and everyone to take at least one of his classes. They have changed the way I look at life.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Marcus is dedicated to teaching his students the truth in a wide variety of subjects (food industry, bias in historical writing, educational movements around the world, subliminal messages).  I always went to class because I didn't want to miss his lectures which more closely resemble discussions in which the voice of each student is valued.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2015<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I have had at DePaul! He tries to give his students all the knowledge he has and also learns from the students as well. I never felt uncomfortable to speak in class and ask questions. I learned about myself as a future educator and as a human being. I hope to bring as much positivity and enjoyment to my classroom! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the best teacher I have had at DePaul. He is willing to help you with everything. Super understanding, brings out the best in his students especially in group discussions, and he makes you want to be a better person. If i could I would take it again. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a charismatic individual.  Teaches students to think critically and be aware of their surroundings.  He is also pretty funny.  Laid back class with a lot of classroom discussions and presentations.  The class is really what you make out of it.  You can learn a lot or you can just drift on by. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hughes is without a doubt one of my favorite people I've come across.

Great guy in general.  He makes the class environment very comfortable and laid back.  Discusses things that are happening NOW - things students want to really hear about.  It made us all want to go to class.  He's always there for additional help or if you need support or just someone to chat with.  Few assignments. Easy. Fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Trust me, you wouldn't want to miss class he speaks the truths and you have to be open minded to his outlook on the world. If money wasn't tight I would be more than happy to take all the classes he offers. Very funny individual and will have a high impact on your way of thinking. You won't regret taking this class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hughes is not only a great professor, but an even better human being with a unique outlook on the world. Values ideas over intelligence.  One of the few classes I have ever looked forward to attending.  His worldview is radical but inspiring. His personal transparency created an open and accepting environment.  Take his class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Marcus is the best professor I took so far.

Prof Hughes allows students to learn a lot from him and even more from their peers. His class may seem easy, but he challenges you to think critically in ways you have not done before and about things you would not normally think about. Great man and Prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2014<br>Class Name: 200704<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Hughes's class was always very interesting and engaging.  He would present information to the class (regarding issues from education to the food industry to perceptions of youth) and facilitate a class discussion.  He is very passionate about sharing knowledge to empower students.  Never wanted to miss class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Recommend.

There is much to lean  from Marcus as he is definitely a breath of fresh air. You will get a piece of mind in his class and will come out of the class not only having info about the class but the "GAME" as he referred to. He is the real deal, i highly recommend him for any classes. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200906<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hughes taught me something you can't just read from a text book. I learned more than I ever could have imagined. He challenges your mind with critical thinking questions, which as a senior in college, I haven't truly been challenged since this class.

I learned about what's going on in the world today and how I am affected, not useless stuff I don't care about and will never use. Class discussions were super open and low pressure. Overall really superb teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Hughes' class changed my life for the better- I am not kidding!

He's more of a friend than a teacher. He's much more concerned with hearing what you make of the course material than testing you on it. One of the most interesting men I've ever met. He will genuinely change the way you look at our government and social constructs. A philosophical genius.. TAKE THIS CLASS, DAMMIT!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down best professor at DePaul.
