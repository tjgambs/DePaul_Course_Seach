Worst teacher ever. You take 10 quizzes throughout the quarter and it only accounts for 10% of your grade, and on top of that her grading is beyond terrible. You write 2-3 page papers every other week after reading 3-4 lengthy case studies and you end up with 50% papers after answering her questions and following rubic.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This class isn't that bad.
