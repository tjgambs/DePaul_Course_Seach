I panic on tests and he was more than accommodating. Make sure to take the study guide seriously because he picks a few questions from it for the exams. Also, you can submit things early and get feedback before doing papers. He has a super dry sense of humor, so be prepared. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an interesting person, good teacher overall, but He is a hard grader and expects a lot, the class was hard to follow and you really have to focus and take more than 6 hours or more weekly if you want to do well. It was too much work and I don't feel I learned much from it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: PSC390<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wish I had not taken this professor. He is an interesting person, but this class was not enjoyable. He is a hard grader, and his pet peeve is poor grammar. This is not an easy course, nor do I feel like I got much out of it. Wish I had taken something else.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2013<br>Class Name: PSC223<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bennett is the worst professor at DePaul university.  He gives out grades arbitrarily.  He also does not expect his students to think.  Just read assignments and regurgitate material.  That is all.  Never, ever take this professor if you care about making controversial topics or seek to make systemic changes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: PSC223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bennett's Urban Politics course was far more interesting that I thought it would be. There's a lot of reading but it's worth it (including a book on the politics of Disney World, awesome). He is super knowledgeable and engaging, every question is worth seriously exploring to him, doesn't blow off questions to stick to his plan. Def. recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2010<br>Class Name: PSC223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bennett is an alright teacher, he gives you a chance if your willing to learn. The class isn't a blow off class or and easy ride. If you apply yourself and actually read the material and understand it you can learn a lot from him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was a difficult, yet entertaining class. He seemed really interested in the subject and always had interesting comments and facts. Yes, he is a hard grader but he's actually trying to push you and get the best grade possible. I used to have zero interest in political science, and now i like it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2009<br>Class Name: POL214<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you found yourself reading a negative rating of this professor due to his grading, throw that out the window. Bennett will listen to you no matter your view and he will push you. If you want to produce great work you can be proud of take Prof. Bennett. He is a great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: PSC216<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is a tough grader, but I guarantee you that you will learn more in this class than any other class if you skim over the reading before coming to class. I got a B in this class. He's an extremely helpful professor if you show that you actually want to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2008<br>Class Name: POL323<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! Its so boring  - plus too many expectations with your writing skills. The final consists of essay questions and a final paper. Each essay question has like 6-7 questions in the question. Too much work and such a boring class! If you don't participate every day more than once don't expect a good grade!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: PSC322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There was tons of reading but class discussions helped clarify everything. He handed out everything you needed to know for the midterm and final a week before, and he was extremely helpful if you needed anything. If you like being challenged, this is the professor for you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty good teacher. Can be dull at times but overall helps you really learn the material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2008<br>Class Name: PSC390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For a senior capstone, I had a great time.  Meet a lot of cool people in the class, discussion was usually pretty good.  In addition to having class at a bar every week, you really can't go wrong.  Bring your brain and beer money, you will enjoy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2007<br>Class Name: PSC216<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the worst prof at depaul. when asked to view a movie and interpret it he will tell you you're wrong...on you own interpretation! this is just the beginning. he's rude, needlessly criticizes student's opinions and tells you what is right nevermind it is most often his own slant. he gives youlittle chance to prove yourself academically.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty interesting. you can tell the prof has a good sense of humor and his lecture is a little monotone but he spikes it with some cleverness and stuff. Overall the assignments were simple and the readings mostly interesting. not too highbrow but obviously not the average depaul teacher either. i would take him again</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: PSC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hey is a ****bag...but you love him for it. He grades tough but explains himself. If you have questions, he is easy to catch after class. He for surely knows what he is talking about...the man eat, breathes, and sleeps political science.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: PSC216<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>American political culture...meh, it was an okay class but ultimately boring.  didnt learn much, just kept talking about the same old stuff that everyone already knew about American politics.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: CAPSTONE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Undoubtedly the best class I took at DePaul.  Class is held in a bar where you discuss a novel or film specified for the class.  50% of grade is participation and presentation, 50% is a 15 page research paper.  LB is an awesome guy and makes the class both fun and challenging.  He's hilarious and brilliant at the same time.  Highly reccomended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2006<br>Class Name: URBANPOLITICS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a hard class. He makes you work for your grade. The class was all lecture, so if you can't take notes on lectures avoid this class. He isn't a dick about grading, he just does a good job of challenging students. The guy is hilarious though and his antics will make you want to go to every class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: CAPSTONE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome class.

His classes are informative and entertaining.  He will assign low grades for deficient work, but will reward you when a reward is warranted.  Class lectures and discussions are never boring and the books assigned are almost always interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: CAPUPOLCHGO<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: PSC322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LB wants students to do well so he pushes and challenges them. once you catch on to his sense of humor (which is awesome and very dry) you'll be fine.

Gave me an F because he claims I plaigerized;I am an English major and know how to write papers and cite sources. He is closed-minded and won't let you argue your side if you diasagree with a grade. No rewrites either and the paper was 30% of my grade. DO NOT TAKE HIM! He should be fired!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2004<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Out of all my teachers, including non political class teachers, Professor Bennet is the only one who doesn't try and shove his own opinions down my throat.

Like others said, has his favorites and that is it.  If you need help, don't ask him.  He will tell you that you are &quot;stupid&quot;.

His knowledge is indefinite and he certainly will give you a college class experience.
