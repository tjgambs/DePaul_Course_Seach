Some of the material gets confusing and you would have to learn it yourself. However, he is very nice and very willing to help if you are struggling with any material. He lets you do the online quizzes over before the quarter ends.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2011<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A JOKE! His teaching, his &quot;credentials&quot;, his education - it's all one big joke! You will learn absolutely nothing ifyou have the patience to sit through the class; his lectures consist of him reading verbatim from the book.
