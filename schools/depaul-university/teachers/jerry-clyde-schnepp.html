My only problem was the exams. The exams are on the slides, and only the slides and can be VERY specific. My suggestion - in class (or out of) take notes on every slide - I'm not kidding - and if you look them over before the test you'll probably get a A/B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2006<br>Class Name: GPH211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really nice and helpful but the photoshop stuff can get complicated and it's hard to be creative when you don't really know what you're doing</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2006<br>Class Name: GPH211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy was cool and relaxed. just do the projects well and read this powerpoint slides and u will do good in the exams. fun class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2006<br>Class Name: GPH211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jerry is a great professor! Very helpful, always availabable, funny and really cute! Most of the class is photoshop stuff and all the assignments and projects are photoshop related, the midterem and exam are hard but passable. 3 major projects and 5 assignments. Classes are kind of boring but all posted on dlweb, so you won't miss anything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: GPH211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Spent 90% of class time teaching Photoshop and 10% on the objectives - made the exams a little difficult.

This class is definitely worth taking!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: GPH211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.
