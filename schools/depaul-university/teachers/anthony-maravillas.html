Loved the fact that we could use notes on the tests, sometimes having to remember everything for a class can be difficult, he is willing to talk to you if you talk to him.  I would recommend him, i enjoyed the class, even though it was at 8:30</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: HIST<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy sucks.  he's a jerk, very patronizing, and arrogant.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2005<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Maravillas is kind of intimidating at first, but take 2 seconds out to talk with him and you'll realize he's a great professor who really wants to help out his students.  He's given me two full sized text books to look over and use once I become a teacher.  He makes getting good grades painfully easy.  You even get to use notes on the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the last person.  He really seemed unprepared for class.   What a waste of time and money!!!  Came out of the class tha same way I came in, learned nothing new...  If one doesn't want to learn anything new, this is the class for you....</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2005<br>Class Name: HIST280<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EZ course. Sadly he let the class go way too early each session because he had to get to work - he is  an attendant at United Airlines and so he spent little time preparing for class and even less time with us in class. Waste of time and money if you really want to learn the material. I did enjoy working out with him at the gym.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2005<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Maravillas is awesome.  You learn a lot if you actually listen... this guy knows his stuff.  The reason he hangs out with the guys, is because the guys talk to him.  I don't recall one girl trying to converse with the man in my class.  can't blame him for talking to people who talk to him.  Seems like a lot at first, but stick with it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2005<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't see why ppl are complaining about this professor...i mean come on! he gives us the questions for the exam in advance...lets us USE notes for the exam....lets us out early...and you learn a lot!..those that are complaining are pretty lazy then.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2005<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WOW- This was the easiest class ever!!!  You don't even have to do the readings!!! Just skim them and pick your paper topic!!

Not to mention that Maravillas is extremely personable and quite the character.  For the little time spent in his classroom, I learned A LOT-which is hard to say for some profs.  PARTICIPATION is HUGE in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: UP18001900<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy and tries to connect with you, and does know what he's talking about.  He's a big war buff, and always remembers one characteristic of everyone in the class.  He gives out a lot of papers but they're not that rough.  Just make sure you have good mechanics and actually read the books.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2005<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the guy is overwhelming with all the essays and reading, god i just want to go in and out, not 4 me & most likely not 4 u my friend!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2004<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome professor...if u take this class..u'll enjoy it alot!...he's funny and makes class interesting...he lets you use notes for the test..by far the best teacher i've had at depaul so far</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2004<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredible teacher.

Not chauvinistic, just has a sense of humor about everyone, any sex or color.  He teaches well, and will single you out, but he is helpful in every way.  Everything in this class is easy.  He is a good man.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2004<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny guy, makes lots of references to Hollywood films, and likes to put on a show.  Rather charismatic.  However, he seems rather biased and set in his views of the material.  Lets out class early.
