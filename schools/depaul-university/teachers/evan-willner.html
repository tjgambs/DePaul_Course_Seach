I am neither, so staying until the end of every class and having to buy about 10 books wasn't fun.

I am not a fan..but I'm sure an English major might love him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2009<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE WORST TEACHER AT DEPAUL. he changes his syllabus 3 weeks before the end of the quarter & instead of a revised essay he expects a 7 pg paper. Makes u pay for 8 books plus companion books which we use in class for 10 mins. His assignments are stupid & confusing. He gets mad if u leave class yet you gain nothin from stayin. DONT TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>makes u buy like 8 different books for the class. he is an incredibly hard and unfair grader. if you are not an english major i would not take him. find another class to fill your art and lit req. boring boring boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>rambles on in class and says UMMMM alot. i wouldnt take him again. unless your really into poetry or an english major. 2 papers on a poetry analysis and a final paper that is a revision of either one. takes up alllllll of class time. he never lets you go early</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2009<br>Class Name: ENG369<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher!! really funny and makes a boring class interesting! highly recommend him1 and hes so cute!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2009<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, makes class fun.

We had some great discussions and reade some awesome books as well.  The theme of the class was where one draws the line between the human and inhuman.

His classes are fascinating--they go all over the place, and you come away with something new every time. Ditto the other comments about his feedback. It's helpful and he is a fair grader.

We didn't cover all of the poems he assigned us, but the tangential discussions were quite memorable. After each essay assignment, I improved more and more because Professor Willner makes very specific and helpful comments on the papers- better grader than any professor I've seen at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2009<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very stimulating discussions, hated the books but loved the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: EN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Poetry was not my thing, but he made the calss very interesting.

He can be a lil unorthodox(He likes to &quot;bark&quot; at ideas), and sometimes vague. Just ask questions or email him and youll be fine. This was an easy going class but he didnt let us out early (it was a night class so we only met once a week).  I would highly recomend him if you are upbeat and will work a lil bit</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy just ask if you need help!
