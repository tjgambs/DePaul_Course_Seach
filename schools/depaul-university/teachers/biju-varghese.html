	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

She helps students after class and she also post lecture notes online.  You must buy the book and be prepared for homework.  Do the homework and study you should get at least a B.

If you hate math take her, not only was the class easy, but I actually learned. She made calculus easy with her review guides and she posts all of her class notes! I'd probably take another math class as an elective just to be taught by her again, and she's a nice person don't be afraid to ask her for help!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>She truly wants her students to succeed.

The tests are pretty easy if you pay attention in class. She always has an extra credit problem at the end of each test.

Also makes herself easily available for office hours and her tests are very straight forward,  and never significantly harder than anything discussed in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is amazing! She will not move on until absolutely everyone in class understands what she's going over. She is very fair and always offers help to anyone that is struggling. If you have the chance take her, so great that I'm writing this review before the class is even over! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2014<br>Class Name: CALC136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing! There are no words up there to describe how wonderful and helpful she is. She is one of those teachersthat you will remember to the rest of your life. Highly recommend. Math with her is a piece of cake. She is THE BEST .if you have any problem just talk to her. Love her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best math teacher ever! Unfortunately she doesn't teach 137. Take her if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's good take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very passionate and caring professor, something you don't find often. She genuinely wants everyone to ace her class and takes time to help everyone get there. She will require effort from you but that is necessary if you wish to learn math. I strongly suggest her over another math teacher, she is also grades based on participation</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Varghese was honestly the greatest math teacher ever! Although her accent can be hard to understand she does her best and you get used to it. She is extremely helpful, tests are straight forward, and she gives you reviews before every test. Going from a poor MAT 135 teacher to her was amazing! I wish she tought 137!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Varghese is an AMAZING math teacher! She explains everything very clearly and is very friendly! The tests are exactly the material that she covers in class! No surprises! She sometimes also gives some extra credit problems at the end of the tests. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend her! Hands down the best Math Professor at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend her to anyone. She went over the material slowly so it was easy to keep up. Her midterm and final are exactly like the review packets she posts, so if you look over them enough you're guaranteed an A. She always gives a couple extra credit  questions on tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly strict and don't expect to get out of class the slightest bit early or on time for that matter. She uses every minute and her accent is pretty hard to understand. For tests she doesn't give a review packet she just works out the homework, stay away if you prefer test/exam review sheets. Overall I would stay away from her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Just keep up with the homework and you shouldn't get lower than a B. She offers a lot of extra help and is very straightforward.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very helpful and clear with each and every step you take with each problem. However you must attend class and especially DO THE HOMEWORK if you want to succeed in this class. She can be a bit slow and tedious at times, but she's a great teacher for it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is willing to help you because she really does want to make sure that alll of her students learn the material, but she also likes to have 15 minute long speeches about not interrupting her class. If you know nothing about calc, take her class because you will for sure learn, but if you like math, you might get bored.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an AMAZING teacher. I failed this class twice before taking it with her and I have never more clearly understood Calculus II.. Her tests are just like the homework. And the homework is mandatory. So, do the homework and review it before the quizzes. No surprises on the midterm or final. She's strict, but she is awesome! Highly recommend!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>you cant get better than her. If you are looking for a calc 1 or calc 2 teacher, take her! Super nice, super easy. It is math so you are going to need to do work but i cant see how you'll find a better calc professor than her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is math so one has to work hard and do the work assigned. But  ever did she assign overwhelming amounts. She is great and caring for every student. You put in the work and it will pay off. She is the best math professor I have ever had. She is the best and a must take!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had a pretty bad teacher for 135 and was worried I wouldn't be prepared for 136 and I was wrong! Varghese is a wonderful teacher who honestly wants you to succeed. Ask her questions if you're confused, she wants to help! Even though it's an 8:30am class, it's worth it. Just don't talk during her lecture, she takes that very seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Varghese was a good teacher. She answered all the questions and really cared. No surprises on the tests, it was all covered in class. If you paid attention in class and did your homework you barely need to study because youll get at least a B. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2012<br>Class Name: M135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great teacher and i struggle with math. Her grade scale works in your favor, ex: and 60 percent is a c-.  If you dont pass the class you kinda deserve not to.  She is strict and will call you out if your acting a little rude.  Calc isnt easy but she makes it easier.  The class is 2 tests (40%), hw plus attendence(20%) final plus mid term (40%).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I struggle with math, a lot. Professor Varghese is a wonderful teacher. Her tests are not meant to trick her students. If you do the homework, the tests are based right from it. She stresses a lot about doing the hw as a test, and if you do study that way, you definitely will pass! I'm taking Varghese for 136 and I'm not nervous whatsoever.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2012<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best math teacher I have ever had, ever.  She is so helpful and wants students to really learn the material.  I dreaded taking both business calculus classes and after taking one with her, it was a BREEZE.  the material is hard, but she is the BEST professor to teach it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very strict but a GREAT professor!  If your going to goof around she will yell at you, but she is the best math professor I have had at depaul! She explains everything so great and makes sure you understand.  I definitely recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2012<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a good math teacher. Very helpful, and she genuinely cares about students receiving good grades. She has an accent, but it's not unbearable. There are many other math professors at DePaul with worse accents and she is much better than most. Don't slack off, pay attention, ask for help if need be, and you will do great.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best math teacher I have ever had! Go in to see her, she loves to help and will love that you are trying in her class. I am awful at math and got an A in the class. Take her, she's great!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2011<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Varghese makes this class easy. She knows what she's talking about and can also teach it. If you're taking this class with a friend, don't. She is very strict about talking. Attendance and homework are mandatory. Doing the homework helps! Her tests are easy. She wants to help you. The grade you get on any assignment is the grade you deserve.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2011<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class isnt as easy as everyone claims. Her tests are all pretty hard, including the midterm.

Homework grades should be easy 100s but the tests were pretty hard, even if you study. I think she might have curved at the end, but still not an easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Varghese is a great teacher! She really cares about her students. Tests were not hard at all and she gives the answers to all the homework problems before the test so you can make sure you understand them.

I highly recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the best math instructor I have had at DePaul.  She is very open to class questions and posts helpful notes online.  She assigns homework after every class, but they do not take much time.  She gives 4 chapter tests, a midterm and a final.  Study for the exams, follow her notes and you'll do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2010<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor.

Even if you ace the hw which is worth points if u bomb the final and midterm ur grade is screwed. Only thing I didn't like was her tests were only 25 questions but she make a study guide of 80 different kinds of problems from each section so u  don't know what's on the test. too broad</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her accent is not bad at all. She goes through problems repetitively which sounds bad, but it helps so much, and it also helps that her quizzes and tests are nearly the same as the problems she does in class, step-by-step. Let me repeat, step-by-step.If you could tolerate this review, you will tolerate her.

Although her accent is a little hard to understand once in a while, she knows how to teach. She does example after example (which can sometimes be tedious), but it's very helpful for students who struggled in the class. Her tests are also based on her study guides, which are based on the homework. I recommend this professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Birju is by far the best Math Prof. at DePaul. It's not that she cares what people think of her its just that she shows that she genuinely cares. She says that if you try your best and work hard she will go out of her way to help you succeed. Do take her and you'll be glad that you did. She gives you all the tools you need to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2007<br>Class Name: BMS156<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Varghese did a great job in teaching 4 chapters of material in only 10 weeks.

She did everything in her power to make it easy for us. I have no idea how there were individuals who were still failing her class.
