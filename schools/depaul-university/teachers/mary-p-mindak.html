Now, it is totally up to you to do the problems she assigns! If you know how to do every little problem we went over in class, every problem she assigned and every problem on midterm review- you WILL score well on tests. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2015<br>Class Name: 304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>Had her for 304 and went in skeptical due to her low ratings here. Was shocked by how well she taught and kept us engaged. Class is tough, must keep up with readings and be prepared for tests. One of the best professors I've had</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor.  She wants all of her students to do well and she really wants you to understand the material. She offers several extra credit opportunities.  There are three homework assignments and one fairly easy project.  Her lectures and lecture notes are very helpful.  I would definitely take her again.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mindak is a great professor, don't bother with the bad reviews. She is not going to give you an easy A, but gives you all the resources necessary to earn it. If you ever need help she is always there to answer your questions. She gives extra credit for tests and final is curved. Averages for all were high 70s. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>People need to understand that this is considered a weed-out class for accounting majors, so no!, it is not a walk in the park. Howeve Mindak is willing to help as much as YOU want her to help you. She always responded to my emails, sometimes within minutes of sending one (even on the weekends). Just pay attention in class and do the class problems</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2014<br>Class Name: 304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know why she has such a low grade. Prof Mindak is amazing! She literally makes time in her schedule to meet with you, in person or via electronically if you need help. Very approachable. Willing to help you understand. The material is a lot but if you study and ask for help, you can do fine. She has real world experience. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2014<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Total of 3 tests-- each consisting of 34 chapters. No curves given on exams however she gives you extra credit. There is homework (not much--very reasonable). The book is not necessary unless you want to do the extra problems she assigns. She's not as experienced as a professor as I would have liked her to be. Has Skype hours and phone hrs.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2013<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible! Teaches from Powerpoint slides & Rushes over easy problems in class & then on test she side-blinds you with an elaborate version you never covered! Tests are 80% multi choice and doesn't give partial credit for showing wrk Instead of adding points to the grades when class fails, she assigns hard extra credit that takes hours to complete.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2013<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i dislike her teaching way</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid at all costs! First of all she's young and inexperienced in the real accounting world. Yea she knows the book but she hardly has any accounting professional experience. She gets off topic then tries to rush through the material. If you think you know what's going on in class and in your homework think again when it come down to test time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2013<br>Class Name: ACC397<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof was knowledge and told some good stories. The test and quizzes given was a good reflection of the material. However, it was hard to study since Audit 2 is very subjective. I was doing very well until the final based on studying the notes and the practice quizzes. THe final is worth so much more than anything else. Study hard for it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2013<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a tough class but the prof. makes it worthwhile. She has a lot of experience. It is advanced material, so I think others are complaining a lot. I learned a lot from the projects we did and by following the answers that we went over after each test. They explain everything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Instructors should not comment on their own sites. Good luck to all of those that will be taking her.. you will see. This class will become your new nightmare. Tough tough grader!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her tests are designed to encourage creative thinking. If you really know the material, instead of just memorizing it, you will do well. It is not impossible to get an A in this class even without a curve. Just make sure you do read the book. She is also very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When questions were asked in class, she would either say: &quot;I don't know&quot; or &quot;I can't answer that.&quot; She would promise to follow up on material and then did not. The material stressed in class was not equaly balanced with tests. We spent a wk on debt and zero test questions - 7 slides/one day on IT - IT covered several essay & multi &#63;'s Terrible prof</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>10 wkly papers ? 20 min presentation w/ 10 pg paper sgl spaced ? 2 quizzes ? mid ? final. Know the audit ?8? step plan: the audit procedures and internal control for EACH step. The hmwk will not help, but the online ppt?s and tests will. Mrks correct answers wrong even when its from the book. I wouldn't wish this teacher on my worst enemy GL.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a highly inexperienced teacher (which she admits) and should be at a community college until she can effectively communicate material.  Stroble students and 4.0 students failed last quarter due to her grading and testing style. This means highly intelligent hard working students are being effected by DePaul's hiring mistake.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's a very good teacher. very caring and helpful. if you work hard you will get an A or B. So much easier than auditing 1, but still very interesting and I learned a lot. Stop your belly aching people. It's college.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>USELESS -- midterm and final had material that was not in the book or reviewed in class. Focused the students attention on cases rather than CPA audit material. 60% of the final was on material taught the week before the test. Acct'ing is my world, this prof. made me HATE it for the first time! Please, to save your GPA take another prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a good person but an absolutely awful professor. I am very passionate about accounting and audit, but she made me hate it for 10 weeks. She expects too much from her students in 10 weeks. Ppts are word-for-word from the book. Her grading is very subjective and she treats her class like they are all 5-year olds.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stingy grader even when she does not know what kind of answer she is looking for. Her favorite response when you ask her a question: &quot;I can't answer that.&quot; Avoid at all costs!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT374<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY TOUGH GRADER!!! No Curves really, gave extra credit to make up! Had Guest Speaker in class, which was helpful! Please explain your grading scale so students understand how to do well in your class. Needs to Offer help to students without taking into account other students if they come personally without constantly thinking about class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice lady and she does want students to learn. However, her exams--especially the final we took today--are brutal. She tested us on some things she did not even cover in class. Yes this is a high level accounting class, but I had not run into any other high level accounting classes this challenging (this is my last quarter)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of whiners about this class--it is an upper level accounting class--exams are challenging but she gives numerous opportunities to increase your percentage--very nice and genuinely interested in her students' comprehension</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Written assignments on cases are not bad at all. I just think she puts too much weight on the presentation (50% of the group project grade). This is not a public speaking class and she should have focused more on the overall content instead. She does give difficult exams and grade hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't go so far as these other comments but definitely try to take someone else if you can. She's very nice but her classes are very boring and useless. You must teach yourself the material. I took Shelton for 372 and thought I'd never miss her but I actually do, at least she was an easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID -- The worst teacher DePaul has to offer! 9 shrt papers (will take ur hrs and impossible to get an A)- 1 5pg paper single spaced with a 20min presentation - 2 take hm quizzes - midterm - final. The class would not be bad if she taught the material, but she just give us the publisher ppt's. She should be FIRED!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div></div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2010<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard.....Hard grader....</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
