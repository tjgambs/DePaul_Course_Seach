Nice guy, if your moderate to republican the class might not rub you the right way but... he's tolerable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2006<br>Class Name: CMN346342<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best advice: DO THE READINGS!!! His quizzes require details so at least know enough to look like you tried. He appreciates students who participate and is a very kind professor...most exams are take-home and effort equals easy A :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: CMN342<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is kinda interesting but there is a lot of reading and pop quizzes!  he tends to stutter and pace back and forth too, but if you do your work its an easy A but its alota work</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: CMN342<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked his class.  I dont understand all the boring comments because he realy had a lot of interesting stuff to say and brought in a lot of greta media elements.  He grades pretty easily and is lax about missing class.  Also, he has his masters from NYU's renowned Tisch Film School.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2005<br>Class Name: CMN342<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such a nice and friendly teacher...his class is interesting too.  He is not boring, nor is the class...it is very interesting and you learn a lot of media-related things you probably would never had known.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2005<br>Class Name: CMN271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy and the class isn't hard</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: CMN342<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>MOST BORING TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!  If you have ever dreaded going to a class you will dread going to this one...on the other hand he grades very easy...so if your looking to bring up you GPA-take the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: CMN271<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not a bad teacher nor is he that boring. If you pay attention and participate, you'll enjoy it. He's nice and helpful, and not a very hard grader. Plus, he shows a lot of movies. I'd take his class again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: CMN271<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class makes me want to stab myself in the eyes with a rusty nail.  DO NOT TAKE CLASS FROM HIM. Being the most boring class I've ever taken, it is such a waste of time and money. It could be a lot of fun, but he doesn't even try to make it exciting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2004<br>Class Name: CMN342<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the most boring teacher I have had at DePaul and i had him twice in one day.  One positive thing is we watch a lot of clips so that's pretty cool, but otherwise I was bored.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
