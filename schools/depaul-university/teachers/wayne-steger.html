			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

He's extremely knowledgable on an impressive number of subjects, yet he is easily approachable and very understanding with his students. Perhaps a bit unorganized - but so long as you read the material, speak your mind and put some effort into your papers, expect a good grade!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2009<br>Class Name: PSC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of, if not the best professor I had in college.  Cared about me more than any other professor, saved my butt more than once.  The claim that you need to take the left wing position is nonsense, I am a conservative Republican and spoke my mind.  He is VERY intelligent, and sees through BS like water, so you have to think and apply yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I worked my butt off for this class and I got a C--my first C in college. He messed up my GPA. His grading is impossible and it is true...he only likes extremely left wing democrats. He picks and chooses students as his favorites. Class discussion isn't required but he makes everyone feel tense. Don't take him for political science. Enough said.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Steger is an incredible professor.  He is the reason I declared my major to political science.  In order to do well, engaging in discussions is critical and reading the text.  The multiple choice and final on his midterms came straight from the text but the essays came from class discussions.  Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2007<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor!!!  He is really helpful with his and other classes.  If you need anything you can go to his office and he is more than willing to help.  I would tell anyone to take his class, if you don't you are missing one of depaul's best.  He is not a really easy grader, but if you go to the lectures and read just a little, you will do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class and professor are Awesome!

He's a straight up politics junkie and is incredibly knowledgable and engrossing. I had him for Congress. He could be a little pompous sometimes, but he knows enough to get away with it.

Expect to make inferences and not only memorize, but try to go a step further. Make sure to participate in class now and then. Otherwise, the lectures are really interesting, but he talks a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great professor and very knowledgable. He encourages class participation and sometimes randomly calls on people. The tests are not at all easy. His multiple choice is very complex. The class isn't an easy A.

I'm not a political junkie and I got a really good grade.  If you go to class and listen to the lecture and take notes you'll be fine.  I never read unless I had to.
