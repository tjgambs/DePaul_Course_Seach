Best prof I've had. I loved this class and can't wait to take another with her. She is very inspiring and adorable. She loves students who show interest (not too hard with her) and she is eccentric! She made the class a breeze. One word she uses a lot: Lovely, describes her perfectly</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: CREATIVEWRITING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my &quot;dead poets society&quot; professors.

Occasionally a tough grader, but it's worth it in the end when you see how much you've improved. You'll need to keep in mind that the class is only as great as it's worst student.
