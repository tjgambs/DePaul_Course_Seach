	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

I wrote an essay on a topic he was skeptical about but he loved it because I wrote it successfully. He is not your HS teacher who loves when you use fluff and BS. I strongly suggest taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Some say that he is rude or disrespectful, and he may be sometimes. But he motivates you to use FACTS and INFORMATION and the class was very interesting. The negative comments most likely came from people that handed in papers with little to no logic/facts. Use logic/facts and don't be dumb. He's witty and funny and would probably win at jeopardy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he was horrible. barely taught anything just about different fallacies. never really helped out on papers, just told you that you were wrong, and would probably tell you to start from scratch. too sarcastic. pretty rude comments on papers. don't take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is pretty easy. Yea he is sarcastic, but it is not that bad. There are about four papers and they are very easy to write. They are peer reviewed and then he collects them and gives them back with exactly what to change. If you correct what he told you to you will get a good grade. Do NOT be late to turn in the final paper. I almost faile</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: WORD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes he is sarcastic and no you can't disagree with him or you will be made fun of.  The class itself is pretty simple if you take the time to think and actually spend time on the papers.  Once you realize the style he likes it's easy to get a good grade in the class.  Oh and he's anything but hot, sorry.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2009<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE HIM!

He is really awkward, but it shows he's human. He knows his stuff and is always willing to help you even after class. If you really want to learn to write well, I would highly recommend him.

The only people that complained about him in class were incompetent writers who were lazy and barely showed up to class or were just highly sensitive. If you care about writing, he is an excellent teacher to have. His critiques are challenging, tough and extremely helpful. Plus, he is very attractive.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>103 and 104 were the exact same syllabuses. he gives 4 papers (three pages each), and grades you pretty fairly.  then it's just a portfolio at the end of the quarter that you submit 3/4 papers, and you can make all the corrections on them that he made on his initial grading.  overall really easy, kind of funny, + worth taking over another professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he really embarassed me one time in class... he shuts down comments and made fun of me once for something about one of my papers. hes very sarcastic. i was so worried about being picked on in class i was never excited to come to his class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny as hell, laid back and cool, gives fun assignments, not hard to get through the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2007<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>will kind of seem like a jerk, but is really a good teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is great. I really didn't think an english class could be interesting but he makes you think about stuff in a totally different way.

I'll be honest, he comes off as mean and intimidating but hes a good teacher. hes tough and VERY sarcastic but you'll learn a lot</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he was very helpful when i went to ask for some help on my papers. but he is such a hard grader for a basic english class! most of his classes were interesting but he thinks he is the smartest man in the world and not afraid to say it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2006<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had this professor last fall, and consider him to be one of the best teachers I've had at Depaul.  It's unfortunate most of his ratings are so negative, but it's probably because most of his students are freshmen that are used to having their hands held during the whole writing process.  He has an awesome sense of humor, too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Who ever wrote down there before only liked him because u think he is &quot;hot&quot; FYI he isn’t. Terrible teach not clear and on a “I hate the world” tangent about everything. Always thinks he is right when he isn’t. If you want vagueness take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was not clear about what we were supposed to write about.  A fourth of the class failed and I heard that in another class half the class failed until he curved the grades.  Try to stay away from him for your own sake.  You need to be almost an english professor yourself to pass this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class seemed cool, until the grades came back</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, people who give him a bad rating are just the students who were complete morons and didn't know how to write.  It's not the professor's fault that a bunch of freshman who came into his class didn't know there were other punctuation marks besides commas and periods.  Awesome professor with a great sense of humor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: ENGLISH102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very vague with what he wants with you for papers.

Very strict on grammar though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: ENG108<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>warning!!!, horrible teacher, hypocritical and grades strictly. He talks on and on and never gets to go over the readings that we are suppose to go over. Tells us last minute how essays should be done.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated his class.  He never tells you what he really wants from a paper.  He is very picky with everything especially grammar.  I hate this class.  It is really hard.  Good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE IS A GOOD TEACHER OVERALL. HE GRADES BASED ON HOW WELL YOU CAN EXPRESS YOURSELF AND IN THE ORIGINALITY OF YOUR IDEAS AND HOW WELL YOU CAN SUSTAIN THEM. INTERESTING CLASS OVERALL. THE HARDEST PART IS THAT HE MAKES YOU CHOOSE A QUESTION TO ANSWER BASED ON A TOPIC.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have to say, from the moment I met Chris I respected him.  He's a great guy... sometimes he takes everything a little too technical, but that's just because he knows too much for how young he is.  I would honestly say that if you were to take this class, you'd become smarter. About 3 quizzes; essays every week, but they're not too hard. Be honest</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a pretty fair teacher and knows what he's looking for. This could help you and hurt you. He likes papers very simple and getting straight to the point so if you write you papers like that you're set.  Plus, you don't really have to do the readings, just show up.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is pretty easy. If you just read the paper assignments and do what he asks, the class is easy. If you have questions, just talk to  him. If you talk to him about assignments, he seems to grade you easier. Don't bother doing the readings. Go to class though, then you get an A for participation.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's pretty easy for the most part.  He likes people who's writing style is more personal than professional.  That made this class easy for me.  Some say he's cute...but he's liek the nerdy cute.  Also, class is boring, but you never need to read anything.  Just pretend you did.  Show up for class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>professor is good. he is pretty funny and has a young outlook on life and teaching. i was never bored in his class. readings were sometimes boring but class wasnt. papers are a little hard to figure out. but he is nice on grading if u try. and are not late. going to class helps too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't do any tests but he does assign a lot of papers.

Pretty critical, although in a trying-to-be-helpful way, and his students tend to not care/participate in discussion for some reason.  Extremely unclear in assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely thinks he is the smartest, most interesting person ever to grace the face of the earth.
