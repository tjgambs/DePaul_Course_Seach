He made the class as fun as he could. It had lots of reading and writing involved but all of it was very informal or was not mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2013<br>Class Name: PPS200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of lecturing. Attend class and do most of the reading and you'll be find. A bit boring at times and he often gets off on tangents while talking but that's only because he wants you to know every possible fact about the material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2013<br>Class Name: PPS200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>I may be grading this harshly based on the fact this is an intro class. However, as a speaker he ran off on tangents way too often, and the material learned in this class is incredibly redundant and boring if you already have any basic knowledge of civics. If you were previously an APGAP student or such, stay away unless you really need the easy A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was nice and helpful and the class was easy, but man, is he terrible at housekeeping. He takes forever to give a paper back and is forgetful. Class isn't fun, no one talks, and I didn't learn anything new in this multicultural seminar. Thought it was a waste of time, but prof was nice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great instructor, he is very clear although train of though sometimes slips. He is very understanding when it come to assignment completion.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2013<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Discover Chicago Urban Agriculture. Immersion Week was actually pretty fun and more interesting than expected. The essays and papers could be tough and stressful at times but were still manageable. All in all, a pretty good first year class, even since it was the last choice left.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2011<br>Class Name: PPS200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decent for an intro class. Too much weight on assignments because there was only a few. Also, pretty redundant if that annoys you; fell asleep once or twice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2010<br>Class Name: PPS329<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously guys, this world still have nice people like prof. Bartling. He is nice, helpful, and passionate about the subject. Take him, attend classes, and do your work and you will get an A. He is an easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2009<br>Class Name: PPS201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor! He is funny and makes the class worth the time.

LOTS OF WORK TO DO.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Explore:Chicago and Its Suburbs with Hugh. Possibly the most boring class especially at 8:30. He's a pretty easy grader but this class is really hard to motivate yourself to go to.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whatever you do, do not take Explore Chicago: Chicago and it's suburbs.  Possibly the most boring class ever.  However, Professor Bartling is extremely nice and is a good teacher.  He knows what he is talking about.  He can be a bit akward, random referances to drinking in high school and attempts at jokes. Responds to emails quickly and is on AIM.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2007<br>Class Name: PPS302<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's nice, but TERRIBLY BORING and a bit awkward. It was a chore to go to class, and going was pointless. He 'discussed' the readings every day. Just read a few pages of the books so you can write the papers. Papers for midterm & final, one research paper- EASY GRADER! Went on 2 'field trips' to meetings/conferences which were pretty cool.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are extremely boring. Participation is an important part of the class so try to talk a lot.  Other than that he is a fairly easy grader on the midterm and final papers.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had this prof for the Freshman explore class on urban planning. The subject matter was interesting, and Bartling undoubtedly knows a lot about it, but he wasn't an engaging speaker. The class was three hours long and a little boring. But he's an easy grader and pretty funny (sometimes).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2006<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For a 300-level course, this prof. was very easy.  He's very boring, goes off on tangents all the time, and is an absolutely horrible speaker.  I was very disappointed with the prof., but I enjoyed the reading material.  Take him only if you want an easy A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2006<br>Class Name: PPS330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knowledgeable and funny.  Take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2006<br>Class Name: HON204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible class!!! He talked the entire period, even when we had student presentations. He rambled on and would tell jokes, stop in the middle to remember, then finish telling it. He is a horrible speaker. The midterm, final, and class projects were very long and thrown on at the same time. Easy grader, I didn't buy a single book but still got an A-</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: HON204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>talks FOREVER. REALLY easy grader, but the classes are torture.  loves to hear himself talk, but does know a lot about his subject.  scatterbrained, but if you like the class it could be interesting.  if you are passive about the class and want to be engaged, take a different prof.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a very boring class, but very easy. You watch the movies outside of class each week and write a 2 page paper on it. He is an easy grader, but the lectures are very long and boring and will almost go the whole time. Participation is 20% of your grade. Easy class though!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2005<br>Class Name: LDR380SOC390<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good guy. Helpful. Very intelligent. A lot of readings. Talks a lot, tends to ramble, so make sure its not a 3 hour class.

Lots of outside classwork, lots of movies and readings. Fairly easy grader if you do the reading and watch the films assigned outside of class. Lectures dragged, but overall a good class to take.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Guy, he does assign alot of readings, films, and papers, but his grading is very straight forward and easy.  As long as you make sense when you write your papers its an A.  Avoid 3 hr lectures b/c he likes to talk alot, and it becomes boring.  FYI, You dont watch movies during class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: PPS330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hugh tends to talk a lot but the material was interesting. The class was really not hard for the 300 level. He is very easy to talk to and encourages class participation. The papers were not hard, and he was an understanding grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him only if it's a short class because he does talk a lot.
