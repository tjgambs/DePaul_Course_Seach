			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

Do the reading. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2015<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The first couple of weeks of this class is frustrating and intimidating. Once you actually get what she is looking for and understand the class, it'll be a least a month in. After that its a lot of weekly assignments, weekly labs, and participation. You'll definitely use the book for this class, its essential! Work hard, and you'll get an A or B  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>By the time you realize what she really wants you've dropped a letter grade. Assignment rubrics are unclear and she assumes you know what she wants. She doesn't really teach. Forces participation. No electronics in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>If I wrote this at the beginning of the course, my rating would have been lower because I was always a little confused. As the course went on, what she expected became more clear. She's a passionate teacher who cares about you having a system to evaluate ethical dilemmas in real life. I think I'll always have Kant and RuleAct util. in my head now.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>The ethical frameworks were barely taught to us. We were expected to learn them all from a handout and example. We did not know what was expected and got docked points for our assignments for doing it wrong when she did not really teach us how to. All the assignments were repetitive. She seems lazy to teach and very unorganized </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2014<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a decent teacher teaching a dry subject. Evelyn knows her subject, and does her best to foster interest in her students. She is a reasonable grader, and tends to be down to earth about class expectations. Not a bad choice if you need to knock out your ethics classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't really know why everyone is complaining about her. I don't care about technology, ethics, or what the course is about, but I got an A on all my assignments. The labs are easy A's, just copy paste from text book and cite. She was super nice to me, and quickly responded to emails. I didn't participate and still got an A. It's not hard.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lulis is just okay, she definitley seems very very open and respectful to students needs and what they want in a class. She always asks opinions and has you take a survey in the beginning of the course about what you expect out of a class/teacher. The class seems repetitive however and the labs are tedious. Grading is strange. No midterm.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take her for LSP121.  She seems nice enough but is confusing.  She takes stupid points off on assignments and doesn't know how to explain the material.  Two people actually got in a shouting matching in our class because they were so frustrated...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2013<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is god awful, I did not learn a thing and she is not helpful at all. You do stupid labs every week where everyone basically fails because she is so strict yet does not tell you what she expects on them. Avoid her at all costs!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's quite awful at teaching the material, I haven't learned a single thing. Hard to pay attention because I never know what she's talking about. Makes the class a lot harder in that way. Take a different professor for this class!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2011<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was an OK professor, she definitely wants you to learn the material but really wasn't available for office hours and her response to email questions always came days later. Class was interesting and I enjoyed it but she definitely didn't prepare you for the midterms and finals.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mostly an easy class, but didn't like her. Takes points off for stupid things, contradicts herself, and hires crappy graders to grade other stuff who suck as well, taking off points for very dumb reasons, then she supports their decisions to do so.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2010<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>enjoyed class and lectures.

Couldn't disagree more with 2 evals below. She is kind,  respectful and open minded. She plays devil's advocate, but I never heard her express her own opinion. she challenges you. I struggled in the class, but she spent hours outside office hours helping me. I took another ethics class and didn't even cover the philopshy like she did.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2010<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While the class is an easy A, Professor Lulis does little to aid her students in attaining any kind of knowledge from her class. While she clearly is extremely intelligent, she lacks open-mindedness and teaching skills. Even though I got an A, I regret wasting my money on this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE THIS CLASS!! it was interesting and the teacher was very respectful and helpful. It  helps to go to class, but u don't have to. she teaches how to think not what to think. Can be a hard grader, but it pays off in the end. Also, I am a better writer becasue of this class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had a great experience! She is so nice -- the nicest teacher I have had at DePaul. Problem must be with the writing tutors -- I do not think she uses them anymore -- we did not. Interesting class. Hard grader for the papers, but made me learn the material for the final. If you go to class, you can do well. Very intersting class activities.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I completely disagree with the posts below! The class was interesting and fun. She was always excited about the material. I hardly miss class and understood the material completely. She was very helpfull and alway there to answer questions. VERY fair grader. If you come to class and do the reading you can get a decent grade. She made me think.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I completely agree with the two postings below, this teacher is absolutely terrible. She is extremely incomprehensible, as well as an unfair grader. She is lazy, she approaches class as if it is a chore, and shows no interest what so ever. She would hardly qualify as community college material.

She makes us go to the writing center, who says a paper is well done, but she disagrees and will not budge. Grades based off of grammer and how well you write overall instead of content.
