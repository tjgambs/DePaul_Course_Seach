She didn't know what she want nor did the students. Useless activities in class (I struggled to be awake). The exams are brutal and it was all from the book (attending class was useless). You need to memorize half the book and understand everything(even authors names). Avoid her if you can .</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: MGT340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was great! Yeah you need to read a good amount, but most of the reading was fun. Included two group presentations which were a lot of fun. I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2013<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is beyond helpless. I felt as though this course was entirely driven by external "assessments" where you take a personality test and read the results and write a paper about the results. The professor could not keep the class in line, in a graduate program! Provided no help or direction when asked basic questions about her assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2011<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a nice lady! Interesting class and not too hard. Toughest part is writing about your own leadership style and how to improve. Good book but can get by w/o reading it much. Cases & exercises are more important than the text book.She grades fairly exactly according to evaluation guidelines. She really seems to care about her students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2011<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this as an elective and really enjoyed it. I personally think this class should be mandatory for all MBAs as &quot;Leadership in Orgs&quot; is fundamental to an MBA experience. The class is interactive and very informative. The professor keeps the information relevant and engaging. Guest speakers really add value. MBAs, take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2010<br>Class Name: MGT535<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst DePaul course ever!Waste of time/money!Prof was not engaging, boring lectures! (not to mention short! lots of busy class discussions to fill up class time?) Didn't bring any interesting/appealing personal experience to class. Never intelligently answered class questions! Gave the impression she lacked both teaching & working experience...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very kind professor. She is very interested in having students interact and share knowledge. Easy to talk to in and outside of class. Very respectful and fairly graded. I recommend her any day. Class is never boring with her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2010<br>Class Name: MGMT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>M.Posig did't teach at all.  Class was structured so that all presentations were done by students. Too much reading material, papers, case studies, presentations and exams for 5-week class.  She seems very knowledgeable of the field but didnt share much.  Not helpful outside of class either.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2010<br>Class Name: MGTMGT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unfortunately, this has been the first bad professor I have had at DePaul.  Unfortunately, she does not teach you anything during the class ....... not a good use of our time, money, and intellect.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2010<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Posig is a good professor and you should take her if you have an interest in the subject. The work is pretty average and she grades more than fairly. She clearly has a passion for the material (leadership)- but is clearly academically focused. I think someone with more corporate leadership experience would be better suited to teach this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2009<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Posig really takes an interest in her students - I took this in the summer, and we could only miss one class. Show up, do the work, and you'll be set! Midterm and final papers take some time, but aren't hard. Very easy grader for papers as well, as long as you follow the outline! Besides papers, very little work outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2009<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is interesting and useful.  Learn a lot by in class activities and readings.  Midterm paper not bad, but final 15 page paper takes some time.  You get an A if you do the work</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2009<br>Class Name: MGT535<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perfectly nice lady, but I would've learned just as much stairing at a blank wall for 3hrs and 15mins.  Her practical knowledge is out the window. On a good note, I leisurly read a book for my own entertainment during her class. Plus, she doesn't assign the group paper for the summer class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2008<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A (1,000 pts in class), but a lot of work to do final paper & group presentation in end; especially if you have another demanding class.  Repeat of concepts you learned in management.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2008<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is very good.  Prof Posig cares about her students and their learning.  Information presented in class is useful for managers/leaders.  She brings in movie clips from different sources to supplement her teaching.  Homework is not overwhelming.  Group project is req'd.  No tests.  Written midterm & final papers.  Would take her class again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2008<br>Class Name: MGT535<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OK class. Not too exciting, though it is my concentration. Expected more.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2008<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is a complete waste of time. Easy A but you learn very little. Paper sounds chalanging but really isnt</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2008<br>Class Name: MGT535<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Less useful and informational than her leadership MGT530 class.  Only becomes meaningful at the very end of the semester with conclusion of group project.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2008<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy and interesting class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2008<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Posig is a good professor that presents a lot of interesting and useful material.  The only weakness is there is too much weekly material so you don't get to spend a lot of time on items.  I recommend doing the case study (midterm) early in the term to allow more time for the group project and final paper.  Do the work and you should get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2008<br>Class Name: MGT535<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very dull and boring class.  Material is very academic in nature.  Case studies are useful and interesting, but that is about it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2008<br>Class Name: MGMT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher with lots of information</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2007<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class.

Will keep you in class until 9:14.

Lots of movies. Good discussion. Laid back about missing class, coming late, etc. Final written paper instead of exam. Pretty lenient on grading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2003<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty good professor that used a lot of class discussion and getting into groups to discuss cases that passed the time quickly and moved class along nicely.  Only real homework was a 5 page mid-term and a 20 page (max) final paper.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
