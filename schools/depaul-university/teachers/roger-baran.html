Quizzes were 25 questions to be answered in 20 minutes and almost always ran out of time.  Midterm and final were worth 40 percent with only 8 short essay questions on each. Professor was knowledgeable and taught from real world experience, more so than the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>you have to read the book often because his lectures are unclear. the main project is designing a survey and it was an A. he was kind of forgetful and his lectures were done from a single massive powerpoint.  the exams used too many short answer questions that took forever. besides business calc these were the hardest exams I  had. took 2013</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>The homework was tough, and when he tried to show us in class, he did it wrong the first 2 times.  He graded pretty easily on that, though. His test was all essay format--for marketing research! It was ridiculous. I enjoyed his lectures but his exams need to change!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>Older guy, not so present or helpful. Doesn't seem to care, doesn't like DePaul. Lectures are beyond boring. No class interaction. Graded on just midterm and final. Study the lecture slides and books! The 15 essay questions were fair, the 80 or so multiple choice questions were not! No idea what they were on. Needs extreme updating. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned to use SPSS more effectively and compose survey professionally. Answer all review questions in the book; TAKE NOTES in class, get basic SPSS knowledge, then an A isn't hard. Yes, his HW instructions are not as organized as 'How to drive a tank manual', but again graduate level students should be smart enough to figure it out.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>His class materials are pretty unorganized. SPSS knowledge isn't mandatory, but all of the homework was in SPSS. When he showed us in class how to do it on our own, it took him 3-4 tries to get it right...which was incredibly confusing. Didn't respond to emails. He is clearly a very smart man, but not a good teacher at all.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>strong recommend! He's a very good professor, and his assignments would force you to study very hard! a lot of review questions were covered in the midterm and final exam!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2011<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is painfully boring.  He uses a lot of slides and expects you to print them (don't do it).  Everything he said would be on the test wasn't...so study everything.  He did curve our midterm like crazy.  I failed the midterm and got an A. He tries to help you!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2011<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Notes are unorganized and difficult to read. All class topics are tested on the teo exams using essay style.  Write down everything he says and memorize it! the exam also includes 25 pages of chpt Q's that require straight memorization but only consist of 6 questions of the test.  He gives poor guidance on the project with 20% of your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>murderously difficult but worthy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2011<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is LAZY.  He has been using the same notes & test q's for &gt;10 years.  He is old, and prepares half the midterm & final q's verbatim from q's at the end of every textbook chapter. Students are expected to memorize over 25pg of q's on his ESSAY tests. Expects u to know the entire textbook when he actually teaches only ~25% from it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2011<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Baran is a great professor.  His course isn't an easy A, but all the information from his lecture notes relates back to the book.  He always responds to questions via email and has a ton of experience and knowledge in the subject.  He's teaching another class in Spring that I will likely register for.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2010<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class through Blackboard.  Book was $100 and found out at the end that there was no point buying it since the final was entirely on watching his online lectures and taking notes.  These lectures were incredibly boring and the case studies asked questions about things that weren't even covered in lecture or the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2010<br>Class Name: MKT535<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Our class was required to do a case analysis every week, which was very time consuming, but I got a lot out of it.  He is a very interesting prof, I would take another one of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2010<br>Class Name: MRKT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Baran is a great.  Provides millions of real life examples and ties them to course concepts.  there are 3 business case papers which are really interesting and a final exam. Tons of slides every lecture.

A very interesting class. As advertised, he will give you a ton of slides to go through. Concentrate on his own material and you will do fine on the final. Expect to write about three papers analyzing case studies. His style is not for everyone, but many enjoy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2010<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super knowledgeable professor.  Go to class, pay attention and keep up with his assigned readings and you will do well.

Some content we had to copy from board.  Decent content but long 3 hours of lecture - not a lot of class participation. 2 case studies and 1 final exam.  He likes you to write a lot - include lots of examples.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2009<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Baran is a fantastic marketing professor!

If you miss a class he basically says &quot;Too Bad&quot; I'm not taking out time to teach you. His exams contain problems not covered in class or the book. If you answer a question correctly he gives you the points, but those people whose answer he likes better receive bonus points. Always grumpy, never in a good mood.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2008<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do. not. take. this. prof. His lectuers can be interested, but he  discourages class participation. Tests are vwery hard and focus more on the formulas for the stats than on methods of market research. Really, I had him for 3 classes, but only because I was forced to.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2008<br>Class Name: MKT535<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unfortunatly this is the worst professor I have had at DePaul.  He is ambiguous and rude.  When students participate in class he fights there comments and is extremely rude.  His tests were extremely hard.  They would be over 4 chapters at a time and he would ask you to draw out specific models that were never mentioned in class.  Steer clear.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2008<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of papers (several per week at times), lets graduate assistant grade the work (this is not acceptable to me), tough final.  Lectures are boring.  Textbook is generally useless.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2008<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the worst teacher that I have ever had for any marketing class either undergrad or grad. He should stick to consulting or writing books and stay clear of the classroom. Doesn't care about students and you have no idea what grade you get until a couple of days after quarter is done. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2008<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWFUL! Steer clear. Has no interest in answering student's questions in class. Does not explain concepts well, shoots down student participation. Quizzes are ok, but scattered from book, powerpoint, and lecture notes. Not helpful at all. I can't believe he's still teaching, needs to go!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2008<br>Class Name: MKT535<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Baran is a nice guy and he cares about the students, but he wasn't very interesting and made what could've been an extremley interesting class into a mundane, sleep-fest. The case studies were interesting, but we didn't have much structure in terms of actual planning strategies and formal discussion. Disappointing at best.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2008<br>Class Name: MKT525<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am so disappointed in DePaul for keeping a professor like this on faculty.  He did not seem to take an interest in students' learning, and generally did not seem to enjoy teaching.  I spend hours upon hours preparing for the &quot;quizzes&quot;, which took about 1.5 hours each.  I was happy with my grade, but do not feel that I learned very much in class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2007<br>Class Name: MKT500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a nightmare! I never thought Marketing could be so difficult. He finished the course in seven classes and he informed us that we have to study fifteen chapters from the book + his powerpoint slides + notes taken in class. What does he think we are, machines&#63; Final exam, solve all thirteen questions in three hours. Not recommended at all!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2005<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To be fair, I don't think the class is hard at all. If you do spend some time on reviewing the notes, you would get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not interesting at all.  You don't have enough time to complete his quizzes.  The grading scale is unclear.  Take his class only if you have to.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2004<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A poor professor. His inability to focus on pertinent subject matter hinders all of his students progress.

This last upcoming quiz covers ch 13-17 or 179 pages in addition to his note and power point slides.  His lectures are boring and he does an average job of explaining things.  Avoid him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He began giving out tests on unassigned days when the too much of the class stopped showing up because of his boring lectures. His notes and explanations are poor. I agree his tests are extremly long. There are 5 of them and each is like a midterm/final</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2004<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His so called quizzes are very long you hardly have enough time to finish them.  There are 5 of these quizzes and they are very difficult, do not reflect what he teaches in class.  Find another teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2004<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Clear in explaining the material but he's unwilling to offer any help/guidance when it comes to actual study.
