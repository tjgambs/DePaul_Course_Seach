I had her for several class. She helped me get my current position and is very knowledgeable about the current issues in CPS. Her classes/internship prepared me very well for my position.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2013<br>Class Name: HSC552<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I concur about the cheerleader comments. Everyone has their own style, but it was too "in your face" for me. Classes seem to lack substance and some projects seem to be more fluff focused. DePaul is not cheap, and did not feel like I got my money's worth in her classes. Would not recommend her classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2009<br>Class Name: HSC552<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Courses are fun, different, but sometimes redundant. She is passionate about her field, yes, but she is a little too cheerleady for me. I can only take so much pep from a professor. I personally need a professor not a cheerleader in the classroom, but to each his own.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2008<br>Class Name: HSC521<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome professor!  she is enthusiastic and has a passion for school counseling which makes the class more interesting.  the assignments require a bit of extra work, but you learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2007<br>Class Name: HSC521<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows her stuff.
