Take him for as many classes as you can!  His projects are rather detailed and a lot to get done in (4) 8-hour sessions but it is very attainable as long as you work together with your group.

It should be a mandatory "core" course instead of a concentration course.  Dr. Frigo and Return Drive Strategy challenge you to think differently. The things you learn in class will apply to your career as well as the rest of the MBA program.

Dr. Frigo's class will keep you informed, entertained, and enlightened - or at least moreso than any other professor I've encountered. Textbook is used heavily but Driven book is not.

It contains no actual wisdom or anything applicable to a real life situation - just vague points that sound nice, like a fortune cookie. I don't care how funny he is or how much karate he shows us.

He is the definition of a great teacher. He's inspiring and humorous in a subject that lacks both concepts. Take if you're not concentrating in accounting.

Dr. Frigo teaches this class as the second part of his stratgey program.

It is taught over two weekends and provides a lot of information, a group case to not only apply what you learned, but it also serves to show that you did indeed learn it.

Show up and you will get an A. All group work, so if that isn't your style don't worry because most MBAs are willing to do 90% of the work. Do just enough so they don't slam you in peer reviews.

And I aggree with the previous comment about his personality and ego.  ughhhhhhh Class grade is curved and lots of bonus points.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The only thing larger than his ego is his arrogance. He has a n &quot;in class&quot; persona and no personality out of the classroom unless he can gain something from the relationship.  He tells you exactly what is on the tests (mid term & final) you do not need to learn anything it is pure memorization, some of the question on the test is from his notes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As someone who came to Kellstadt with zero accounting experience prior to ACC500 (a nightmare with Shannon), this class clearly set expectations of content coverage and testing.  Topics were boiled down to a level of simplicity that made understanding very easy.  There was no test trickery and class discussion included application into actual work</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: GSB621<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the most useless class I have ever taken - BUT it was a Friday/Saturday class and it couldnt have been easier if you were in 3rd grade.  Take it if you want the easiest A with no work!!  I think the whol SEV concentration is like that!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2008<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  Hadn't taken an accounting course since undergrad sophomore year...ie, 8 years ago (yikes!)  the material wasn't easy but he was a great teacher.  Dr. Frigo tells you exactly what to study.  Don't get the textbook...95% of the material you need is in the course packet.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2007<br>Class Name: GSB611<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Frigo is a great professor at DePaul.  I rate him easy due to how well he teaches the material. I have taken him for ACC 555 and all 3 SEV courses.  I have learned a tremendous amount from him and would HIGHLY recommend taking his courses if you really want to learn something.  If you just want to an A without thinking, don't bother.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: ACCT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>M.

He keeps a great sense of humor while teaching a very dry subject and engages the students. Lots of teamwork/partners in class and Frigo is extremely clear about what he expects to put on the exam.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2007<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Professor !!

Makes class fun and interesting.  You really understand the material, even if you are not an ACC major.  The exams are pretty much directly from his packet and fairly easy.

Makes a good effort to make the material learned applicable to daily work life. Highly recommend Dr. Frigo. ...he's really funny too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2006<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, can't believe anyone said this class was hard.  95% of his test are the examples in his book (sometimes he doesn't even use dif numbers).  Don't bother witht he text, just get his packet.  Nice guy, makes ACC tolerable for non ACC majors.  Does talk about himself and his trnedy items a lot though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2006<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great energy, highly effective!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2006<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I have had a DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2006<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great experience</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2006<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: ACC798<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Frigo is very intelligent and very well read.  He can get easily sidetracked because he tends to be big picture and not much for details.  He does want to see his students succeed, but has a tear-down rebuild approach.  Attempts to be objective, but has subjective opinions about some authors; he tries to persuade you that he is the authority.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a ego centric.  He teaches you how to pass the class and if you are smart enough, how to interpret it into the real world. For an accounting class it is very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2005<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He teaches you how to pass his exams, not learn concepts.  If you can handle him talking about himself all the time, you should be ok.  Lets out early most of the time, is very reasonable in grading.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Frigo is straight forward on what you should know in his class, but is not good at explaining the material. Exams are tough, but the study guide helps you learn what is necessary.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Frigo is a great teacher. He does talk about other things in the class sometimes but it keeps it interesting. He lets the class know exactly what is on the exams, so you don't waste time studying the whole book and other crap! Grades on a curve and an easy class if you study the basic material</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2004<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very dynamic and a great presenter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are concerned about learning ACC 555 and not karate, do not take this class.
