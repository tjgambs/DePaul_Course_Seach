I just googled him because i was wondering where he went, but seems like he's everywhere; Mr. Sharath Sury this, or Professor Sharath Sury that :-) Feels good knowing I once learned from him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2010<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Sharath Sury is currently teaching at the Santa Clara University but is still listed as an adjunct professor for DePaul.  He also has a page under Sharath Sury - Santa Clara.  Finding a Professor with extensive experience and solid character like Sharath Sury will be quite a challenge!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2010<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sharath Sury did indeed &quot;Rock&quot; as a professor.  Did Professor Sury leave Chi&#63; Last i heard, Mr. Sury was still an adjunct professor, but just not recently in Chicago, is that true&#63;  Anyway, Sury was really 1/Trillion, helping students understand difficult material with very likely, scenario-type examples! Take Sharath Sury if ever possible again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The greatest professor EVER! Very helpful and test are straight forward. Very nice guy who knows what he's talking about. A lot of real world experience and if you speak with him after class, he'll give you investing tips. This guy is retired, but he still teaches for fun! He's worth millions upon millions, but he still rather teach to pass time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2007<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely one of the best teachers I've ever had.  Makes the materail fun and applicable. I'd take any course he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2007<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not a regular poster, but I feel the need to say: Prof. Sury is the most amazing teacher I've ever had.  He moves fast and covers a lot (this is a serious course), but there is no doubt in anyone's mind that his joy comes from seeing us do well.  He volunteers extra time after-class to help us with the material, test preps, & job mkt prospects.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2007<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the worst</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sury is a great teacher. He knows his material and brings in real-world examples to the classroom. (something which not all teachers at DePaul do). However, Sury needs to slow himself at times because he moves through the material extremely fast...sometimes losing students.  He helps students very much;he wants his students to do well. Tough grader</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best teacher that I have ever had at DePaul. He knows what he is talking about, he has 1st hand experience. I never missed a class, because I actually wanted to be there. Sharath is awesome and genuine...and cute!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far, my favorite prof at DePaul.  The only class I really didn't want to miss bc I learned a lot and it was fun.  Open notes/book Midterm and Final, 3-4 Homework Assignments that are scantron.  He not only cared about your performance, but he really strived you to do well in the class, and you do!  Great resource for a career in finance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is amazing! 1. He knows his****. 2. He will make you learn 3. He really cares for his students 4. He doesnt need the money but still loves to teach 5. Excellent persanlity .. not to sound like im in love with the guy but he is seriously the****.

He knows the subject inside & out & he is so into the material that its scary, but it a cool way lol...Anyways I highly recommend taking this professor if you want to learn FIN 330 the RIGHT way.  His class is composed of 4 HW, 1 midterm, 1 final.  2 bad this guy is retiring =/</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i totally agree with the other comments.  this has become my favorite class.  he is high energy, very enthsiastic (although moves a little fast at times!) and just brings that real world experience to the class, which makes it that more interesting.  on top of that he's a really nice guy and willing to help you until you get the material.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the greatest prof. ever!!

He brings a lot of energy and you can tell that he really cares about the students.  He has a lot of real-world experience that he brings to class.  He makes the material come alive.  Tough grader but you really learn the stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>yeah its early but he seems cool and intersted in the students.  He's got strong finance background so that's helpful for real world examples.  sounds like he could be tough but fair, we'll see.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2006<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First impressions from first class.
