Quiz each week on the reading--this got real annoying real fast. She also pulls many homework assignments out of the blue that aren't in the syllabus at all and this was frustrating to deal with. Again, she's nice, class is relatively easy, no midterm, final is online. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2015<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a nice teacher. Readings given every week along with reflections. Mini quizzes are given every week based on the reading(s).  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: SOC220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are not good with time-management, do not take this class. Everything is organized and clear-cut, and she is willing to help, but the work load is more than expected for an online class. Final group project for an online class was not fun whatsoever</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really easy class, weekly reflection and quizzes and an online final. Gina is sweet and caring but lectures can drag. Really knowledgable though and tries to keep the subjects interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>GIna is super cute. I took SOC101 with her and loved it. The class was pretty easy and I learned a lot. She is really understanding and extremely smart. Love her</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good teacher, even better person. She is understanding and helpful and makes class interesting. Her class is pretty easy, yet you learn a lot. Definitely take her for any class she teaches</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is fantastic! Very helpful, fun and really interacts with students. She really loves what she does which makes it a lot of fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2010<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really had no idea about this subject before entering and I was dreading it as an 8am class. However, she REALLY knows her stuff and keeps you engaged.She is super nice and helpful and gives fairly easy assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2010<br>Class Name: SOC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very nice woman who knows her subject. Although it's an 8am class, it's not too bad and I didn't dread going. I've taken quite a few soc classes and she's really not the worst teacher to have. Class is ridiculously easy if you've already taken theory, so you know.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2009<br>Class Name: SOC220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Luby is very nice and her class was not that bad.I never took a SOC class before and was still fine in this class.Lots of readings, but not mandatory b/c she talks about everything in class.Mainly lectures, but interesting.1 group project, 2 quizzes and a take home final.Take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2008<br>Class Name: SOC220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Several people have said that she is boring, I disagree.  I took her Crime and Deliquency class at 8:30 a.m. and if she was boring, trust me, I would fall asleep.  If anything she's a little timid. There's a project due at the end of the term, which is fun. I wouldn't avoid her class, but she's not the best professor I ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2008<br>Class Name: SOC105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a bore!!! A treaded going to her class every week. She is so boring, just blabs for hours. Her quizzes are ridiculous just like she is. Its a 100 level course lady! Get with the program. I havent  learned anything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2008<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so cool.  I highly recommend her.  She has fairly high expectations of her students, but adjusts the syllabus to whatever works best with the particular class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice. Will work with you to help you understand the material.  At first the class seemed like it would be unnecessarily hard, but if you read, it's pretty easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: SOC316<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady! &quot;Quizzes&quot; instead of tests - although they're worth alot they're very easy in comparison with other classes I've taken. Not an easy A, but not that difficult either. If you're having any doubts, trust this anonymous rater: go for her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: SOC316<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i've taken gina luby twice and she really is a great prof! readings, videos and guest speaker for this class are really interesting. assignments aren't too difficult. i would def take her again and i highly recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: SOC316<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really sweet lady I took Crime/Del and Street gangs with her and she made an interesting topic even more interesting! Watch videos, guest speakers, quizes, a paper. Easy to do well if do most of the reading and go to class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: SOC316<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Luby is a really nice lady.  Took two classes with her and neither were too demanding.  By the way 'boringest' isn't a word, dumbass.  I recommend Gina!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: SOC390<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is the boingest professor Ive ever had. The subject sounded interesting and she ruined it. I listened to the other ratings when I took her and what a mistake. I never missed a class, did all of the assignments, quizzes are impossible, DONT TAKE! Sooooooo boring!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2006<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>laid back and very easy.  It is not hard to get an A in her class but it can get extremely boring since she is not very outgoing.  The content is interesting but it can get repetitive</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2006<br>Class Name: CRIMEANDDELIN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice lady - really easy going - a boring class but fun project!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: SOC316<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, nice professor, do the readings and you'll be fine. No midterm or final only 5 quizzes, a book review, and an easy assignment.  As long as you try she gives you a good grade, you get 100 percent just for completing the assignments.  She's a little too into social theories other then that I recommend her.  Will take her again</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best sociology professor ever!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: SOC316<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Possibly one of the best sociology professors here. The  material is a bit redundant if you've taken classes on sociological theories before, however, it is definitely an easy A. Easy mini projects, mid-term was a breeze! Be sure to take a LOT of notes after 5th week for take home final though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2005<br>Class Name: SOC316GANGS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE CLASS WAS INTERESTING AND THE PROFESSOR WAS VERY NICE.
