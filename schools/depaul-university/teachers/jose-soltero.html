			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Buy Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />

Textbook reading optional, use for exams.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2014<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sociology is my minor, so I have a natural interest in this subject. If you don't want to make the effort, and expect a good grade this isn't the class for you. Fantastic teacher. His humor throughout classes keeps me engaged, his communication skills in simplifying or explaining concepts is awesome. Plus his accent is entertaining.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2014<br>Class Name: SOC358<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is incredibly smart and an abysmal communicator. His syllabus is nonsense (it is only a list of things to read; no dates, no times). His pickiness in all things is absurd and uncalled for. His grading system is archaic and he sets his students up to fail with the way he grades: 40% paper 1, 40% paper 2, 10% presentation, 10% bibliography.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: LST300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Peasant Rebellion was a great class.  But i felt that he was more worried about ASA format than the actual materials when writing the essays. I did not like the fact that he does not give us the access to D2L, for at least the roster, since he will not reply to questions. We should at least have access to each other. Interesting class though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: INT360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Peasant Rebellions will probably be the best class you will ever take at DePaul, which is why it fills up so quickly. Soltero is friendly, engaging, funny, and extremely knowledgeable. The amount of history he knows is truly incredible. One of the best professors and one of the best classes at DePaul. Can't recommend him enough.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has been my favorite soc professor so far. He relates theories to modern day problems. Pay attention and just know that he loves when you use modern examples. If you come to him in his office hours and show interest and curiosity he truly appreciates it. just communicate with him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: SOC358<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a cool guy but he states in the email that he will not respond to emails, he needs to get with the times/program. The papers are hard and he is picky about APA ASA format. Make sure to pay attention and take notes to his lecture only class. He's knowledgeable but he does not communicate through technology.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are a student that truly cares about sociology, then take this class.  You must read everything assigned, and be sure to take notes!  He is extremely helpful and cares about you as a student.  Also, I give him several chile peppers and his accent is delicious!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2010<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really nice but he does seem to be pretty strict. The only homework in the class is weekly readings, which are hard to understand but he explains them to you in class. Don't miss any of the classes and make sure you participate a lot because he really likes that. There is a midterm and final as well as a paper.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2010<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the funniest professors at DePaul.  Always keeps the interested whether talking about the material or going on a tangent about what he did over the weekend.  Only teaches night classes, so his class is ideal for the working student. Easy grader- gives specific intsructions on what topics to focus on for the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2010<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor. I took a night class with him and he was able to keep it interesting the entire time. He's not a super easy grader but not to hard either. The only problem is that most of you grade comes from assignments that you don't get back at the end of the quarter so if you don't do well there is no way to make up for it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2010<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2010<br>Class Name: SOCMANY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is GREAT. He is the only SOC teacher I've met that can entertain me and keep me interested for the entire class. His lectures are everything you could ask for and his midterm and final papers are easy if you read and listen to his lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2009<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>soltero is the best sociology prof. i've had. really into the subject, very smart. explains everything in detail and is there if you ever need help. go to class and have fun!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2009<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really friendly and funny, you have to participate a lot but its no big deal, he makes it easy. you have to take theory, so TAKE HIS CLASS. the material is sometimes very abstract or hard, but take good notes and theres no reason not to do well w/ him. he gives tons of examples and is just all-around awesome</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: SOC330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i recommend this professor, he makes everything easier by explaining and giving great examples from real life. plus he's nice and funny. overall great class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: SOC330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's a nice guy. relatively easy. only thing is that your grade is based only on 2 papers. midterm and final (50/50). they are not too hard. i would say that hes an easy grader. good class in general, but he sometimes can get a little boring though. but i recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: SOCREV<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know where to begin. This teacher is amazing. He's so funny, sweet, and tries hard to accomodate everyone in the classroom. You can tell he's been teaching for many years.

At first the class seemed so difficult, but he covered so many interesting and thought provoking topics that I became interested in things I never thought about before. He really cares about his students and he's the epitome of what a great Professor is.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2008<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT GREAT GUY.

He makes class enjoyable and interesting. He is also extremely easy. Do what he tells you to do on assignments and show up to every class, and you will definately get an A in the class.

If you haven't taken his Revolutions class, I really recommend it. In his lectures, he gets straight to the point, makes things so much clearer and helps you sort through the loads of bs that social science classes often drown in. Sense of humor is a bit odd, but you will love him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2006<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken a few of his classes and I can't think of a professor who was more enjoyable and helpful than him.True, you are expected to do the reading, but then this IS a university,after all,not a community college, so what do you expect&#63;&#63;!!His lectures were interesting and he always encouraged everyone to have their own opinion.Highly recommende</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i officially hate him.  he gave me 100% on my midterm, then i didnt do a reading or two second half and missed 1 class and got a B+ in the class.  he marks down everytime it doesn't seem like you have read and will call on people at random just to see this.  if u participate all the time and show to EVERY class, its  an A</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2006<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is simple- we talk and take some notes.

I thoroughly enjoyed his class.  It is easy to get an A....IF you attend class and take good notes.  His lectures focus directly on what you are tested.
