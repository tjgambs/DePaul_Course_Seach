The format for our class was comparable to a junior high English class, with the exception of an incredibly thoughtless final paper. His fave part of teaching is bringing up ridiculously polarized issues like abortion, gay rights, and Iraq just to rile students up and waste time.

Yes Meyer isn't the best english teacher i've ever had but definitely the least demanding.  You do a few readings, a hand full of assignments and a few 2-3 page papers. whats not to like&#63; He proof reads the papers before they are due.  I got an A and didnt even try.

He has a negative attitude and doesn't try to get to know the students. He's all high and mighty, PHD guy-he needs to stop looking down on the students. Also, he is so anal about grammar, it's the only thing he cares about. Worst. Class. Ever. :(</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't really learn a whole lot of new stuff in this class, we spent a lot of time talking and the assignments made me feel like I was back in high school.  Plus the assigned readings are some of the most boring passages I've ever read, and he bases the assignments off of them.  Not awful, I just wouldn't want to have another class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very funny and makes class interesting.  he is a little obsessed with punctuation, but it's only because he doesn't want us to look stupid.  he's a relatively easy grader and is interested in what you have to say.  although he likes his punctuation, he still cares about the content of your paper. highly recommended!    no midterm/ 4 papers</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does not under stand the writing for context and quality.
