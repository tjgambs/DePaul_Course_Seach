Go into office hours with your exams, he'll go over your whole thing with you in a way that doesn't make you feel like an idiot. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: CH132<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He tends to do more math examples than explaining chemistry concepts thoroughly. If you want a decent grade, you have to attend class, takes notes, and read the chapter ahead. Random class assignments, so if you miss class you have to have a valid reason or an F. If you start having trouble, contact him immediately, he'll help you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2015<br>Class Name: 801<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>He is really helpful, but sometimes he gets lost in his notes and you will be confused by his examples. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2014<br>Class Name: 205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The assignment instructions for the first week of labs was somewhat confusing, however the class became routine after the first couple weeks. The grading was pretty lenient, however many points were taken off for missing parts (somewhat confusing ) but should not represent the easiness of the professor. Very helpful in answering any questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: 15108<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's just not very helpful. Extremely smart guy! Very nice, but can be testy if you ask too many questions and isn't very helpful. Dances around questions. Also mentions lots of over your head concepts in class then proceeds to tell you you don't need to know that. Doesn't really have organized notes, doesn't really teach from the book</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
