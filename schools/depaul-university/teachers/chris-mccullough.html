Will meet with you any time outside of class, if needed.  Very kind and caring professor.  Made research interesting and bearable-- who doesn't love playing 'Who wants to Be a Millionaire' as a way to learn&#63;  Good professor, great person!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2009<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the few great teachers at DePaul.  Truly cares about his students--and our learning and professional development.  He's quirky, interesting, and entertaining.  I fully expected a class on research to be painfully dull, but he made it great.  Really great guy!  Highly recommend any class taught by him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2009<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is amazing! He is the highlight of my week. He is cute, funny, smart, quirky, and just a truly interesting and sexy person. He really wants his students to do well.

The material is difficult, but he understands this and is willing to be available for students to pick his brain.  Also, not a bad man to stare at for a few hours a week.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
