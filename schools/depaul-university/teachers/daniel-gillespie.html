			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

Study the power points for the 2 quizes and you will be fine. Exams are based off the HW so make sure you do it and correct it when he goes over it in class. Exams are written and challenging if you don't do HW or pay attention--but not difficult. He does call on people for hw answers so make sure you are prepared! Good man tho</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2011<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of my favorite professors at DePaul!

He's a wonderful instructor and makes class interesting and involving.  Doing all the homework makes the exams a total breeze because they are almost an exact replica of the homework problems. A++ highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of my favorite classes at DePaul. He brings his real life experience from the court to the classroom, class is basically 2 online quizzes, midterm and final.

He is a part-time prof. and a full-time judge, so he really knows the law and teaches it well.  His conversations were engaging, he was happy to discuss material the students were interested in, and he was very accessible to students.  Class was a lot of work, but very interesting and not too hard.  Gillespie is HIGHLY recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2005<br>Class Name: BLW500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class and good discussion</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just recieved my grade for his class.

What a fun teacher; he makes you feel at ease in his class. Other teachers should take notes about his teaching style. He makes the very boring subject of Business Law interesting for all.

He cracks jokes and makes class interesting by telling stories about the cases he tries.  I always leave class feeling completely clear on the course material.
