Beautiful personality, extremely passionate and totally willing to compromise. Very, very helpful. Cancelled class quite a bit/gave us extensions to make sure we turned in the best work possible. Let us redo any assignment as many times as we wanted until we got the grade we wanted. No book. Made essay writing bearable!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her energy is unrivaled, and her methods are efficacious in allowing students to learn in profound ways. She inspires through teaching, while still allowing students enough freedom to pursue their own interests. She expects a lot, but that just inspires me to actually put sufficient time into my work. Awesome professor! Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Way too much work for a Gen Ed requirement class. She takes herself way too seriously and just has too much intensity and talks way too class, especially for an evening class after I just worked for 9 hours. Talks fast as hell. Blunt and brunt personality. Tries to be too hard when really it isnt all that important.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: WRD281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite professor at DePaul. Incredibly understanding and motivating. Has a wonderful knack of engaging the class. This class made me very aware of my audience when writing.

Great job at teaching writing would love to take another class with her.

Extremely helpful always ready to make an appointment during office hours. Clear lectures, repetitive at times, and very nice/down-to-earth. A LOT of work: one 15 pg research paper she prepares you for well but no official midterm. I'd recommend her just because of how helpful she is. Strict attendance like most WRDs.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
