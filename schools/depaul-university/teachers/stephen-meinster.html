	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

Great professor!  Easy A if you take notes and read the handouts.  No textbook used.  Don't need to go to class but you could miss videos or in class quiz.  You can make them up though.  Take home mid term and final.  Sounds easy but its still pretty hard if you didn't take notes. Take this professor for sure great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2011<br>Class Name: PHILO1101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best class!I'm not even interested in philo.He doesn't require text book,makes readings be online,very clear on everything,explains clearly.Classes are very fun and interesting.

His lecture style is very disorganized/random and I just didn't find the classes helpful at all for understanding the reading.  Not bad for a required class- he has good stories-lectures need work</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a professor! He's good looking AND funny! Not to mention that he's a great teacher who is extremely helpful, and if you do the work, there is no reason you can't get an A. No surprises in this class. Take him if you can!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cute Professor! I recommend him to everyone. He understands us because he's young and knows how we feel with school. Only two papers (mid and Final) and somwhat some quizzes. Fair and Easy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one word for this guy, Saucy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Steve's pretty cool - Has ZERO fashion sense. Dead ringer for Michael Shanks (Stargate-SG1). As for the material, it's pretty stock classical phiosophy (Plato/Aristotle), but he does a decent job of making it interesting. Even lets you sleep.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher...has a lot of great stories that relate to what we discuss in class.  five easy quizes and two take home essay exams.  recommended</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really inspring and thought provoking. Laid back approach to subject matter, and although he jokes about not caring he is probably one of the most concerned and helpful professors. One of the best DePaul has.

Entertaining, down to earth, tries his best to make a boring subject interesting.  Clear approach to teaching business ethics.  Mixes old school theroies (plato, aristotle, smith, marcs) and related to modern society.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2003<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a little bit full of sh*t but he's really cute and I got a B after only showing up to half the classes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2003<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this prof. and the class.

Still, it's not that hard to understand if you really try and he's v. repetative, that helps. However, he's more of a preacher than a teacher, likes to talk, doesn't like to have students talk. Ttl: 3.5</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2003<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really hot and easy to understand.  He can tie in every example he has into his lessons.  There's barely any homework and only a few quizzes.  As long as you pay attention in class, you'll do good in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2003<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good at relating material.
