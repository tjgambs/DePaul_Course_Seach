Actually got me excited about boring stuff like math. Knows a whole lot about the industry, famous mathematicians, etc.   Its a tough class but you will be a smarter and better person because of it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2015<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: WD</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Alexander is very smart, but a terrible teacher. The problem is that Dr. Alexander cannot explain calculus to people who are not whizzes at math. I learned almost nothing from class, and instead spent over 60 hours on Khan Academy. This class is supposed to be for business majors. Gary teaches no business applications, more like a physics class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exceptional at conveying concepts. If you genuinely try and ask questions he will find a way for you to understand. I am not a 'math person' and I found his approach refreshing. He showed how each subject could be applied in real life.   Very intelligent, very approachable, very funny. Great guy. I am taking him again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2015<br>Class Name: MAT141<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Tough teacher but MORE than willing to help you out. if you make your effort visible it'll help your grade. He's a tough teacher teaching a tough class, but he's a good guy. Understanding and knows his students names. Very respectable.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2015<br>Class Name: 400<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While Dr. Alexander can be self deprecating at times, he is one of the fairest math teachers I've ever had. He's not one of those jerkov professors who deals in trick questions and egotistic behavior. Every question on his tests, while moderately tough, is fair and straightforward. If you're not invested in the work, you will not do well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2015<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Alexander gives extremely clear lectures and is more than willing to help on homework and studying, but you'd better be ready to work for the A. It's not easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: MATH140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a good professor . Explains very nicely, ready to help, and easy at homework and tests. Clearly gives you feedback . His criteria for grading is much lienient.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Alexander is a really cool and down to earth guy. However, he does tend to go over material really quickly and his tests are extremely difficult.  I made the mistake of not preparing for the midterm so I kinda screwed up my grade in the class. As long as you study for the tests and do all the homework problems, you should be fine. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2014<br>Class Name: 140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Over complicated even the most simple concepts. Goes way too fast over the material and belittles you if you ask questions. Also has the biggest ego I've ever encountered. Spare yourself and pick someone else.  </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/16/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He sometimes doesn''t realize that he is much smarter than his students and goes at a pace and teaches in a way that confuses the class more than is necessary. On the other hand he''s a great person that truly wants his students to succeed so he will go above and beyond for you if you reach out to him for help. He makes himself very available.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY confusing and makes statistics much harder than it needs to be. You will have to show up to class and study HARD if you want to do good in this class. Half the class he focuses on things you will never find on any test, so goodluck.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2014<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are not a Math major or you do not have an interest in Math save yourself the trouble and pick an "easy" professor. Everyone else will appreciate this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2014<br>Class Name: MAT140141<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an amazing teacher that makes each topic interesting and relevant.  I thought he was a great teacher and would advise taking him if you enjoy math and a fun class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2014<br>Class Name: MAT100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tries to be funny but fails miserably. Acts like he tries to prove how much smarter he is than anyone else and can't teach for his life. Don't take this man.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2014<br>Class Name: MAT1000<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>Clearly knows what he's doing and gloats about being a doctor. He goes super fast in his lectures and if you have a question he will make you feel stupid. He tests your patience and if you don't understand it, you're out of luck.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2014<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>The material is tough if you haven't dealt with discrete math before. Professor Alexander goes FAST, but doing the homework helps to reinforce the lecture. His exams are tough, so study for them!! He's nice and has a math sense of humor. I like the class, but it's definitely not easy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2013<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This has been one of the most entertaining classes I have taken. Dr. Alexander is a good professor to take if you "get" math, because he doesn't waste time. He's very funny, and is very open to questions that lead the class into areas "he shouldn't teach you yet". Everyone in this section is a good student so the pace is quick which is refreshing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher does not use mymathlab which makes the class that much harder to understand since he is terrible at teaching. He teaches as if you already know the material and skips steps when doing problems on the board. He is not clear at all when explaining materials and thinks everyone is as smart as he is. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He can be confusing and go off track at times, but he sincerely wants you to do well in his class. He gave 5% extra to anyone who attended every one of his classes and invests a lot of final grade weight into whether or not you actually tried to do well and learn. Just be prepared to learn some of the material on your own time if you take his class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very very boring professor. He himself knows how to do the math well, but can't relay it to the students. Therefore, be prepared to teach yourself the material. Was not clear as to which homeworks were required. Did not post midterm grades to D2L or mymathlab so trying to figure out your grade was difficult. Do not take if you have other options.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
