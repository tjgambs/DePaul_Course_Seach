	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

You have to work for it, but if you want to come away from a course with an understanding of how these texts can affect the way you think and live as a HUMAN BEING, take the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: ENG363<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>He definitely knows his stuff, but all he does is tell you what to write down, there is no discussion and his midterm and final are not easy. If you want to do well you have do the readings and go to class. He calls you if you don't go, so don't take him unless you want to be lectured at and watch pointless films in class every other day.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2013<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I believe that he was once a good professor, but I feel as if he is losing interest or something. If you do not like blindly following someone else's opinions don't take this class, because you are graded on how well you can reiterate him. We watched a lot of videos. Make sure you pay attention to "buzz words."</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2013<br>Class Name: ENG386<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>super intense. knows a LOT about the short stories/novels we cover. he literally does all the analysis for you except for the final paper and final exam (which are the only 2 grades for the whole course, just warning you). i think people have mixed feelings about him but i really liked this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2012<br>Class Name: ENG110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Came highly recommended, but I have to say I was disappointed.  Insightful, but NOT good at getting the students to interpret literature, because he does it for them!  His class structure and grading are fair, but I fail to see the allure from people who took more classes from him--unless they like being spoon-fed!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2011<br>Class Name: ENG395<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He cares that his students whether or not his students are absorbing the material but he is a &quot;my way or the highway&quot; professor, and for an English class that doesn't allow you much room for interpreting readings because if you don't agree with him you fail. I think he probably used to be a good professor but he is starting to go senile.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2011<br>Class Name: ENG360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took most of Dr. Ingrasci's American lit classes as an undergrad at DePaul. They were all amazing! He is a very entertaining and knowledgeable lecturer. He does not use a text book - just the original work plus a thick book of lit crit articles and the like.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked this class and the professor.  We had a midterm, final, and paper. Just show up to class (don't miss or else he'll call you ha), listen to the lectures, and be open to learning a new way of thinking that is different than the norm.  The $30 packet he gives you is like the guide to the class. I recommend getting the books from the library.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was awesome.  With Ingrasci, you either love him or you hate him.  If you're open to changing your views on life then take him.  If you're set in your ways- don't.  Really easy class, he just lectures the whole time and we watch movies! He's a really brilliant professor who actually cares. Paper and final. That's it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2011<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Are you all serious&#63; He had interesting material.. but he didn't act professional towards any students. He swore WAY too much, even for a university professor. And 30 dollars for some paper&#63; One, no way in hell. Two, taking money from students is illegal. He's smart obviously, but also a tool.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2011<br>Class Name: ENG465<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best instructor & friend I ever had -- from my B.A. through to my M.A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ingrasci is crazy. In both good and bad ways. I found it a little hard to understand his train of thought, but he was so eccentric that I enjoyed his classes. He also swears up a storm every class. You'll do well on his tests if you use the buzz-words that he puts on the study guides. He's not my favorite professor in the department, but he's fine</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2010<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes you pay $30 for readings he prints and puts into a book for you.He gives them to you the first day of class then tells you he needs the money because he's paying for his (adult) children's schooling and apartments. Says there aren't enough courses at DePaul based on values and so this class emphasizes values. Have to rent/watch nine movies</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2010<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very intelligent.  A bit eccentric.  Has an unshakable grip on the classroom agenda (a bit controlling), so don't expect it to be lackadaisical.  Funny.  If you work hard and show interest and respectfulness, you can stay on his good side.  He's just as concerned with teaching about morality and the human experience as he is about teaching English.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2009<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Ingrasci three tomes as an undergrad. Now, that I am in Grad school and almost finished I can without a doubt conclude Ingasci is the Prof. that I inspire to be. Arguable at times and certainly bias, he is a true animal when it comes to lit. If you don't take him you are missing out on a true human experience.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Self absorbed, endlessly relates works to his own life.  Over emphasizes his own wordings and interpretations.  When reading a work out loud he litterally adds words to it as he sees fit.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2009<br>Class Name: ROMREAL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Genius.  One of the FEW people I have come across in my life who can tell it like it is, and still maintain heart.  He is the reason I teach today.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2008<br>Class Name: AMLIT386<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Phenomenal, brilliant, sublime. While Dr. Ingrasci's ability to make us think may seem comensurate to his ability to scare his more timid students, make no mistake, he is without a doubt thee most inspirational professor I've ever witnessed.  While some may find his oratory dogmatic, the man is living evidence that genius is often tumultuous.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2008<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have graduated from DePaul 2 years ago in English and I can say that the reason I teach the way I do today is because of this man.  Try as hard as you can to take his class as part of your education at DePaul.  You only get one chance to live his great class do it now!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2008<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is ridiculous. He is so vague about what he wants, yet is so demanding about being specific. He will not help you at all so don't even think about asking because you'll probably just piss him off. You'll get a decent grade after being completely depressed by listening to one of his &quot;I hate the world&quot; lectures. Buzz Kill. Don't recommend!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2008<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The only down point I would say is that he is a little jarring at times and if you disagree with a reading that he has of a book you are wrong; He is very Static (once you take his class you'll get that joke). With that in mind I still say that he is the best English Prof I've had at Depaul, just not very forgiving on opinion you'll never be bored.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: ENG300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Somebody give this man an award.  Yes, intimidating at first.  After that, just a wonder.  Great man, great teacher.  I thought I loved literature before his classes.  He showed me what it was to live it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: ENG386<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hugh Ingrasci is the best prof. in the entire school at depaul, bar none. its amazing how much of a cult following he has. but with good reason, intense, interesting, and overall makes you care about literature.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2008<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken him 4 times. Yes he can be intimidating at first. But sometimes you just look at him and think he's the sweetest old man. I love his class, he really keeps you on your toes. He likes to curse and yell (not at anyone). Take him, he's an interesting man. You won't regret it. Easy grader</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2008<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>had ingrasci 4 years ago & still think about his lessons. took him undergrad 5 times & in grad school. i still e-mail him to this day. the man changed my life. he awakened my love of literature--so much so that i'm now a high school english teacher. his lectures are so riveting that i've cried on the DL in class. no one is better.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2008<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am a member of the Ingrasci cult movement...while I was in college I took five of his classes.  Now that I have graduated, my students hear Ingrasci stories all the time.  Whenever I begin to feel burned out I stop by to visit him.  He is welcoming.  Bull to anyone who says he isn't (clearly you haven't stopped into his office).  Take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2007<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes you work hard, but you're rewarded for it in the end.

Have heard he is great for Film Noir but often got confused about which book we were discussing in this class. Dominates lectures. Relies too much on movies to take up class time--an hour spent watchign different people sing Amazing Grace&#63; How is that relevant&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2007<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought Ingrasci was incredible.  Cool English majors never want to take another prof again after they've had him.  He gets so worked up that he starts foaming a little at the mouth-- and that's awesome.  He is pretty aggressive and doesn't really count on student participation, but that's fine.  We all can learn from Prof Ingrasci.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2007<br>Class Name: ENGL465<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too many texts and not enough time to discuss/process them.

May not always encourage discussions but presents info in a way that is helpful. Exams make you think and the papers are no less demanding. If you like to draw your own conclusions his classes are for you. Text books are always used.

He's intelligent, but does not encourage discussion. Regurgitate info. Not approachable! Swore at me when I asked him to explain an essay prompt. Will not meet with students outside of class! Not helpful! If you want to think for yourself, don't take this class! I got an A-, but it dropped my 4.0 GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i've taken ingrasci for a bunch of classes. the dude is completely insane in all of the best ways. tells great stories, totally realistic, kind of a ranter, but it's good. trust me. take him just to witness the entity that is hugh ingrasci. if nothing else, it'll be a class that keeps your interest the entire time.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a fairly smart, but he's also incredibly condescending and dominates lectures. Students are almost never encouraged to participate, unless it is to answer a near-rhetorical question to which he has an incredibly specific answer to. His handouts and tests are also very messy and unorganized, and a lot of time is spent w/ movies w/ no relevance.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2007<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This has been the best class and best teacher I've had at DePaul. He makes class interesting and fun, but also learn A LOT. We had to read 3 books (good books so it wasn't hard) and take quizes on them. Also had to rent a lot of movies and watch to discuss in class, but watched a lot of movies in class too.

Show enthusiasm for the subject and try to understand things the way he does.

I found him to be a fantastic instructor, simply the best I've ever had.  His lectures are riviting, and his choice in texts is superb.  There is nothing &quot;arrogant&quot; about him whatsoever.

Ingrasci is capable of teaching you a plethora of things, but is it really teaching when his is the only applicable conception&#63; Take him if you would rather be preached to than taught.

Take any class you can from him!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Ingrasci is an extremely intelligent man, he has tons of life experience and will teach you a lot about literature and life.

Very strict and will pump you full of more information than you could even think about aquiring, but seriously a genius.  TAKE HIS CLASSES!!!  I took three and would love to be able to go back for more.  Be on time.  Be prepared.  Be ready to read like a mother.  He can teach you so much.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the most interesting professors I've ever had. I really got alot out of his course, more than I ever expected.  Probably one of the best professors at DePaul period!  He is NO pushover, If you take him, expect to work hard. He can come off as a bit of jerk sometimes, and expect to read a ton.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: MAJORAUTHORS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He comes off like a jerk, but he is great!  He knew I was struggling with some of the stuff, and he was very understanding.  He just wants you to TRY!  He's unbelievably interesting if you can just get past what he wants you to see as his arrogance.  He's brilliant, and he really cares about his students, even if he acts like a jerk sometimes. :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: ROMANTICISM<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very challenging, but the best class I've taken yet.

Ingrasci's a great lecturer, but prob not too good for younger peeps, or those with tude. He will force you to read more than ever in 10 weeks, but you walk out with a brain overflowing. This class really is a rehash of his Romanticism class, which is great.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2005<br>Class Name: ALLOFTHEM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The prophet is good, but I call him the rock star.

There was no open discussion of class material. Orders were just barked at us. Otherwise, an easy class to do well in if you gave him exactly what he wanted.

Can be easy if you do exactly what he says, but can be fun if you challenge him and call him on his b.s.  Willing to help you with your grade if you show initiative and talk to him outside class.

I do not understand why so many people think he's so great- he's at least passionate, but other than that he has nothing on some of the great teachers at depaul.
