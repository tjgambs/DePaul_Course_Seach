It is a mistake to pick any other professor over him if they are teaching the same class. He is all about critical thinking and participation . What makes Laith a god amongst men is that he utterly detest busy work (dont expect any).

You don't really need the book but you must take good notes.  He is very knowledgeable and will keep you interested.  Midterm was easy.

Super easy, funny, extremely intelligent. No homework (read 4 chapters total). Midterm was to define 10 terms in 1 sentence. No final: instead, a group debate and a group paper. Almost always ended class early. Class was cancelled about 5-6 times. TAKE HIM. His lectures are life-changing and inspirational! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2014<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best professor I ever had at DePaul! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I have had at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2014<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Really enjoyed this class and had completely no interest in it.

Don't buy the book even though he tells you to. He only says that because he was an editor of the book and wants people to read it but it's not necessary to read for anything in the class. Easy A. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2014<br>Class Name: REL263<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's everything these responses put him out to be but he really is an interesting.

As a teacher, he is very disorganized -the syllabus and book are useless. He is incapable of setting his opinions aside from his teaching, & stifles dissenting views. I got the feeling he didn't want to teach the class. Major superiority complex! Take for easy A, not if interested in subject matter</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: IWS101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Laith is a great!  He presents the material in a manner that is so interesting, and really makes the class challenging (in the way that he makes you think) and fun.

Definitely recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: REL263<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Basically, gave no H.W. with the exception of 3, 2.5 pg essays. Only assigned readings once during the entire quarter, and they were optional! He truly cares more about his students actually learning the material than taking tests on it. His jokes were funny as heck during lecture. Would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2007<br>Class Name: REL116<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME TEACHER!!!

Assigns long, sometimes dense readings, but study guides are really thorough so the readings are basically optional. Also assigns a lengthy term paper, but offers lots of help on it. Seems to favor the Muslim kids somewhat over others, but that aside he's the best teacher I've had at DePaul so far.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2006<br>Class Name: REL263<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr Saud is the best professor i have ever had the privaledge of learning from.

He encourages students to think outside of the box and brings philosophical views as well as historic facts.  This  has been the best class I've taken at Depaul with even better professor.  Take his class, you won't fall asleep, if you do he will make sure everyone in class knows that you are......</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: IWS217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy was actually pretty damn good teacher.  I actually enjoyed going to his classes every week and I'm not fond of school.  He gave extensions on papers even witht he lamest excuses.

(funny/smart/good lectures) 1st few weeks were rough cus i knew nothing about Islam/MidEast politics. MT & F werent too bad, he gives a study guide. 3 2.5pg papers were more challenging.
