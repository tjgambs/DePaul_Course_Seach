Little nerdy guy. Super smart. Very helpful. His mind thinks faster than he can speak so he stumbles a bit sometimes. He does ask a lot of questions to keep everyone involved.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2013<br>Class Name: MOL213<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Shellko definitely knows what he is talking about. He tends to talk fast making you feel like you are having an information overload. He is a very funny professor. He didn't seem to care enough to learn everyone's names (there were only 18 students). Overall, he was a good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2013<br>Class Name: LAT113115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really made me enjoy Latin this year. Helpful, funny, and knowledgeable. Take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2013<br>Class Name: MOL213<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED THIS CLASS! Took it for learning domain and it was great! It's easy, one short paper, plays are short and fun, Shellko is funny, nice, intelligent, and dedicated. Tests are doable. Study and you'll do well. He'll show clips of The Onion and Big Lebowski to start each class of and set the mood. Take good notes, he doesn't write many on board</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2013<br>Class Name: MOL210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is clear and concise. Very helpful and willing to give extra time and help to anyone who needs it. Definitely read and attend class to ensure a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: MOL221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the greatest professor i've ever had. So nerdy and awesome.He can move really quickly through the material but always answers students' questions. He is just so neat and wonderful. But maybe that's because I'm nerdy too....</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: LAT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>:)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: LAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can tell his mind operates at a rate much faster than most people's. He also moves really quickly through material, but as soon as he realizes he's going too fast, he'll take time to slow down. The course material is difficult, but I think he is aware of this, and will not hesitate to take to time to make things easier for you. Smart guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: LAT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher, lots of quirky jokes. It's a language class so obviously attendance is necessary but it's only an hour 4 days a week. It can get a bit hard, but he's an easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2010<br>Class Name: MOL212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just had this teacher last quarter.  I really enjoyed this class.  Another thing that I loved about this class was that there were seriously only 10 students in my class.  Everyone was able to speak his or her mind.  I knew nothing about this class before taking it, but still managed to get a B; Awesome!  The videos in class aren't that great!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: MOL211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher and awesome class. He's super awkward but in a fun way. He's totally willing to help you with any questions you have! I would recommend this class to anyone and everyone!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: GRK101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very willing to help students, often has review sessions in class, has a quiz every week but often reviews for it immediately before</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2006<br>Class Name: GRK101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice man... Really hard material!!! This class requires LOTS of reading/studying/memorization outside of class! Quizzes every week. If you're trying hard & still stuck, talk to him and he will go out of his way to help you. Responds quickly to emails if you have any questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2006<br>Class Name: GRK101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Odd man, will turn you off at first.  He was not difficult, just the material.  Ancient Greek is a difficult language, but it was bad when he rushed when pressed for time.  He does try to be helpful, having study sessions right after class.  He just started teaching at DePaul, so perhaps he is still getting his feet wet with teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2006<br>Class Name: GREEK101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kirk is a very helpful teacher with a decent sense of humor.  It seems that if there is any way to help his students he will try it.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
