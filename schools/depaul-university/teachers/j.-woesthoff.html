She pushes you because she knows you can do well. Like I said, she can come off very stern and strict in class and grades a bit harshly (i usually get A's on my papers and she gave me all C+s), but if you come to her, she'll keep working with you to help you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2014<br>Class Name: HST298299273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a tough grader, but her comments on the papers help you completely revamp your paper to get a better grade. She loves what she teaches and that makes the class more interesting. I recommend her if you want to learn something about history and historical writing. She definitely brought my writing abilities to the next level.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2014<br>Class Name: HST273301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is a TOUGH GRADER I've never recieved so many check minuses in my life. She interrupts students when they explain themselves, and has no consideration for people. Definetly DO NOT take her class if you're looking for an easy A! The readings were interesting though</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: HST298<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly intelligent and passionate, Prof. Woesthoff really knows how to run her classroom. She is always engaging, and actually manages to lead a discussion amongst the entire class without lecturing. All of the necessary information is given, and everyone gets to Participate. Fantastic historian, and really knows the trade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2013<br>Class Name: HST223<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Woesthoff is a genius! She knows how to run a classroom! She is a very hard grader, but her comments are ones that students NEED to hear. She is an extremely helpful teacher who is very passionate about conveying the real history to her students. I would recommend her for a teacher whose work requirements will benefit you in the long run!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked this professor and her class is really interesting, but it's not easy. I went in for help on a paper and she made me re-do it 4 times. I never could figure out what she was looking for and she contradicted herself. Super Hard Grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: HST298<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I cannot recommend Prof. Woesthoff enough. She is one of the few professors who is genuinely passionate about HELPING her students succeed. She offers unique and devoted expertise as a historian, which is highly engaging. Although the class isn't easy, her approach keeps students motivated to perform. 298 and 299 literally taught me how to wr</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2011<br>Class Name: HIST298<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very cool. Easy going (even if she appears strict) and passionate.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2010<br>Class Name: HON301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes the class pretty hard, but she just wants you to talk. As long as you read some of the stuff and contribute in class she'll like you. The final paper is 50% of your grade which sucks, but I did pretty bad on it and still got a good grade in the class. She makes you work hard but grades nicely if you put effort into the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2010<br>Class Name: HST273<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, she is a nice lady, but a hard grader. be willing to work hard and read every night if you want to get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2010<br>Class Name: HON301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Professor Woestoff! She is very knowledgeable and truly cares about her students. She is always available to meet outside of class to go over anything. You can miss 2 classes but going is interesting so it won't be hard. 1 small paper, 1 research final paper, 6 sets of 3 discussion questions. Challenging class but very interesting. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2009<br>Class Name: HST272<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think that she was pretty good professor. The class was pretty much discussion for the first half and some lecture for the second half. She is quite demanding on what she asks of you but that comes with the territory. The reading was kind of hard but you can get through it. Just show up for class, participate, you will do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: HST273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Alot of reading but mostly they're short. She is clear and wants her students to understand the concepts. Like the post before said, you have to take notes, which will help you in the midterm and the final, which are essay based.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2008<br>Class Name: HST173<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT CLASS! THERES A LOT OF READINGS EACH WEEK FROM HER COURSEPACK AND SMALL PAPERBACK TEXTBOOK, BUT IF YOU DO THE READINGS, THE CLASS IS EASY. LECTURES ON POWERPOINT, MUST TAKE NOTES BECAUSE THERE IS NO MAIN TEXTBOOK. SHE IS VERY CARING AND LOVES TO HEAR HER STUDENTS OPINIONS. 2 PAPERS THROUGHOUT THE CLASS 5-7 PGS EACH. MIDTERM & FINAL ARE ESSAYS</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2008<br>Class Name: HST273<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class 4sure needs a pre req!!! She basically talks all class about the readings that will not make any sense to you unless you read them about 10x's and thats not a joke!!! She doesn't care if you are trying to learn, even if you go in to her office hours for extra help, she is rude about helping you and makes you feel dumb!! DON&quot;T TAKE HER!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2008<br>Class Name: HST330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class.  Very fair grader.  Plus she is very very very hot, especially with that accent.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: HIS273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor. Do the readings, as the class is heavily based around them. Very knowledgeable, but encourges and loves to hear students' opinions. Study for exams and you'll really get something out of the class. Take her if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2008<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher.  Just remember to do your readings.  and she is a hottie.  haha</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2007<br>Class Name: HST330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To be honest her class is very difficult, especially if you miss one day of reading.  She is also a very harsh grader and sometimes expects more than what a student can give.  Having said that her class is very interesting, with readings that are applicable and relevant.  Although, I do warn you, this class will be a lot of work, but it's worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: HIST217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor. Really knows her stuff and is always available for help. I had very little knowledge in the topic prior to the class and came away with an A. And am I the only one who finds her attractive&#63;&#63; Brains are hot!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2007<br>Class Name: HST272<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>bottom line you need to know about this subject before you take the class. if you do you can get away with not reading and still pass. i never read anything n i got an A. if you don't have an indepth previous knowlege of World war II then don't bother. if you do def take this class because it is very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2007<br>Class Name: HST270<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is BRUTAL! Unless you have done out side research and really are familiar with the subject, AVOID!!! THE WORST AT DEPAUL! FIRE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2007<br>Class Name: HST272<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: HST272<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I felt that this class needed a prerequisite!  I didn't have any other history classes prior to this one and I didn't understand a lot of the stuff that she was teaching so I had to do the readings several times until i finally understood the point.  If you're interested in history then take the class, if you're not, I would stay away from it...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: HST212<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very lecture oriented class.she basically talked to us all class period and there was no real interaction among students.textbook was a booklet of articles she put together that were not the easiest to read.she has very high standards and i felt nothing was ever good enough for her. i thought the subject was interesting but she ruined it for me</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
