Definitely recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>REALLY HARD for a 100 level.

Most of the time I feel like he is making fun of every religion we discuss in class, even his own...  Class is very discussion based, and he will put random students on the spot if no one is answering.  The only grades are a few papers, which are easy because he gives detailed guidelines.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2012<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor, amazing person, amazing theologian.

He was intimidating at first because class is very discussion based, but everyone in the class gets used to it. Theres a lot of reading, but they are good, fast reads, and there are four papers for the quarter. Attendance is mandatory, but the class is interesting so it goes by quickly. I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2011<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Throughout the whole class I kept thinking &quot;Wait, is this a philosophy class or an intro class&#63;!&quot; Either way, DON'T TAKE IT. Halstead rarely references from the book, so there was no point doing the reading. Everything on the exams were from the handouts, which he never tells you that. He has favorites, which were philosophy majors. Also, he's rude</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2010<br>Class Name: REL287<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Halstead is awesome. He really knows his stuff and keeps the class discussing. The readings and work are hard but I actually learned in this class. I would take him again, but he is very challenging.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2010<br>Class Name: CTH248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I recommend NOT taking this class. The readings, even for a college level are ridiculous and are hard to understand.  The articles you read for class are okay, but the books you read you can't understand.  Grading is hard and you have to have exact wording in order to get an A on anything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: REL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT and i repeat, DO NOT TAKE THE &quot;ROMAN CATHOLIC MORAL TRADITIONS&quot; or &quot;CONTEPORARY MORAL ISSUES ON HOMOSEXUALITY&quot;!!! if you love doing endless readings and spending all night doing the final paper go ahead. this class is NOT interesting as it sounds in the course description! THIS IS A WARNING!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2009<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is amazing. He comes off as being way intimidating but he knows his stuff. He keeps you on your toes, and isn't a bad grader when it comes to papers.

The helter-skelter way my mind works and the logical thoughts that he explained to us just didn't coincide. Regardless, he is an exceptional professor and person, very approachable and incredibly knowledgeable. You can see the passion in his face. Quite challenging as far as grading goes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2008<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredible professor!!! He is hard and will challenge you to question your beliefs about religion, life, yourself, etc. BUT the rewards you will reap are invaluable. He has changed the way I look at things, and because of him I am considering a minor in philosophy or religious studies. TAKE HIM!!! He is definitely worth it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly challenging, occasionally hair-splitting, but thoroughly fascinating discussion and lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: CTH213<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really struggled in this class and I had a lot of trouble with the papers because he picks them apart!

His classes are one of those that you'll remember for the rest of your life.  If you're awake and alert, you take away a helluva lot from his lectures and discussions.

It was intimidating at first, but as we got into disucssions the material was interesting. It will definitely affect the way you look at and think about religion. If you don't mind putting in the effort, definitely try and take him. And try to make time to have him go over your papers with you. It's incredibly helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2007<br>Class Name: HIST110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor.  Very unfair in grading and cocky. Take him and you will no longer have respect for Christianity. His teachings are so horrible you loose respect and admiration for such a faith.  The religion is unstable as he is. How can you possibly take a religion seriously when it is changing it's way of living and thinking everyday.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2006<br>Class Name: REL110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS GUY. He is so arrogaunt. Dont have to really read any parts of the bible cause he goes over it in class. tests are fill in the blank and ridiculously hard. You have to write 2 papers 5 pages each inorder to get an A or B in the class. He is a waste of time for your time and money.

He is very understanding (pushed back a paper when students asked) and so smart. You will think about everything differently after his class. Impossible not to learn.
