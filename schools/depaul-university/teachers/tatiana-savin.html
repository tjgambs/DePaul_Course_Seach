Her accent is thick, you can't understand anything she says. All she does is examples but never tells you how or why. I took her class to avoid an 8:30, at this point I would have rather taken the 8:30.DONT TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I followed the material she wrote on the board during the lectures. No listening, just copying. Went home studied the notes, did the homework, A on every test. She probably doesn't hear herself talk, but her notes are good.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2003<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher i have ever had in my life.  can't understand anything she says or does</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2003<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy if you already know the material.

You can't understand her accent and when you ask her a question she doesn't understand you.  Her tests are really easy if you learned the material already, but if you haven't, don't take this class.  I taught myself everything.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2003<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teaches everything step by step, she has an accent but is very thorough.

I can barely understand her accent and she confused me on stuff I already learned in high school.  She doesn't even grade the hw or tests.  I had to teach myself everything at home and still had to go to class to get the hw.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
