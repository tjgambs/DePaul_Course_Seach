	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

How does he still 'teach&#63;'  Horrible teacher.  I got an A only because I knew material prior.  He is horrible.  Very unclear on what he expects for answers on tests, and he mumbles all class.

He only goes over easy example problems in class then hits you with extremely hard problems on tests.  You never know what to study for and your grade will suffer because of it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2004<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do NOT take him!

He doesn't bog you down with tons of homework problems, the homework isn't due until the class after next, and all the tests are graded on a curve.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2003<br>Class Name: MAT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for Geometry (he wrote the book) and Abstract Algebra, and I must say that I was more confused everyday when I left.
