As previously mentioned, expects the exact words used in the book not a demonstration that you actually understand the concept.  If you do not provide her exact answer, she will mark you down.  Would never take her again for any reason.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: HCI210<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok...she teaches out of the book 24/7...if you write an answer that has the same meaning as that in the book, she'll mark off if its not like in the book....all her powerpoint slides are derived exactly from the book as well. Very boring and definately not worth the money. Not taking her again</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: GPH395<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are looking to learn, you should find someone else.  The point of a senior capstone class is have a grand project that you can show off to a future employer.  This class spent 10 weeks learning basics in flash leading up to a final project that was a webpage!&#63;!&#63;!  I was highly disappointed and cannot believe that noone has complained. BAD!!!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
