He has been my most favorite Spanish professor at DePaul yet. He has a GREAT sense of humor, his tests are not hard, and he makes the class VERY interesting. The lowest grade I got on a test was an 89% and it got dropped. He is also VERY quick at replying back to emails which is very nice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2009<br>Class Name: SPAN104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really great professor. He's been my favorite professor so far. Very laid back and has a great sense of humor. Participation is really important in his class, so if you're not comfortable with being put on the spot, don't take the class. If his class wasn't so early in the morning and at the Loop, I would definitely take him next quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2009<br>Class Name: SPAN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this prof.'s class twice, and I'm glad I did. He's very easy to follow and has a great, laidback teaching style that really helps you retain the information. Plus, he's a funny guy! Interesting activities, readily available, and good test prep. I'd take his class again in a heartbeat.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2009<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is awesome, i havent taken spanish in years and he really does a great job of teaching it. The homework is all online but if you can use the books it easy. He gives all the points he can on the test, so that you PASS. Hes really awesome, and realizes not everyone just took 101 last semester and he's really accessible.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
