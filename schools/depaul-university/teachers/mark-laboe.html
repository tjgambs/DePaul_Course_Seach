Pretty easy class, just a couple of papers, not a hard grader at all.

Overall, I was not satisfied. His grading is wack and makes no sense. The mans got good intentions but he just needs to be practical and realize we all don't want to be priests or nuns.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/17/2009<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For my discover Chicago class Mark taught 'Wealth Poverty and God'. It should have just been called,'God God and God'. He doesn't listen to anybody and is cocky.He puts a Catholic smear on everything. Although he is kind, there is a hint of a condescending tone whenever he speaks. He'll bore you to death too. Do not take a class with this man.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark is a really sweet guy and he really cares about each of his students, but his class is kind of pointless. Unless you want to devote your life to volunteer work and being catholic, then this class may bore you a bit.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2007<br>Class Name: DISCO200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Prof. Laboe for a discover chicago class my first year... TALK ABOUT AWESOME! There was always something with his class, never boring... he was a great teacher, makes you think. He does assign many papers but he gives you chances to make them up, he's definitely someone i'd reccommend</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2007<br>Class Name: ISPISP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great person!  He cares about your life outside of the classroom.  Always willing to help no matter what it's about.  Gets students involved, several papers, but he gives you the chance to rewrite them.  As long as you rewrite them you'll get an A! I would definately reccommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really a great guy.....u write a ton of papers and class can be kinda boring sometimes because he tries to cover a lot of ideas and thoughts. talked about a lot of pressng issues and some debates in class.really cares about ur career at depaul and u can talk to him and get a hold of him anytime. good guy....field trips are great!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2006<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher at DePaul. He seems like he cares a lot about his students. Expect a lot of class discussions about deep thinking , which can lead to being kind of boring, but over all, pretty easy class. The fields trips are interesting, but the two hour class hauls butt. Participate and REWRITE your papers over again and you shouldn't have a pr</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2006<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was not that interesting but he did his best to liven up the conversations and realy get you thinking.
