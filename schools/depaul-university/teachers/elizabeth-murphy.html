She is very rude to all her students. She almost made a girl cry during class for asking a question. You pretty much teach yourself the entire class.

Going to class is a waste of time. You have to teach yourself everything. Make sure you don't fall behind in this class or you will be in very bad shape. She does not really help. She is nice though, it is just her teaching and her tests that got to me.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think that she was a hard teacher and that you'd need to work a lot for her class; getting an A is not impossible however.

She curves the midterm and final and believe me when I say this comes in handy. She is tough but a very good professor if you really want to learn the subject. I recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2004<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SO CHALLENGING!
