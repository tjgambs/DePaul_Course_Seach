I am graduating from DePaul and still consider her the worst professor I've had EVER. She gets upset when you ask questions and she rushes you so she can catch her trains. Everything is self taught so not sure why this is not an online course instead of her classes. Would NOT recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2015<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor is NOT helpful at all. Rude at times. She said class wasn't mandatory but then half way through got pissed and changed it to mandatory. DON'T TAKE HER. So much work to be done too. She doesn't look at the homework assigned, she takes your word for it being done. Midterm was super easy, study objectives and you'll be  okay.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2015<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A for marketing. 2 papers, 1 group project, and 3 exams. she's a little quirky, but nice and interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2015<br>Class Name: 202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly recommend for 202.  You learn on your own time but she helps you if you don't understand. I took her night class and we only turned our assignments in every Wednesday then left.  She will stay and explain for those that need more guidance, but she assumes you understand. No lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2015<br>Class Name: 315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>She's a super nice person, but all over the place. She's an easy grader, though. As long as you try she's fine. I had her for 202 and she was easy but she's really confusing for 315. I recommend her for 202 but not so much 315.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/15/2014<br>Class Name: MKT315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Challenging work but she is always opened to helping if you need it. Take-home final, no midterm, final group project, and 4 outlines of material covered in class. If you hate exams and would rather present, take her. Highly recommended! Also no text needed</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2014<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class itself is very challenging (online videos and final project) but she tries to help even though she is not suppose to. Take her for 202 over anyone else. She wants everyone to succeed and is a very kind lady.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a nice and funny teacher. She gives you the answers to the mid term and final tests in class. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you go you'll get the answers. She ends class early everyday and she is always open to meeting with her students. highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: PRD244<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She doesn't care at all about you. Her tests and grading are extremely hard. Gives no guidelines at all about anything. If you need help you're out of luck. Avoid her class at all costs</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor. She's an old school Sales rep that worked at black & decker, and she talks about it non-stop. She really does mean well, but she is unbelievably unorganized. She does not tell her students about when assignments are due or when exams are. The class itself should not be difficult, but she somehow finds away to make it confusing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2013<br>Class Name: MRK201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME! Really funny and absolutely fantastic professor. Really helpful inside and outside of class. Makes marketing really interesting and applicable. Would definitely recommend taking any class from her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very misleading. Exams are tough. Take notes only on what she emphasizes on and buy book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very misleading professor. The exams are harder than she says they are. I recommend getting the book and only taking notes on what she puts emphasis on.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I do not recommend taking her for this class. She was extremely easy and I finished this class learning absolutely nothing. She was super unclear about the final project and responded rudely to questions in e-mails. If you want your entire grade based off a unclear group project, take her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXTREMELY easy A. She literally repeats what will be on the midterm or final by saying it twice. Classes often ended early, I didn't mind. I feel that I actually came out of this class more mindful of advertising and more literate in media. She clearly knows what she's talking about and will tell you what is actually used in the professional world.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not recommend her for this class. She's nice, but class was boring, dull, not challenging, and a waste of my time. Class would usually only last 30-40 minutes and she cancelled a lot. Homework assignments are a joke. She is unclear about the final project and is lazy in general. I felt like she wasted my time and money.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2012<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Surprised its been 2 years since someone has left a comment. She hasn't changed! Still an awesome professor. Class is very informative and she also includes funny stories to keep the class engaged.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2010<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best marketing teacher hands down. Basically gives you all the midterm and final questions and answers. The paper isn't hard but you have to put forth some effort. I love her because the class is not only easy but the knowledge you gain is priceless</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not terribly difficult.  Do the paper as soon as you can and pay attention to what she says regarding exam questions.  If you do that, an &quot;A&quot; is not hard to earn at all.  Seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2010<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher seems cool and out going. She is, but be prepared for the Midterm and Final. The question are very wordy. Make sure you read every word. Over all if u just want to pass this class take it with her. If u want an A+ then take it with someone else. DO NOT BUY BOOK!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2010<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really helpful. You learn a lot. Take this prof if you can, you won't regret it! Assignments are unique & interesting. A must-take class for anyone wanting to go into marketing or sales!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really interesting teacher. Makes content relatable with her vast real world experience. She made no effort to learn students names and seemed to prefer boy students over girls. When I asked her for one on one help she was sort of rude. Her tests are easy and assignments are interesting</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2009<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME professor!  She lets students leave like 45 minutes early, and there is no &quot;class&quot; on the first day; she just hands out the syllabus and off you go! She is hilarious.  She always talks about her nieces and nephews...hope she was my aunt.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2009<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice lady and easy. She doesn't care which edition book you buy, i used 3rd ed. She leaves us early.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2009<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate marketing but she makes it actually interesting!

I was in 301 and three of my classes weren't cancelled...We did have group work days where most people blew off class. Of course coming to group days helped m,e get an A.

She met with my group on a saturday afternoon. Exams graded and posted within two hours after class. Projects graded and final grades posted before end of session - that is NOT lazy!! She is best prof I have had as far as willingness to work or help students!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: MKTG310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fair teacher. Expects you to do more than just regurgitate material - critical thinking and reading text a must. Not an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her tests were not really based off the slides. They are EXTREMELY difficult. She barely explains or goes over the slides. I thought her class was a complete waste of my time. The group project is BS! I got a B- in the class but totally deserved at least a B/B+/A-!!!!!! RIDICULOUS!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2009<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. V! I really like her a lot. Has a lot of real world experience and talks a lot about it. Pointedly highlights everything on exams during class. Great personality. End group project felt vague, but we got a good grade. I felt cared for as an individual. First day of class she'd already memorized everyone's names and literally named all 30 of us.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is stealing our money! She canceled 3 classes. Only teaches a hour each class. Fly's through and skips slides. Doesn't really TEACH, she just tells stories. She takes off a lot of points for not following every single unclear guideline. Worst thing is, she makes you think she is teaching you everything you need to know. Not recommending her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.V is LAZY.  She even admits it over and over again.  She skips over half the chapter, yet still puts it in the test so READ THE BOOK or completely avoid her.  not worth the effort.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesnt teach.
