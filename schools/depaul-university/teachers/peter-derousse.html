DO NOT recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: LAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this class unless you are incredible with languages and can teach yourself. It is too much memorization for one class, I was always doing Latin. When I struggled he was extremely unhelpful and I ended up dropping the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2008<br>Class Name: MOL210<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely hard class. if you dont read youre screwed. he uses too many greek words no one understands. expects way too much reading every week. he acts like his course is the only one youre taking. i really do not recommend this course to anyone at all</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2008<br>Class Name: HST285<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please don't take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2008<br>Class Name: HIST101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>we love you peter!!!  :-)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: HST296<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard but rewarding class. A lot of reading, difficult homework essays, and one 6-8 page research paper.  Despite all the work, I lked this class a lot. Derousse is a really great lecturer, but I would only recommend him if you are interested in the subject. If you aren't, you will probably suffer through a miserable quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2008<br>Class Name: LAT114<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Derousse is not an easy professor to handle and Latin is hard as hell already. However, he's extremely helpful and thinks about effort when grading. So, if you do want to take Latin, or any classical courses, take HIM. He is intensely in love with all of it and can go deeper into anything you want. What's more, his lecture style keeps you riveted.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2008<br>Class Name: HST296<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not as hard as everyones making it out to be.  There is a lot of reading and its not a typical history class in the way that its quite analytical and a lot less along the lines of memorizing facts. He clearly know what he is talking about and enjoys the subject matter, however staying awake for it is difficult, don't take in the morning if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2007<br>Class Name: HIST294<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hard teacher with lots of work, hard readings. and he uses words that i dont even understand. not an injoyable class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2007<br>Class Name: HIST294<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart prof. but half the time i didnt kno what his words meant cuz they were so complex.extreme workload you have to read 100+ pgs a week and the readings r very hard. the final paper was the hardest thing i have ever done.and many of his requirements r just rediculous you get swarmed with work.very tough class it takes up so much of your time</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2007<br>Class Name: HIST294<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very intelligent,but he would use words that i dont even kno,half the time i was wondering what the words mean.you get lost with all the names of places and what happens,extreme amount of work. easily 100+ pages of reading per week plus very difficult work.the final paper was the hardest thing i ever did...requirements r rediculous.very tough class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: HST294<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Somewhat tough.  He knows the subject extremely well.  However, relies heavily on the reading assignments and likes students who participate in discussions.  Lectures are booring.  Take good notes and do the readings and you should get a decent grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2007<br>Class Name: LAT101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he knows alot about Latin and the roman culture, but he never actually taught the language to us. i dropped the class because i simply can't stand his teaching style. he goes off on tangents often, and randomly comes up with something we should know.. the text is about as helpful as he was...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2007<br>Class Name: HIST296<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a tough grader, seems a bit smug, and is prone to holding pop quizzes.  However, he is a very good teacher.  Class is always interesting, and I guarantee you'll take a lot out of it; I really enjoyed the assigned readings, too.  So, recommended, but only if you care about the subject matter.  If not, you'll suffer an awful quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2007<br>Class Name: MOL210<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought this class was extremely hard. You HAVE to read... and I would suggest looking up annotations on the readings on the internet. Essays assigned at the end of class with no makeups. Multiple essay midterm and final. This class is a lot of understanding and analyzing. Do not skip going to this class. You need to be there.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: HIST296<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knew his stuff, and the class is not all that diffucult, but he is EXTREMElY boring. He is very nice, but I was about ready to shoot myself in the head in every lecture. He is extremely helpful though.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2007<br>Class Name: HIST294<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2006<br>Class Name: LAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Latin itself is extremely hard, but Derousse keeps you interested. It's not so much the language, but the history of the society as he teaches it that is intriguing. He wasn't very lenient, but if you did you work on time, and studied hardcore, you were fine. I was one of two freshmen in the class and pulled a B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2006<br>Class Name: LAT101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I thought he was a little smarmy, but he's funny and he has interesting anecdotes.  You have to really do you homework and practice a lot, but overall he's a great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: LAT101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He used a book that was incredibly difficult to follow and understand--it also didn't give us half the information we needed, and when he was asked to clarify he just confused us more.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2005<br>Class Name: HST296<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher, a bit boring at times but his smile will keep you awake. very smart and almost intimidating, but if your one on one great guy.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor may have just had it out for me but he was a total ass!
