			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top left.<br />
			6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-"" in the table and re-click "Generate Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. <br /><br />

Although she didn't give much partial credit on exams, her exam questions, which  were much more calculation-based than theory-based, were not very difficult. Overall, Dr. Wolbach was the best professor I had in the gen chem sequence and I would take her class again!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: CHE142<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: WD</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely terrible.

Overall a great lecturer during class and definitely knows the topic. Exams are tough  but if you study you should be on top of your stuff and do well on them on top of the extra-credit she gives out occasionally. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2014<br>Class Name: 138<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>She seems very strict and mean at first but that goes away within the first week. Her tests are very hard, most problems seen on exams have never been seen before. If you genuinely want to learn chemitsry take her class, otherwise it will probably be really stressful. She offers a lot of extra credit and curves the class too so it's not too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: HON225<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's awesome.

She is clear in class and is always available for questions. Not going to lie, her tests are extremely hard, but they are designed to push you to think critically about the problem, just like you would have to do in real life. Can come off as intimidating, but is really super nice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2013<br>Class Name: CHE202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class over the summer. It was pretty easy. If you go to lecture, pay attention, and do all the homework problems, you should be good. She will test you on most things covered in class so make sure you review your lecture notes. The key to this class is knowing how to use/program your graphing calculator to solve statistics problems.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't really know why she is getting bad comments, she is seriously the nicest woman ever. She really cares about her students and creates opportunities to better your grade if you had a rough test. She prefers groups and gives extra credit for groups, but it's not mandatory. Pay attention and you'll do just fine :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2009<br>Class Name: CHE205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, I could not ask for a better teacher. She taught both Gen Chem and Quantitative Analysis, and she was always clear and organized in lecture and approachable outside of class. Granted, her tests were challenging and designed to push, but I feel that I am a better student because of her. Love this woman!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2009<br>Class Name: CHE205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wolbach is extremely smart and will challenge her students. Nonetheless, she is always there to answer any questions whether it be pre-grade a lab report or answer a homework question. To do well in CHE 205/207, you better do all the assign problems and get the lab reports pre-graded with her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is awful. If you can you should test out of it as soon as possible. She's nice but I found the homework to be hard and the activities to be aggravating. You do everything with a partner so make sure you get a person you like and is smart. The group activities are maddening. Take this class as a night class with a different teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: CHE106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome. Super smart and explains things well. Granted I took a 100-level class, but it was very easy. I didn't have to study for her weekly quizzes and still did well. She's nice and eager to help.

She is one of those people that knows how intelligent she is and makes you feel like an idiot when you ask questions. Her tests are 50% fair 50% stuff you have never seen before. She said that her tests are supposed to show that you have mastered the material.. not simply memorized it. Hardest class I have ever taken.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok... here's the rating on Wsquared.

You need to study a lot for her tests to pass them with a satisfactory grade. If you don't study and do your homework, you will be lost in her class. I like her way of teaching because I learned a lot.Some people think that it is the most boring subject in the world, but I really enjoy it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2007<br>Class Name: CHEM113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall I think Dr. Wolbach is a hard teacher but if you study (a lot) you will be fine.  Her tests are very difficult and long and you need to know what's going on.  She is extremely helpful outside of class and helps you understand the material better.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2007<br>Class Name: CHE106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not easy, but Prof. Wolbach is so helpful and writes everything you need to know for the tests on the board in detail.  As long as you study hard you will do great in this class.  I recommend her, she's awesome!  A lot of people didn't like how she gives 1 quiz a week, but I think that really helps boost your grade and know the info.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2007<br>Class Name: CHE127<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I usually didn't bother with the text. I just went to class and did all of the homework.  Her explinations are very clear and she did tons of examples.

I went to every single class, and studying an inhumane amount of time and I still failed over half of the tests. The tests are all calculations and the numbers come out of nowhere.

She really should just be a full time researcher and not teach. She never offers help even when you ask her because she has to do her research.
