Extremely knowledgeable and has many stories from his personal experience. You'll gain invaluable insight on Chicago politics from him.  He also likes to drop hints about law school if it's something you're pursuing!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2013<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Alright, so I have reviewed Quintin King in the past, and I am one of his most avid/rabid fans, but I just did not enjoy this particular class as well as I have others. For one, the course readings he disseminated were incomplete and actually made me WANT to purchase a textbook. Also, the class got very off subject at times which was annoying.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2013<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor King's class is a blast to go to. He is laid back but I learned more from him than any other class. Easy(ish) A. Take him</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2012<br>Class Name: PSC229<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly recommend taking this Professor! He makes class fun to attend. Really knows his subject and teaches it with a passion. He is very helful and treats every student with respect. Easy A! Case studies are fun to write and group presentations are fun! I will be taking him for more of my political sciene classes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2012<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If your thinking law, take!!Going to his lectures are half the fun of his class + you do learn a lot from him if you listen to what he's saying + not just writing it down to regurgitate for your midterm/final. He's really relaxed and fun, and a very smart overall guy. His class is pretty different from most "normal" classes, so heads up for that.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2012<br>Class Name: PSC229<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No attendance required. Nice guy, smart and pretty funny. He hates responding to e-mails, as openly admits it. Doesn't always hand back work. If you hate presentations, dont take this class. You'll have to give several. Overall class was fun, and I felt I learned something.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: PSC262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Insightful, witty and perpetually engaging. Quintin King's classes are optional, but it was a pure joy showing up to class every day. His courses were run just like a law class, and truly embodied the Socratic method. The reading requirement was high, but the knowledge gained made it worth the effort. Take. This. Class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2011<br>Class Name: PSC262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does not require you to buy costly books, so that's good. Do not be afraid to participate so please do not be a mouse. Don't be that quiet follower. At least speak your mind even if you are not an expert. Read the material and the exams will be obvious and easier to articulate. Why pay money if you are not going to have any input so speak up kids!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: PSC262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will not regret taking his class, he makes the topic so much fun. Even though attendance isn't a big deal, showing up makes your two exams a lot easier to deal with.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2011<br>Class Name: POLI261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great, cares about the learning process and actually teaching what we need to know...Only prof at Depaul in poli sci encouraging to go to law school</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2010<br>Class Name: PSC261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>interesting teaching method....EXTREMELY helpful</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2009<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. And, the other rating on his &quot;Ease&quot; were a little unfair. He's really not that hard if you try. Makes you think critically, class is fun, and you leave with very valuable information. Class was never boring. Also, not an unfair grader and he's not insane about due dates etc. Very funny guy who knows how to teach. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: POLI260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor...will work you very hard...Readings are boring BUT he makes them come alive in class...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2008<br>Class Name: PSC200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST CLASS EVER!

Got a B+ and this was one of my first political science classes. Watch out if he calls on you and expects you to know your stuff for participation points. 1 midterm, 1 term paper, 1 final, and 10% for participation. Great Teacher!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
