If you don't understand something, ask him, go to his office, he gives very clear information and explanation. He tries to give many extra credit as much as possible.

Kind of dry content but he really tries to make it interesting and compelling.

By the end of the course, besides grasping a thorough understanding of the subject, I learned that "you cannot judge a book by its cover". I wholeheartedly recommend taking professor Fernandes' classes. Great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's the reason i switched my major to psych..awesome, cute, fun teacher! Cracks jokes..may seem a little monotone at first but you learn to love him. Very helpful and makes class fun. His lectures aren't boring. Gives quizzes but it kinda became into attendance.
