Her lectures are monotonous & all over the place & she allows students to say horribly offensive things without correcting them. Definitely does not create the safe learning environment DePaul advocates. Not a difficult class but I would steer clear if possible</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2015<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Heather Easley was a life-changing professor for me. She was so helpful with feedback on papers and really wanted the entire class to succeed. She has a tough attendance policy ( -10% if you skip 4 or more classes) but her class goes by so quickly it's hard to want to skip it. She LOVES Harry Potter! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2014<br>Class Name: SOC221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Easley has easily become my favorite professor at DePaul. Her ability to share her knowledge and generate thoughtful discussion is astounding. Her passion for people resonates strongly in everything she does. She truly wants students to learn and succeed, and will go to great lengths to make sure they do.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2014<br>Class Name: SOC235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a hybrid Adolescent Health class.  I really enjoyed the material, no textbook to buy, very easy class.  There are a few writing assignments that will go well if you work hard.  She really wants people to post elaborate things on the discussion boards. Great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE Professor Easley. She is very fun, interested in the topic, and liberal. She is one of the best professors I have had at DePaul and solidified my decision to become a sociology major. She is clear on expectations, and one of those is to read the textbook. There are chapter summaries online so that should not be difficult...</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
