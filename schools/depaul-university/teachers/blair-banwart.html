			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

One of the best experiences I've had so far at DePaul. He is passionate about the subject very understanding about missing class and late work.  He's also super chill and funny. One thing i didn't like about the class was that he didn't tell you any of your grades so you don't know where you stand until the end of the quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2014<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVED him!

He is very chill and easy. It gets kind of stressful though the quarter though because he doesn't grade anything until your final grade has to be put up, so you never know where you stand.

The assignments were actually really interesting, and if I could take him for WRD 104, I would in a heartbeat.

He's funny, tries to get kids interested in the class, and a down to Earth guy.

It's pretty much what you'd expect from a freshman-level English course, but he's interesting and personable, and makes it more bearable.  Class discussions can actually be pretty lively and fun, and I always enjoyed the videos and short stories he had selected for the class to work with.  Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome guy, plain and simple.
