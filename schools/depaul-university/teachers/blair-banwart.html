Makes it worth taking an 8 am, easy class but also makes it interesting. You can clearly tell he cares about the class he's teaching. (plus he's extremely good looking)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2015<br>Class Name: 202LEC<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy to talk to, gives good feedback, and understands you have 3+ other classes, work, commute, etc. I loved his lectures as well. Intellectually stimulating, but not extremely difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher, tries his level best to make class interesting and entertaining. On the first day he tells you he hates talking a lot, but then class becomes only tangentsrants usually, its kind of annoying. His assignments are clear cut, but not particularly interesting. He's a good guy though, didn't mind taking his class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this teacher. One of the best experiences I've had so far at DePaul. He is passionate about the subject very understanding about missing class and late work.  He's also super chill and funny. One thing i didn't like about the class was that he didn't tell you any of your grades so you don't know where you stand until the end of the quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2014<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVED him! He is super chill, honest, and is clearly interested in the subject matter. He started every class with a song submitted by a student, which I thought was pretty cool, and was always willing to help you out. Is it weird I'd love to be friends with him?</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked Blair as a professor and as a person. He is very chill and easy. It gets kind of stressful though the quarter though because he doesn't grade anything until your final grade has to be put up, so you never know where you stand. Other than that though he is a very passionate professor and makes the class fun.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Blair was an awesome professor. The assignments were actually really interesting, and if I could take him for WRD 104, I would in a heartbeat. I didn't want the quarter to end, only because his class was so much fun and so interesting. I would DEFINITELY recommend Blair. He's great.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST TEACHER. He's funny, tries to get kids interested in the class, and a down to Earth guy. He had interesting assignments and, although some of the readings were lengthy, they were interesting and got you thinking. I recommend him to anyone going into WRD 103 (unless you're a Sox fan...then things get awkward.)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Blair is fantastic!

It's pretty much what you'd expect from a freshman-level English course, but he's interesting and personable, and makes it more bearable.  Class discussions can actually be pretty lively and fun, and I always enjoyed the videos and short stories he had selected for the class to work with.
