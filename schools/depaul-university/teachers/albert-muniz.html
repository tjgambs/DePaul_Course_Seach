Seriously makes you think about the topics. Requires reading and participation in the class matters, but the readings are really up to date and interesting. I was seriously laughing out loud for the first assignment. What professor gives an assignment which makes you laugh? 3 papers and that's it. If you work and read, solid A. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2014<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Proff Mu√±iz is extremely knowledgeable in consumer culture. He has amazing material, and always keeps material extremely relevant. Great lectures. Only downside is that there is lots of reading to do, and hard to get around all the material. Great class and definitely recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2013<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor. A ton of reading, all on D2L. He likes discussion in class and online. There are three papers to write. We watched Fight Club and Ghost World. You will have to write an essay on each movies using support from all the readings. Not a difficult class. He is very motivated and likes to talk. A bit of an aggressive attitude.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2012<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Muniz is amazing! His class is very interesting. As an accounting major I got to discuss many real world topics that normally would've never crossed my mind. He is very unbiased and the class discussions are interesting. Take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2010<br>Class Name: MKT542<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING!! Attendance isn't totally required, but helpful. Plus the class is so interesting you really won't want to miss it. Class discussion is mandatory but he helps it flow and keeps it relevant. Assignments/test are all take-home and fairly straightforward. Do the reading! Hard but fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2007<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've ever had. Hell, one of the best teachers I've ever had. Make class interesting and knows his stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2007<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best. class. ever. Topic is interesting and important. Readings are tough but good. Professor Muniz is so clutch it's not even funny. Clever and nice but sort of quirky. Take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2007<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE WHOLE SMELLING GREAT (NEVER GOT THAT CLOSE) BUT HE IS AN INTERESTING TEACHER.  HE IS NOT A JERK, JUST LIKES TO GET TO THE POINT.  THIS WAS BY FAR ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CLASSES I'VE TAKEN AND RECOMMEND IT.  I'M NOT A MKT MAJOR, BUT HE MADE THIS CLASS EXCITING WITH HIS LECTURES. THANKS PROF MUNIZ! :-)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2007<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>How can you call him a jerk or say he has a chip on his shoulder&#63; I thought he spent too much classtime being impartial and playing devils advocate of the different sides of all the arguments. I can't tell where he stood on the issues which was the point so that we could arrive at our own opinion ourselves. Everyone should take a class like this.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2007<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of a jerk, but a good teacher and class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2007<br>Class Name: MRKTB<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Muniz is GREAT!  He has great stories (especially about his girlfriend).  Funny, inteligent and thoughtful make up his great character and a great class!  Besides all this, he smells WONDERFUL!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2006<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talk about how consumer culture infiltrated our society. Makes sense, but fails to realize that although we have now been exposed to these faults, what can we do to fix it. Stand out from social norms and be outcasts. Talks with a chip on his shoulder and assigns long boring readings.  not the best class in the world</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2006<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't see how any can say this class was boring. (&#63;!&#63;) It was one of the most interesting I had at DePaul. Alot of the readings were tough, but the discussions of them were good. How many classes let you watch Fight Club and get you to see it in a different way&#63; Great prof too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2006<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He isn't that bad and he's not a hard grader if you follow the writing guide.  but honestly, the class is boring , boring, boring and your required to read lots of difficult articles.  be prepare to participate/discuss in every single class since participation worths 30% of your final grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2006<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best class all year</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked it and the professor alot. cant believe the comments here. stop whining and go to ITT.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2006<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too many readings (difficulT) aside from essays and group stuff.  Class participation if worth ALOT and need to go to every class or your grade will suffer.  You stay in class all night and very long lectures. Good luck for those who are trying to graduate</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is horrible as well as the professor. I tried so hard and always went and talked to him, but he was no help. Everything everybody is saying is true. He is a tough grader and missing a class or not participating can jepordize your grade. You don't want to risk it if you plan to graduate soon, because you won't. Take an easy class for your</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very tough. This class is a pain and I would recommend taking someone else if possible. Hard grader and not helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2005<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has a great teaching style (and is prolly one of the better teachers at DePaul). Expects alot, but also by doing so, it makes you learn and think. He knows this stuff (and is funny). Many readings (some hard), two assignments, big final essay, group project and CLASS PARTICIPATION (counts for alot). Some hard work but worth it. Take if you can</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2005<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A professor you wouldnt mind gettin lectures from, he made class fun however there is a huggee amount of readings and participation is a GINORMOUS chunk of ur grades so thats all you have to worry about.  Next to that are just 3 papers and a group discussion that you have to present on an article</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was an OK Class. He is a bit of a tough grader though. 2 assignments worth 30%. Readings every week, Participation is worth 30%! You must talk in class or your grade will suffer. One easy group project worth 15% and a final paper on a movie for 25%. Interesting class, but hes a tough grader, you have to participate to get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2005<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Big readings. Big ideas. Big thinking. Big on participation. But all he is trying to do is get you to think... on interesting and important things. I liked it a lot. As long as you attend class and participate and work at it, you can do good. He makes class fly by and he likes the topic. And the movies are cool even if ghost world was boring.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked this class and it wasn't as much work as everyone said it would be.  Cool movies too and it was fun to do something different. Prof. is very nice and helpful with questions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2005<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was absolutely the most interesting class I ever had.  He really made you think about things you don't normally think about in everyday life.  Things that really matter.  2 Years later I still talk about things that came up in that class. The discussions were amazing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2005<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class/instructor but hard work.

As long as you are interested in the topic, you should do well - as long as you attend class and participate, everything comes together. Class was definitely fun and the 3 hours flew by.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a real tough grader.
