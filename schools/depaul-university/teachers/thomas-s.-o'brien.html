Always let us out early, like 7:30ish.  Teaches straight out of the book (literally- he opens the book and reads it to us like a bedtime story.)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2007<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ugh! okay I first have to say that the class is torture, but this isn't  about rating the class, it is about the professor. O'Brien did his best to make ethics interesting and the case studies he had were great to relate concepts to the 'real world'. If you attend class, do well on your papers, and have a positive attitude you will do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: MGTETHI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class, I really enjoyed it, now graduating, and it is one of the easiest classes. Lots of reading, but very god guy and lets you re do papers. Enjoyed class discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2006<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is not the same teacher listed as Thomas O'Brien above - Thomas S. O'Brien teaches finance and Thomas W. O'Brien teaches in the religous studies department.  This teacher is passable if you read the book.  25% Midterm 1, 25% Midterm 2, 25% Final, 25% Project.  Read the book!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>25% 1st midterm, 25% 2nd midterm, 25% final, 25% project. You need to read the book to pass the class. Plus we have to find a insurance agent in real life for the project. He curves a lot. and he always let us out in night class. You will be more than fine to pass the class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very cool teacher, just show up for class and participate.  Participation is what will boost ur grade.  3 or 4 papers, not bad</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class and professor overall, but only likes his own opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2004<br>Class Name: MGT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher.  Very interesting and helpful.  Just do all the reading and be prepared for class.  He gives you the test questions prior to the tests so you know what to expect. Definitely take him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall a good teacher.  Lectures are intresting.  Do the readings you'll be fine.  Papers are a cinch.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've had at DePaul. He's knows his stuff. He encourages  participation during class dicussions, which are always engaging. The topics relate to real life and are always interesting. You'll do well if you do the work.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked this class considering i loathe philosophy. OBrien doesnt get into deep theories or anything. The class assignments were a walk in the park... i did most of them the morning they were due!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
