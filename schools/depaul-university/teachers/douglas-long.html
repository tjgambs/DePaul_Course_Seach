He loves movies - talk to him about any of them! He's great to talk to and enjoys conversations with students. He also will work with you and your schedule if assignments don't get done on time. He's so nice. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE Doug! He is such a nice man.  I took his Hitchcock class and it really changed the way I view movies.  He teaches perfectly and really pushes you to be the best you can be.  I would HIGHLY recommend taking your LSP120 class with him, no matter the subject! </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for my Freshman Focal point Seminar - Hitchcock. good teacher, obviously passionate about his subject, very friendly and helpful, and helped to keep interest and facilitate discussion. Plus, at least for this class, there was no textbook, cause he said "the films are your text" :)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2014<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take Doug's class. It's really easy with a low work load. Easy assignments and an easy grader. He's really nice. The only negative is that you need the book but it's cheap. Lectures can be boring too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You weren't supposed to have theater knowledge going into this class, but if you don't DONT TAKE IT. I've asked for help because I kept getting c's on analysis papers and he brushed me off. With that said, he's a really nice person...but if you don't like theater he doesn't like you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2013<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doug is by far one of the best professors at DePaul. I took the Honors Explore: Chicago in Film Class and he really was great. He's extremely helpful, very well organized, and is passionate about Chicago. He takes legitimate interest in all of his students and really wants them to succeed. Take his class. You won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2012<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the Chicago In Film portion of this class. Doug lets you call him by his first name, which really tells you about how this class is going to go. He's really personable, the kind of guy you would just like to have a beer with and chat. He's really knowledgeable about film & wants you to succeed in life, not just class. A genuinely great guy</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2009<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Doug! Let's you call him by his first name, and is very easy to talk to. Easy class, easy grade. Very helpful on the final project.  Definitely take Doug if you can! You will not regret it.  He is funny and enjoyable. Take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2009<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doug is a good professor to have. My section was on theatre in Chicago- and he was a great resource because he has worked in the field and knows people who work in Chicago theatres. He is flexible and understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2009<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Long is the kindest teacher I've ever had. He actually cares about his students, and his enthusiasm about the subject makes you want to love it as much as he does. An easy grade, and a good time. What's not to love&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There seemed to be a ridiculous amount of work for a class that I was basically forced to take (Chicago in movies will never be an influence in my life), but the class itself is fun. He keeps things interesting, and you'll gain a few insights on history, if nothing else</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Long is great. Funny, charming guy, organized, worthwhile class, good off-campus excursions. Had weekly 2-page papers that he promptly (and leniently) graded and provided feedback on. Also he looks a little bit like Thom Yorke, I think. Take his classes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Long is awesome!

Great teacher, down-to-earth, easy to get along with.  You do NOT need a background in theatre to get a good grade in this Explore Chicago class.  Had a few readings, and weekly essays that were due on Saturdays, but overall, very enjoyable, and highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2007<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very kind and knowledgable man. Loved the class, but was more interested in our outings and speakers than the class portion itself. Take the class!
