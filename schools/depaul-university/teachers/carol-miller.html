She was a little condescending to students and taught in the same routine every week. Get into groups, review the reading and answer questions together to be discussed as a group. Became monotonous. However, I enjoyed the discussions with other students, so that got me through it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>IS very opinionated and never teaches, simply voices her questions/opinions.  Class is driven by group discussion as facilitated by groups.  SUPER easy class though</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2006<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Miller is the most inept professor I have ever had at DePaul.  She is unprofessional, judgemental and critical of everyone except for her obvious favorites.  She becomes annoyed when people ask her questions, maybe because most of the time she is unable to answer them.  I feel I have wasted my money on this class because of her.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2006<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel that someone teaching a class about middle school should have taught middle school. She hasn't. She doesn't even know about the structure of CPS and that there aren't many middle schools in CPS. I don't feel like I learned much at all about how to teach middle schoolers. Find another prof with MS teaching experience.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2005<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you require a clear syllabus with explanations, do not take her.  Even after questioning she did not clear up confusion.  Group work took over every class period- not sure if she can actually teach.  Don't bother buying the texts if you can help it because she does not utilize them.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2005<br>Class Name: SCG401<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She didn't teach anything. She had us all do presentations on the course material and buying the book was a huge waste of money. The class was a joke and yes, she is a very nice person and nice lady but not a good teacher. She barely spoke.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
