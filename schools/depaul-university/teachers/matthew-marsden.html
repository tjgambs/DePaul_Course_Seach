DO NOT RECOMMEND.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: ANI206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked Matt. He's hilarious & extremely passionate about animation. As in, he knows everything. He's smart, quirky, & well-spoken. The class is kind of boring, as it's just him lecturing in a dark room. I found myself asleep from time to time, and I sat in the front row. But it's definitely an interesting class, and Matt is well fit to teach it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2013<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Matt has a great interest in his job. He'll try to scare you off at the beginning of the class, but if you have some technical skill you'll be fine. Papers are kinda vague and his directions are off but it's an easy A. But there is a TON of work that is required. Don't buy the book, haven't used it yet.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2013<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He tries to scare the class in the beginning. He is overall a nice guy but has a long list of pet peeves that he will go off on. Just do the work and youll be good. Must go to class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: ANI206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I mean, he can be funny at times, but the class was extremely boring. It was hard to concentrate when he turned off all the lights except the projector, and the whole time he just sat at his desk and talked for an hour and a half. Difficult to stay awake, but easy to get an A or B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2010<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I have had at Depaul the guy is hilarious and the class is fun not to mention easy A.  I'd for sure take him again if I could</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2009<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh Marsden... he was a fun guy to have class with, but he was very particular about certain things. As long as you complete all of the projects, you should do fine.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
