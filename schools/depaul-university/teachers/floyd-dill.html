He curves tests.  take decent notes and read the book somewhat. If you want to get an A, skim over the book before class then read it again a before the tests. Try and go to most of the classes too if you want a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So what, he looks like the monopoly guy, if that will keep you awake take this class.  He is very boring and sometimes makes mistakes, (Double check GDP notes) but the midterm was easy with a nice curve. It's not hard to pass, just hard to be inetersted.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2005<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The old man needs to retire, the good thing is that there is no homework, so he grades on your mid-term and finale. Thats IT !! and both are very hard, he does not review for any of the test, therefore he will failyou, like me. He is not reasonable or mercyful, even if you talk to him.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hardly paid attention and missed a third of the classes and i still got a B, he tells you what is going to be on the tests</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: MACRO<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unbelievable, this guy gives you 2 tests..Midterm worth 40% and final worth 60%...he does a terrible job explaining himself and cant even hear, hes way too old to be teaching.
