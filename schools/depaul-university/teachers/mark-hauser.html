After that there isn't much left to learn about pirates unless you're going to be a pirate historian. He would give group projects and then on the day they are due not cover them. I wouldn't take him again, and don't recoomend takin him once</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for a focal point, and he is the most irritating prof. ever! He is unclear about what he wants and when he wants things, gives us a huge assignment two days before they're due,and never follows through with what he says he's gonna do. It might as well be an online course, cause everything is done outside of class. stay away from this man!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2006<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got an A.

He's not clear on what he wants, he's not all that interesting, and while he does pick some good books to read, he fails to make them the least bit interesting discussion-wise.

Take him if you truely want to learn archaeology but not if you are just looking for an easy blow off class to fulfill a science lab requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2006<br>Class Name: ANT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't even read his name cause you do not want to be in his class. He doesn't utilize the class time efficently or effectively. He ask too much from the students and does not realize that we as college students have other classes, personal life, work, and other projects to do. There a lot of reading for each class, group projects and insane paper!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take his class. He is not helpful, clear, or nice.

He doesn't believe in concrete answers, but rather analysis.  His discussions is really great and he is very helpful outside of the classroom.  The grading is somewhat unclear, but he is very direct with whats he expects of us. He may be hard, but he is the real deal.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most unclear prof I've had yet.  His lectures were all over the place.  The daily assignments are easy, but he gives you almost no guidelines for the papers.  He's not as arrogant as other people have said, but he is somewhat full of himself at times.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is very arrogant...and really puts students self esteem down! I dont thing that is his intention but he definitly needs to work on his people skills and his teaching skills...</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2005<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are incrediible boring and unclear. The assignments for the class are a small essay based on the readings do every class session and 3 observation assignments and a critical analysis. If you go to his office he is really helpful on getting you started on your 4 major papers and the every day papers are fairly easy if you read. However i wouldnt take this class again if i had the choice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2005<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are incrediible boring and unclear.

Seriously, this was the easiest class I have ever taken.  Simple exams and assignments.  I am an anthropology major and this was by far the easiest anthro class I have ever taken.

It's week 8 and we still haven't gotten our assignments back. I have no idea what is expected of me, and I doubt he even knows what he wants. Has potential to be a much better prof. but not yet.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2004<br>Class Name: 120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although he is somewhat entertaining in class - he is not very clear with instructions for lab - He kinda expects you to understand everything he's saying - Probably would not take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is over my head and then some!  He's not very organized BUT he is very nice, tries to make class interesting, available outside of class and will speak with you afterwards--not flexiblwith due dates and if you are bad with daily assignments steer clear.  Other than that I recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2004<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you've taken an archaeology course before, you're set. Great prof. One smallish lab a week. A small assignment here and there. Keep up with the light reading load and talk in class... you're set. I adore him. Very funny.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2004<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great professor, small class. DO NOT BE INTIMIDATED on the first day if he makes fun of you. The class is fun and comfy atmosphere. Interesting and different. HAUSER ROCKS!!!
