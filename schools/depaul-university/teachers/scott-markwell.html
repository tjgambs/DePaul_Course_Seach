	    	<h2>How to Use Mocksched.com</h2>
			<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
			1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
			2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
			3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
			4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
			5) Once finding a good course section, press the add button in the table. This will save the course to course cart.<br />
			6) After adding the courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Generate Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press the minus button in the table then re-generate the schedule. <br /><br />

			If you need any more help please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched" style="color:#aaa;">mocksched@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!

He'll call you out for every wrong thing you say, and challenge every argument. Doesn't hand out As; you must work hard for them. Very arrogant and full of himself, but he's not sensitive so you can voice your emotions.

The instructor is very arrogant and rude.  For example, this session the entire class was seniors and day one he said (a direct quote) "Your all seniors so I can pretty much assign whatever I want and you have to do it since you can't afford to fail or retake this class".

He is definitely not an easy, and makes you work hard for an A, but if you put in actual effort you will do well. He is very sarcastic, and isn't shy about his political beliefs but I loved that.

I figured the class would be easy, and it was, but I fear for the freshman who come into this class and have to deal with an ill-prepared professor. He often loosely described the assignments in class and you could only guess what he would actually grade them on. Doesn't use D2L.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher, but I found him extraordinarily arrogant. He was always talking about the generation he teaches being the least literate and how incredibly inept he thought we were. He generalized everyone to fit his notion of young people.

The comments here don't do him justice. He knows what he's talking about and plus he's HILARIOUS! I would definetly take him again. The textbook we used was Exploring Languages.

He is always willing to set up a meeting and is clear when explaining things. He expects a lot out of you but I feel that after discussing other WRD classes with friends, you will take the most out of his class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The man knows rhetoric and will pound it into you.

I highly recommend avoiding Markwell. You will dread going to class and hearing him use the fact that you are a captive audience to be his soundboard for lame jokes and male chauvinist remarks.

Professor Markwell crosses that line on a fairly regular basis. If you enjoy learning concepts of argument that you should have been taught in middle and high school, then by all means take this class. Since I was transferring, I dropped this class. You should too.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I completed all the assignments, tried to get feedback to improve my work (Markwell is vague and inarticulate), attended most classes, and walked out with a B+, having learned very little.

I am an A student and despite meeting with him to discuss how to improve my work, I only pulled off a B+ in his class. He was no help when I met with him.

You write solely on one topic a year, it gets a little redundant but it's helpful to learn different forms of persuasion.

Take it from someone whose first language is not English. I am not a strong writer either and he went out of his way to help me.
