MAKE SURE HE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE! Grades are pretty much based off of participation! If he remembers you when he's grading then you'll most likely get an A. Good class.

Simply turn in all the requirements for the packet at the end, raise your hand a couple times, and if you're still unsure have a chat with him or go on the optional field trip. A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2010<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor. This guy is a genius. I never thought I would question my major choice, but on the first day of class he had me thinking about becoming a lawyer. Walked out of there with goosebumps. Pay attention!! He is sometimes very ambiguous with what he wants. Make sure you think quick too! TAKE HIM.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2010<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor I have ever had at DePaul. He uses a different teaching method which makes you realize how great he is as opposed to other professors.Participate and complete the final packet and you'll get an A. He took many students on a field trip over night to starved rock to visit the 3rd appellate district court. TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2010<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Murray is very knowledgeable. The class is intimidating at first especially for those taking a law class for the first time. There is a lot of homework assigned but everything is turned in a packet at the end of the quarter. Also, he is extremely big on participation. It's 40% of the  grade but if you have him know you're name you're good</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2010<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, great class. She's fun, knows her stuff, and makes in interesting and accessible. The amount of work is absolutely manageable and is more than fair for a 300-level class. She isn't an easy grader, but is very fair. I wish she taught more classes!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend him.  He's intimidating in first class, but turns out to be pretty cool.  A lot of work that gets turned in at end of quarter, but grades fairly.  Only complaint is you have no idea how you're doing in class all quarter till you see your final grade, which might be too late for some.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down, greatest professor I have ever had. He is incredibly knowledgeable about law and most other things. He shares great stories about his experiences and real world examples for everything. It is evident that teaching is truly his passion. Although his class involves a good deal of work, all of it is incredibly useful & meaningful.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2009<br>Class Name: BLS201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best teacher I have ever had at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2009<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An excellent professor with an infectious excitement for a potentially very dry and overwhelming subject. She made it understandable, approachable and relevant. She encourages original thought about Shakespeare even if it is outside the traditional &quot;canon&quot; of Shakespeare criticism. Really fun, funny and hot. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An extremely helpful and interesting professor she is able to turn dull topics into ones filled with debate.

Murray is great and you just need to have him remember you.  MGT 300 requires a lot of outside work, mainly on the Panel presentations.  As long as you do well on those, you'll get an A.  Attend class and participate and that A is yours</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2008<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

Make sure you participate and do not be late! He does not have tons of home wrok, the final was easy and it was a take home and he is an easy grader. If you participate and you come to class you will most likely get an A or B.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2008<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is amazing.  i think she is one of the best teachers that I have had at Depaul.  if you have to take Shakespeare, take her and you wont regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: BLWSECT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You shouldn't take his class if you are either: always tardy or absent, and if you don't like to speak up. He likes people who speak up and ask questions, so do at least some of the readings. He's a really nice person, doesn't make the grading very clear, but easy and you learn a lot more than you realize! Definitely take him for Business Law</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2007<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>amazing... prob. the best professor at depaul. he is soo flipping nice and just wants the best for his students. show up for class and he'll love you.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2007<br>Class Name: BLAW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher. lots of knowledge and truly wants to see each student succeed.

Doesn't teach at all! He has other students go up and teach the class. He shows favoritism, and it's obvious! You will never know where you stand in the class. If you're late once, he will hate you forever and your chances of getting a good grade will fall dramatically! Worst class ever!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We did not go over a great deal of law stuff but the basics, but i thought he was a great teacher.

I am do not really like Shakespeare but she did a very good job of getting into and forcing us to think about the text.  She grades papers on the hard side, but makes up for it with straightforward quizes (with extra credit) and tests.  Overall a very good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2006<br>Class Name: BLW<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Murray chooses discussions over lectures & experience over theory. If you come across the term &quot;easy”, do not fall under the misleading interpretation that u will b enrolled in a kindergarten level course. In fact, it truly indicates that he is indeed capturing and alive. His class felt “easy” because he easily becomes a student’s favorite teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2006<br>Class Name: BLW<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>intimidating at first, but a good teacher. good at what he does and bases your grade on participation. can be mean sometimes and picks on people who dont know the answers. fun and easy class</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: BLW204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Strict, the classroom is his courtroom.
