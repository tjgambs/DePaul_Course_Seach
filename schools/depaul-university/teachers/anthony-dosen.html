He will approach you in class with a response, and along with that, he makes sure that you have an understanding of the theories and how you can apply it to your specific concentration.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2015<br>Class Name: AS801<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Outside of his willingness to explain readings that may not be clear and the fact that he gives you the opportunity to apply the theories to your specific concentration of education, I appreciate him having the cultural competency that made a 1st generation, low income, and underrepresented student me feel like they belong in higher education.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2007<br>Class Name: HST243<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely nice professor, and he's really knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the subject matter.

He never learned anyone's name in the class, which is bizarre and degrading.  He never returned any of our e-mails, which is also incredibly irresponsible and impolite.  He just didn't seem to care at all about the individual students.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2006<br>Class Name: LEAD801<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher....classes are always interesting and thought provoking</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2006<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very, very nice professor, knowledgeble, funny, and pretty easy, definatly take him any chance you get!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2005<br>Class Name: AS498<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fr. Dosen is such a wonderful teacher! In all the classes I've taken with him, I've never found him out of sync with reality. What makes a great teacher is not the manipulation of jaw-breaking words or being a &quot;task master.&quot; It is the ability of the teacher to ensure that learning has taken place that is the essence. Fr. Dosen is a great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: LSE250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy grader, he took off a ton of assignments towards the end. He babysits you through the class. Boring class, but so easy!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
