No notes. Just you and that blue book. (GL) Given you don't have to be in class everyday, you should anyway. Why? You'll need what he says word for word for your midterm and final. He's a tough grader, brace yourselves. If you're unhappy with your scores, learn to be happy with it. He won't change it.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2015<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He is scatterbrained and quirky so his lectures are moderately entertaining. Does a good job explaining what you need to know and moves at a quick pace. Three tests (weeks 4 & 7 and the final) make up your entire grade. You won't pass the tests if you don't go to class and take notes.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2015<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dreadful professor. Rambles on during lectures, doesn't even talk about the material half the time. Hardly writes anything on the board, no powerpoint, and claims that anything he says in class is "fair game for the exam." Avoid at all costs, he is not helpful whatsoever. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2015<br>Class Name: 360<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>This was literally the worst class I have ever taken. He is not at all clear on how he grades and clearly does not care about students or performance. Awful person and professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2015<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Do yourself a favor and just avoid him. The class itself is not bad, but there is no clear grading criteria. The midterm & final are essay questions, which he will only tell you to write as much as you can. Maybe if you can write down every single point he ever said in his lectures you can get an A. I'm a straight A student & received my first B</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2014<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: F</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE!

No homework, no lecture notes, just talks the entire class and does not review for midterm or final. Gets off track with boring stories. Worst professor I have ever taken. Unfair exams, they are each 4 essay questions. So if you miss one essay you already have  a C on your exam. Worst professor- do not take. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Would not recommend. His classes are him just lecturing without giving anyone handouts or material to study. Tests are tough even after reading the chapters. Do not take and avoid at all costs. It is best to wait for a better Econ teacher another quarter than taking him last second like I did. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: 315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY BORING! He talks more about ridiculous issues that have nothing to do with economics. His grading system is highly flawed because there is no clear reason as to why he grades the way he grades. Your grade is only dependent on the midterm and final, which are ridiculously hard. He thinks hes smarter than the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2014<br>Class Name: ECON315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never uses the book. Avoid at all costs, even the cost of a waiting list for another professor. Just a midterm and final which are 3 essay questions. I wrote word for word what he had written on the board from my notes that I studied and still received a C.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2014<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, his tests are hard but this is college and we are supposed to be challenged. I'm in his Micro class right now and he is a genuinely funny and relatable professor. There is no busy work, no homework, no attendance, it's great. I really do enjoy what he has to say (although the subject matter isn't compelling by any means). Don't be scared :-)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Completely lacks enthusiasm, is sarcastic and rude to students in answering questions, barely uses the board, never references the text... Truly a disgrace of a professor. For the love of God, care about what you teach and be passionate about it. Stop condescending and acting like it's some arduous chore for you to instill knowledge.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2014<br>Class Name: 106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst professor I've ever had. I'm a hard worker, and I saw these poor reviews before I took him, but I figured that if I put in the work I'd be fine. Not the case. Incredibly boring lecture, he says tests are straight from the lecture, but they are not. He expects you to have incredible knowledge prior to taking his class. Avoid like plague</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2014<br>Class Name: ECO361<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was by far the worst professor I have ever had. He rambles on and on, and asks trick questions on the midterm and final. I went to his office hours for additional help, and I swear, he hated me for doing that. He's so scatterbrained and confusing and talks at you. I would avoid him. Wait out the term for a better teacher. Terrible.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2013<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not my favorite teacher. Doesn't take attendance but I'd go to class because tests are 100% from the lectures. I got an A and did not use the book once, so I wouldn't waste your money on it. If you take him, make sure you take really good notes -- write down EVERYTHING. Tests aren't bad if you do this.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: ECON361<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is incredibly hard.  If you can learn from lectures without almost no visual aid then this is the class for you.  The book is not really used at all.  If you have difficulty with essay tests avoid this class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take him. He will trick you. The grade is based on 3 non-cumulative exams. The first two are easy are are worth 30 points each. The final, however is worth 40 points and is 10x harder than the first two. If you are forced to take him, buy the book. Don't listen to the people saying you don't have to buy it or else you will bomb the final.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: ECO361<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of Econ students like to hear themselves talk and ask questions that don't pertain to the discussion just to show how knowledgeable they are- Kubik will shut you down if you try to act like a smart ass. Not clear about the structure of papers. Take very detailed notes. Be comprehensive and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2013<br>Class Name: 106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is horrible. DO NOT take him unless you want your GPA to fall. He may be the laziest person ever. He doesn't come to class prepared. All he does is ramble on and on, half of the time he makes no sense. He is also quite rude and if you ask him questions he talks to you like you're an idiot. The class is made up of 3 tests. STAY AWAY.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: ECO360<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a smart guy and definitely knows his stuff, but he's an economist and NOT a professor. He's too lazy to provide homework or quizzes or even textbook readings. He's very helpful if you go to him during office hours, but he just shouldn't be a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIM. PROBABLY THE WROST TEACHER IVE EVER HAD</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2012<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best econ professor at DePaul. Knows his stuff, and is funny/interesting. Listen in class, study notes, you'll get an A. No busy work, which is amazing.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Dr. Kubik's macro econ class. The guy knows his stuff and the class is straight lecture. It's not that he's dry, it's the fact that he has to teach macroeconomics and I think he does a good job of keeping the class' attention by adding quirky commentary to the mix. Tests are STRAIGHT FROM HIS LECTURES. Don't even buy the book.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2011<br>Class Name: ECON104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a lot of the other comments are true, But I have to say I thought the class was awesome. His delivery is dry but his knowledge is spot on.  There are 3 tests (multiple choice & 2 essays) not too hard, but def not easy, no attendance, hw, papers or anything else... I took 104 & 105 from him and they are the SAME, just dif subjects</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: ECON316<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A framing course, using history to buttress economic development. Straight lecture, lots of material, no interaction. Plus: no extra work, no homework, no papers. Take excellent notes. For exams, memorize outlines with key phrases - use his language. Exams are all essays and he doesn't grade on style, just detailed content.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really just a typical Econ teacher. Class is fairly boring, pure lecture and no class involvement. He would randomly ask the class a question and there would just be pure silence.

I learned things from him. He is one though grader though. There is no homework, but you have to take notes, because it is your only guide line for the tests. You must take lost of notes! There are only two essay exams, so if you screw up one badly ? you are in trouble. Class is interesting. He is not the most helpful pro</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2010<br>Class Name: ECO316<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grade based on 2 essay exams, no surprise questions.Grades SUPER hard,must be spot on to get an A.Class really interesting,learned a lot.He responded to my emails with questions about material.One student brought in sample questions and had him look them over to prepare for the exams.

Very tough grader!      Good: Limited out of class work and the book was hardly used.

He is a tough grader but he practically gives you the questions to the exams before you take the exam.  I don't see any of the complainers mentioning that.  He also doesn't use the book at all so don't buy it.  I learned a ton and thought it was a really valuable quarter!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2010<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Always late, not very helpful outside of class.

HE IS USELESS! He is late every class, he did not once bring anything to class with him.  He doesn't know how to teach.  We all pretty much failed the midterm and he said it was because he didn't really teach us the material.  All he talks about is alcohol.  He should be fired.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2009<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an extremely tough grader, and the class is based on two essay exams.

Do not take him.  Gives lectures, you must takes pages of notes for every class.  Final grade is dependent on 3 tests given on his notes.  2nd test is extemely hard.  Does not respond to voice mail or email.  I think he enjoys failing half the class.  AVOID HIM.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is very smart when it comes to economics, but sometimes the best economists are not the best economics teachers.. He is unclear about a lot, he makes up his tests and they are hard, and he tries to do stand up comedy for his students. He loves saying three things: 1. Other things the same, .. 2. With respect to, .. 3. Mmmm.. No.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT RECOMMEND!
