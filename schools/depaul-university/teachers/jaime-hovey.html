This is also a really fun variation is an American Studies course and is largely discussion based. Professor Hovey doesn't like phones in class (it is pretty rude) but she also incorporates activities like live tweeting Dawn of the Dead. One of my favorite professors here. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Although Jaime's lectures are a big scattered and random, History of Marriage was my favorite class I've ever taken at DePaul. She presents controversial subjects in a non-biased manner and helps her students have excellent discussions. Doesn't assign a ton of homework, and what she does assign is extremely easy if you pay attention in class. </div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Jaime. She is a passionate professor that leads awesome discussions. It did take me a while to adjust to her, though. She is extremely random with her teaching method, and at times I could not tell where her lectures were headed. But once you learn to swing with her random lecture styles she is a great teacher! Definitely recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take marriage with her. SO EASY. No test only 10 discussions on D2L, which are easy. Midterm paper and final paper. Some readings and 1 group presentation also very easy & she keeps you interested during class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seems passionate but at times I felt like it was very random. I felt like I did not learn anything from the class. She also is a pretty hard grader so proof reading essays is recommended. It was also frustrating when she didn't clarify how she grades things, making getting A's hard. Not what I expected for an lsp class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good teacher! Knows her stuff! 3 essays and she reviews material before essay assignments.  Totally recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: LSP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutly the best professor i've ever had at DePaul!I dont know what these other students are saying but she has so much passion and will in her teaching. Shes layed back and knows how to relate the material to the indivisual. Great readings, just a heads up make sure you do the readings to be prepared for the paper. overall take her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart but is not passionate about teaching at all. She defiantly used inappropriate language in the class just because she was frustrated. Soph seminar sucks regardless. you aren't going to find a really good teacher.</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
