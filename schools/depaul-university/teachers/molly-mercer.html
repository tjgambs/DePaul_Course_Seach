Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2014<br>Class Name: ACT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I have had at DePaul!

Definitely Recommend!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Mercer is one of the best professors I have had. As a person who did poorly in ACC101, I came to her class with very low confidence. However, her lectures, class notes, and homework were very helpful for me to understand the subject much better. If you don't like  or unconfident about Accounting, I highly recommend her. Nice person too!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: ACT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Mercer is one of the best professors I've had at DePaul!

She has a great personality, is fun, approachable, genuinely friendly, and has a very positive outlook on life.

ACC 101 has a bad rep, but you have a way better chance of passing with her as your prof!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2010<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really great teacher. I had no interest in accounting before taking this class, but came out with a good understanding of it. Her teaching style is very easy to understand and very easy to follow. However - don't be fooled - her tests are hard so even if you think you don't have to study a lot - YOU DO!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a well prepared teacher who hands out excellent notes each class, which are critical for her exams. That being said, her exams are very difficult.  Great teacher, but don't be fooled by a take home exam and being able to bring some notes to class on the final.  Its no joke.  Hint: Don't miss class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2010<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a nice teacher, but very unresponsive. She sped past important points in several units.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Mercer loves accounting and is great at teaching it. She is extremely helpful and a great asset for De Paul. The one warning I would give is to study hard because her tests are extremely challenging. She makes Accounting seem simple but if you don't practice it the tests are killer.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>my fav teacher at depaaul. she makes accounting so easy. explains it so that everyone understands it. plus shes super nice and sweet. she gives out candy on review sessions b4 midterm/final. didnt even need the book, her notes were good enough</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its not easy but she explains everything super well.

Best professor I've ever had.  Accounting is a VERY hard subject, but she somehow makes it clear and interesting.  I thought this class was going to be boring, but it turned out to be my favorite class.  I understood topics MUCH better than my friends who had a different prof.  I wish she taught 102!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2010<br>Class Name: ECO500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lot of passion for teaching.
