Explains things clearly and reinforces learning with in-class homework you can complete with classmate and professor assistance. Midterm is a take home (that doesn't mean it's easy!). Final was challenging but not impossible. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2014<br>Class Name: ACT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I have had at DePaul! Accounting has always been a hard subject for me, but with her teaching it I actually enjoyed and understood everything. She is super helpful and as long as you study you can ace the midterm and final. She also curves the exams about 5 points. Definitely Recommend!!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Mercer is one of the best professors I have had. As a person who did poorly in ACC101, I came to her class with very low confidence. However, her lectures, class notes, and homework were very helpful for me to understand the subject much better. If you don't like  or unconfident about Accounting, I highly recommend her. Nice person too!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: ACT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Mercer is one of the best professors I've had at DePaul! The midterm seemed a little more challenging but both it and the final are very passable. Got a C+ on midterm and an A on the final. She's very helpful and kind. The book isn't needed at all. Loved her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lamborghini Mercer, I think you should take her!

She has a great personality, is fun, approachable, genuinely friendly, and has a very positive outlook on life. She is not easy but the note packets that she hands out during every class are easy to follow and are broken down so that the material can be understood.  One of my favorite professors at DePaul! Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a sweetheart. She is very energetic and enthusiastic. She is the best Accounting teacher hands down and I suggest you take as many of the courses she teaches. You will not regret it. (She is not hot though).</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!

She is helpful, modest, flexible, and really understands what she is teaching. Her handouts are amazing and more than enough to get an A. The final exam was hard, but if you study the handouts and work with her in the class, you will get an A. just go with her and you'll appreciate that.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2012<br>Class Name: ACT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is fantastic. Firm handle on all the concepts covered in the class, and her lectures are lively and engaging.

The topics were relatively interesting and she was able to tie to real world examples.  Molly's grading, homework assignments and tests were all fair.  Not your avg professor! ;-)</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2012<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very energetic professor. Talks fast, sometimes rambles. Knows material very well, sometimes has difficultly explaining concepts. Take-home midterm, hard tests. No outside homework, but studying is a must.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2012<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's the most upbeat professor I've had...

Like this teacher</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2011<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher. She is very thorough and clear. Textbook not really needed, but going to class is CRUCIAL. You get all the experience you need in class through exercises. Exercises are easy, but exams can be tough if you don't study effectively.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is very hard, but the professor is very very nice.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2011<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had this class last year.  Class was hard but learned a lot.  IMO, Mercer is the best prof in the MBA program.  VERY smart and, unlike some of my other profs, conveys info clearly.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers Ive had. She explains materials really well. Will go out of her way to help you if you dont understand something. Hands out printouts for class so you dont really need to buy the book. Take this professor, you wont regret it! Mercer is awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Mercer is by far one of the best teachers here at DePaul. Accounting is tough, but she does her best to get you through it. She is very helpful and wants her students to learn. Definetley take her!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a great accounting teacher! She is very helpful inside and outside of class. Homework is handouts and she gives you enough time to finish. I didnt even buy the book/the CD. Attendance not mandatory but its stupid not to go. TAKE MERCER &lt;3</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Book is not really required because of the awesome notes she provides for the class (She even prints them out for you!). I also feel bad for anyone who is criticizing her. Just go talk to her during her office hours, she'll actually do some one-on-one tutoring. You can't afford to make the mistake of not taking her. 10/10 people!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>by far the best accounting professor. actualy teaches unlike other professors for accounting. gives u candy and if ur smart u will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Mercer is by far the best accounting teacher! She prints out notes for you every chapter, which i made copies of for all my friends with other profs. She will take the time to go over everything until you understand! ACC 101 has a bad rep, but you have a way better chance of passing with her as your prof!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2010<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really great teacher. I had no interest in accounting before taking this class, but came out with a good understanding of it. Her teaching style is very easy to understand and very easy to follow. However - don't be fooled - her tests are hard so even if you think you don't have to study a lot - YOU DO!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a well prepared teacher who hands out excellent notes each class, which are critical for her exams. That being said, her exams are very difficult.  Great teacher, but don't be fooled by a take home exam and being able to bring some notes to class on the final.  Its no joke.  Hint: Don't miss class.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2010<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a nice teacher, but very unresponsive.

She is extremely helpful and a great asset for De Paul. The one warning I would give is to study hard because her tests are extremely challenging. She makes Accounting seem simple but if you don't practice it the tests are killer.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>my fav teacher at depaaul. she makes accounting so easy. explains it so that everyone understands it. plus shes super nice and sweet. she gives out candy on review sessions b4 midterm/final. didnt even need the book, her notes were good enough</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its not easy but she explains everything super well.

Best professor I've ever had.  Accounting is a VERY hard subject, but she somehow makes it clear and interesting.  I thought this class was going to be boring, but it turned out to be my favorite class.  I understood topics MUCH better than my friends who had a different prof.  I wish she taught 102!</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2010<br>Class Name: ECO500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lot of passion for teaching.
