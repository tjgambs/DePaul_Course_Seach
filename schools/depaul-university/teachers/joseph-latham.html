If you don't care, you can get by easily without reading; however, I read and the assignments are bears. Aside from that I learned a lot. He is a stickler for grammar and the only thing that bugged me about him was his tangent foreign policy remarks that were down right insulting. This didn't occur often.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2013<br>Class Name: LAT113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Latham took the time to make sure the class understood what we were learning. If you put in the work, which was very little, you did well.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2013<br>Class Name: MOL210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Latham is passionate about what he teaches, and can answer any question in detail. Easy work load...just do the readings and short hw assignment and you will get an A. Got a 99% on the midterm.</div></div></div><div id="container" class="review"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2013<br>Class Name: MOL210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sooooo easy!! He repeats things a lot but I got a 99% on the midterm and I really didn't study that hard for the test. There is a homework assignment every class but you could copy everything out of the book. Super easy class!!</div></div></div></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: 1%;">Ratings and reviews credited to <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com" target="_blank">Rate My Professors</a></div><div class="center ital" style="padding-top: .5%;">Contact the <a href="mailto:mocksched@gmail.com?subject=MockSched">Developer</a></div></body></html>
