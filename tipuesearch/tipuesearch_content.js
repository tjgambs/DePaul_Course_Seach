{"title":"HC 233 CHRISTIANITIES: ANCIENT, MODERN, GLOBAL","text":"A close reading of the New Testament reveals a diversity of beliefs and practices that developed when people of different cultures accepted the preaching of early Christian missionaries. The engagement of later Christian communities with an even greater variety of cultures has contributed to the spread of various ideas, practices, and institutions--religious and secular--to many parts of the world. Meanwhile, local and regional expressions of Christianity reflect the influence of the cultures with which they have interacted. This course will identify some of these varied expressions of Christianity and will explore the development of modern culture both as a consequence of, and a reaction to, the dominant role of Christian beliefs and practices in many European cultures. We will also consider the impact of the rejection of modern values by some believers, which has led to profound divisions within many Christian denominations. The course will investigate how Western Christianity may have contributed to the various cultural phenomena that are associated with globalization. At the same time, we will also address the criticisms of globalization by many Christians and communities of Christians throughout the world.

For example, narrative and narrative performance are increasingly being used as part of medical curriculum, as a means to train health care professionals to understand the experiences of their patients, encourage deep listening, and foster different professional-patient relations. For cancer, HIV/AIDS, and other patients, performance becomes a means of speaking into mainstream and dominant discourses of health and to actively shape discourses from their own subjectivities. This increases the visibility of health care experiences in their gendered, sexualized, and racialized dimensions. Finally, narrative and narrative performance offers an additional means of visibility in catalyzing change in public, legislative, scholarly and relational arenas.","tags":"Class Status, 0.0, Location, 5:45 PM, Class Section, 9:00 PM, Teacher Last Name, Class End Time, Class Start Time, 25966, Loop Campus, Teacher First Name, Monday, William, 4, 201, Days, Baglia, Class Number, Overall Rating, Credit Hours, Open","url": "classes/HTHC-525-NARRATIVES-IN-HEALTH-CARE.html"},

Learning about how myth is variously interpreted (as for example by means of theories of myth-interpretation) as well as basic methods of literary criticism (e.g., analysis of language, content, structure, etc.), students will employ ways to identify, understand and interpret the different types of communication present in myth-literature. As they move chronologically through the ancient world students will observe how myths change to reflect differing individual and collective concerns, as well as the specific interests (and so the significant aspects of discourse) of authors and audiences as conditions change. Students will also learn about literary genres, including poetry, tragedy and prose, their properties and distinctions and discover how genres also reflect audiences and times. Students will read and evaluate modern views of myth in order to understand how myth is open to multiple interpretations and upon what sounder bases myth is to be interpreted.

They will learn the components of epic language, in particular, literary devices and structural features (e.g., formulas, nested stories, epic similes). They will be able to describe the plots of the three epics and know the main- and mid-level human characters, gods, and goddesses. They will be able to define and better understand the meanings of hero and heroism. Students will be able to express mature appreciation for the epics as whole works. Learning how the epics are variously interpreted as well as basic methods of literary criticism (e.g., analysis of language, content, structure, etc.), students will employ these as ways to understand and interpret the poems. As they read, learn and evaluate modern views of the epics, students will also acquire better means to distinguish critically between views and interpretations. A strong emphasis in this class will be upon the vital connections between past and present, and how students can become more aware of and understand important lasting concepts such as heroism, leadership, self-definition, etc. Finally, students will relate these stories to modern story-telling in order to understand how the heroes of the ancient Greeks live with us today. In short, they will interpret what epic poetry offered ancient listeners and what it has to teach modern readers. The classical tradition is rich with meaning and significance, even to modern 21st century adults and this class will not only be an exploration of the culture and instruction of the ancient world through epic, but an investigation of what classic motifs remain with us today.","tags":"Lincoln Park Campus, Class Status, 0.0, Monday, Wednesday, Location, Gutierrez, Class Section, Teacher Last Name, Class End Time, Class Start Time, Teacher First Name, 11:20 AM, 4, 12:50 PM, 201, Michael, Days, 21137, Class Number, Overall Rating, Credit Hours, Open","url": "classes/MOL-211-ANCIENT-GREEK-AND-ROMAN-EPIC.html"},

We are, in fact, dependent for survival upon climatic conditions remaining within certain rather narrow ranges of the possible variation.

Climate stability over the last 4,500 years has permitted us to invent cities and engage in agriculture and hydraulic engineering, science, and many other activities which we recognize as civilized and like to think of as advances.  However, in an extremely short period of time, only two centuries, we have reached a stage of interaction with the climate which jeopardizes the very regularities in climate on which we depend. In order to understand what our options are we must learn to understand the climate system within large interacting frameworks of geography, geology, chemistry, physics, and ecology over long spans of time.  This level of complexity urgently calls on us humans for an exploration of a robust Earth-oriented ethic.

A significant component in this relationship is the concept of performance and what that entails.  We speak of high-performance cars and trucks, we applaud and then discuss, blog, and tweet (sometimes to an extraordinary degree) the performances of both athletes and actors, we talk about academic performance, we see performing seals, dolphins, and whales at Shedd Aquarium, a member of the clergy performs a wedding ceremony, and the list continues.  A highly contested term, performance is bound to the team role as it relates to sports, theatre, and everyday life. What is your role on the team?  What role were you cast in?  What is your role in the company?  The team role is aligned with function and also with the context in which the role is played.More than anything perhaps, both sports and theatre deal with highly charged relationships.  In the plays that we will examine in the course, it is the sport itself that serves as both the context of and trigger for the relationships that are created, strengthened, weakened, or in the worst-case scenarios, totally shattered.","tags":"Lincoln Park Campus, Class Status, 0.0, Location, Class Section, Teacher Last Name, Class End Time, Class Start Time, Teacher First Name, 25426, 4, 201, Louis, Days, Tuesday, Thursday, 4:10 PM, Class Number, Overall Rating, Contey, Credit Hours, 2:40 PM, Open","url": "classes/THE-215-PLAYS-ABOUT-SPORTS.html"},
