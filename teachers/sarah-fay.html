While we spent a lot of time being doofy and watching some YouTube clips, she always taught the lesson well and if the time ran out and she thought there might be any confusion, she sent a follow up e-mail. More than willing to meet outside of office hours if you can't make them and overall an awesome, but quirky gal</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2015<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Fay is definitely a professor that you MUST take. She is sweet, funny, and so enthusiastic. Everything that she presents in class is clear, important, and a means to an end. There are no pointless assignments and she shows you that if your professor is good, it should be easy to succeed. I would highly recommend her- she is funny and smart!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2014<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Fay is easily my favorite professor because she genuinely cares about her students and their well-being. She's an amazing teacher and listener, and is really funny too. She tells it like it is and gives back great constructive criticism. If you have the opportunity to take any of her classes, DO IT. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: ENG484<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Fay was an amazing teacher. Highly engaging, smart, fun, and was one class I never wanted to leave, despite getting out at 9:15. Very constructive on her notes and respectful, too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2014<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely loved Dr. Fay's class! She is always really helpful, and makes workshopping writing into a fun and painless experience - all constructive criticism. If you like to write, want feedback, and want to have fun all at once, her class is for you. To get the best class experience, GO! It's worth it.</div></div></div></body></html>
