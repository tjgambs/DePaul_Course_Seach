She copies the book directly onto powerpoint and then reads from it--even though you have to read it for homework the night before! Is a little condescending to students and would rather think the worst of them. Her tests are also based on stupid factiods rather than what you've actually learned. Never again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2005<br>Class Name: ADOLESCENTSEX<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken Thara twice and she has yet to let me down.  She has great command of the class as well as the material.  I recommend her, especially her adolescent psych. class.  A great help in & out of the classroom.

Her lectures can get a little on the dull side, as she reads directly from the Powerpoints, but the content is interesting.  Don't plan on getting out early, though...she'll try to keep you till the last minute.  Other than that, just read and you'll do fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken two classes with Thara, and they were both awesome.  Her lectures give you a ton of interesting information, and you have to work, but you can definitely get an A in her class.  Also. lots of opportunities for extra credit-always a plus!!  She's one of the best instructors at Depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the second class I have taken with Prof. Thara and it was even better than the first one. She is extremely understanding and is always willing to help. Take her if you really want to get your $s worth at DePaul because you will learn so much in her class!
