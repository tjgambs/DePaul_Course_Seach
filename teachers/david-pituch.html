He is a former musician, so he knows what he is talking about.  He likes to talk a lot during movies(there are plenty).  Isn't a stickler for attendance.  He gives you the questions for the midterm and final essays, and he gives you practice tests with questions straight from the tests.  One term paper which is graded easily.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2008<br>Class Name: MUSIC100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is horrible. all he does is ramble on about his early days in music. doesnt teach anything valuable and puts things on midterm that he never discussed. Avoid him if you can. he is insanely boring and a waste of time!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2008<br>Class Name: MUS101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Pituchs class was very interesting, definately learned a lot. He is very intellegent and passionate about music. Would recommend this class to anyone. Take Pituch.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2008<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the nicest teachers at DePaul, very helpful has midterm,final, one 5 page essay, and weekly online quzzies which you can take as many times as you want.  Midterm little hard other then that TAKE THIS PROFESSOR easy CLASS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2008<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BORING. Made me not even want to go to class. There is something due almost every single day. Stay on top of your homework if you take him. Try to take advantage of every point you can possibly get because the midterm and finals will be the death of you</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2008<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel bad for the man.  He is so passionate about what he teachers, but nobody seems to care or pay attention.  The class itself is very interesting, and one the whole, easy.  Six page paper is pretty open to anything, but study for those exams, and do the blackboard homework.  He also is an outstanding musician, and very knowledgeable.  Take Him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE TRIES REALLY HARD TO MAKE THE CLASS INTERETING BUT MOST OF HIS STUDENTS DONT CARE. ATTENDENCE IS MANDATORY COUNTS AS PTS AND MISSING ALOT OF CLASS CAN HARM UR OVERALL GRADE. 6 PAGE PAPER IS EASY CUZ YOU CAN CHOOSE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO WRITE ABOUT. EXAMS ARE A LITTLE CHALLENGING. DEF NEED TO STUDY FOR THEM. NOT BAD FOR A TEACHER AND CLASS TAKE IT</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2008<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not that easy. Midterms and finals are hard. Reasearch paper is easy, but chekcs it very hard. Laughs at his own jokes. Very very very boring. The quizes are very easy, can take multiple times from blackboard. Sometimes does not know what is going on in his class. I would not recommand him for arts electives.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He laughs at his own jokes, soft spoken, very intelligent and understanding guy, but sooo monotonous and boring!!! First half of the quarter is full of dry stuff, then second half gets a bit better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay I don't know about these ratings....this guy is definitely not that easy.  The midterm and final were way too hard for an introductory class.  He's a nice guy and all, but he requires you to know dozens of composers and pieces for the exams.  Decent, not great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him!! He's an awesome teacher and very helpful. Work isn't too crazy just a big paper and a very easy midterm and final. He tends to be boring but its worth getting an easy A from him. He makes a topic not very interesting bearable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2005<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor!  Very amusing and flexible as far as homework deadlines.  Although some of the lectures seem boring you still learn alot without much putting forth much effort.  Just make sure you do the quizes, they are very EZ when you figure out the system</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun prof.
