She makes class so cute by providing fun activities to make learning fun. The class size is small. It is mostly an open discussion with her and the class with out tables forming a circle. We watch movie clips. She is very lenient on due dates. She is very supportive of her students by reassuring and complimenting them. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2011<br>Class Name: ECE91<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice and helpful.

Everytime she explained an assignment she would confuse herself and all of the students.  She was constantly late to class.  She was rarely prepared.  The last two classes contained lectures that should have been covered the first week!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2008<br>Class Name: ECE092<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2008<br>Class Name: ECE091<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor has knowledge about subject area.

This is NOT A LECTURE CLASS. It is hands on and you will have to do 3 presentations to demonstrate that you know how to do artistic, musical, and dramatic activities for kids. Pretty simple.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2006<br>Class Name: ECE286<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher was so disorganized! She gives you three presentations in the beginning and never taught us anything. All the classes were spent watching everyone's elses presentations. I want  my money back!! Try to avoid her if you can.</div></div></div></body></html>
