She has a true passion for humanity and loves to instill that passion in others. She is more than willing to talk one on one and gives great feed back. She doesnt give away A's, you have to work for it but if you ask for help she will. Lots of reading but, this is college!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2015<br>Class Name: INTC301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>This was by far the worst class I have ever taken throughout my college career. Each week there is a ton of work, the lectures are unbearably monotone, & there are a ton of readings that hardly relate to the lectures at all. The only musiccultures you discuss are from the upper peninsula of Michigan and Brazil. She is a harsh grader & not helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: INTC301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i took this class with my roommate and wow was it a mistake. worse class i've ever taken at depaul. the professor is no help, the quizzes are impossible, and you have to do a million discussion posts. worst of all is the material covered which has to do with brazil and the people of the UP of michigan, it's literally awful. don't take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2015<br>Class Name: INTC301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>This was the worst class I have taken at DePaul. I thought the class was going to be about music and we ended up focusing on Brazil and the U.P. as cultures as a whole. Quizzes were impossible and her guidelines were VERY unclear. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2015<br>Class Name: INTC301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class online and there was ALOT of work. On top of the weekly readings, discussions, lectures, links etc, there was a quiz (which only gives you 15 minutes). The average scores are nearly failing but nothing has been done to give students feedback or more time. Hard grading and lack of clarity about assignments. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>You must read, she gives pop quizzes. Group project, with not a lot of direction. Give your opinions and be able to back them and she will like you. Pretty easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2014<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Not impressed at all by this professor. Yes, she is nice, but unnecessarily tough. Her quizzes do not always reflect what we are learning in the class, and she is not very clear on what she wants in her papers. Take her if you have no other option for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2013<br>Class Name: CMNS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is an amazing instructor -- she elevates the discussion and shared knowledge. She is tough but fair, and improves you infinitely. If you have an opportunity to take ANY class with her, you must!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2012<br>Class Name: JTERM1<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>On of several professors that made me who I am today (DePaul grad of '91 here).

I am taking her again for Senior Capstone! I highly recommend her. If you have the opportunity to learn from her, consider yourself lucky! She is so cultured and well-spoken that she inspires you to be a better person. Class is based on discussing the pdfs so come prepared and you will do fine! She is amazing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really a great professor, because her lectures were quite interesting and she got me more interested in communications. However, she is kind of a harsh grader when it comes to writing-related assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barbara is a wonderful, interesting person, but this class was difficult because I had never done anything like discourse analysis before.  I rate low only because it was such a hard topic, but she is a wonderful teacher and I learned a lot! I would definitely recommend her for CMNS 310</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class always seemed to drag on.  She knows the material very well but I just didn't find it to be very interesting. Claims her exams are extremely hard but they aren't bad at all. Lots of reading required weekly and comprehension quizzes. Also journal activities due twice a month.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2009<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fair and nice, just sort of uninspiring.

I was really intimidated by her at first. I blew a major assignment but she met with me regularly to find ways to make up for it she was very understanding. She definatly made me a better writer. Keep up with readings!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2009<br>Class Name: CMNS307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Speicher is a good teacher and she makes lectures interesting. The readings in the course are interesting and not too thick. She grades essays easily and doesn't assign very much work. Take her classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2007<br>Class Name: CMN305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A little intimidating, mainly because she's the department chair. Exams are demanding, but you should be okay if you've done the readings and attended class discussions. It might also help you if you're a communications major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: CMN305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very smart. The textbook is dense but you don't even really need to read it, she explains it very well during class. Her midterm/final reviews are exactly the same as the test she hands out, so you know exactly what to study. Just read her articles that she posts and write her questions and you'll be just fine. She can also be pretty funny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2006<br>Class Name: GRAMMARUSAGE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Considering how boring the subject matter was, she made the class pretty fun and is an incredibly nice and helpful person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: COMM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a****</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be Prepared.

She is very knowlegeable of the subject matter, returns tests and papers quickly,and is available a lot outside of class; but the class was very challenging, with lots of dry material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: 226<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2004<br>Class Name: CMN202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very picky on writing assignments, demands clarification, dislikes generalizations.

A LOT of dense reading every night, a 20+ page paper and 2 very detailed exams. Also, she had a complex system for grading our participation, would take note of EVERY time each student spoke & assign a point value to each comment based on its &quot;substance&quot;.</div></div></div></body></html>
