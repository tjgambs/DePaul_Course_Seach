    She is a very sweet woman and cares about her students success. It was her first time teaching 101 so I tried to cut her some slack but she was just okay. I think she will get better with time. But she is willing to meet with you any time!

    She's repetitive. "Easy" class if you read the ENTIRE 40pg/class articles-Expects you to know small details. Doesn't get to the point until the last 10mins of class. Picks on certain people. The course itself is okay, but her sources are not reliable. Participation points. Course was about race&ethnicity; but she added sociology and literature.

    Awful class. She makes no sense half the time but treats you like you're the idiot.

    Good professor, cares a lot about her students. This class required a lot of reading, writing, and class participation (including online discussion postings), but we did learn a lot about Race &amp; Ethnicity. Class was demanding at times with a large load of work but course objectives were met.
