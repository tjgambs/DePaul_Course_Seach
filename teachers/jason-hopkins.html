Had a lot of fun. His lectures include a lot of videos that are extremely entertaining. I would take his class again. The lectures are easy to want to participate in. He gives good examples. Grades on effort and criteria not on artistic ability. Gives help when needed. It's a great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2014<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Rather not say</div><div id="right"><div>It was fun but you definitely need to work hard in order to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Every week has projects and I stayed up every time when I did the assignment with my friend. Show your projects in class. Final project is very important. If you do not do well in your final project, you will get a low grade, even though you spend a lot time to do.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is a narcissist. He has you do assignments all term, gives you a grade on them, but then does not calculate them into your final grade. All he cares about is your final. He makes rude comments on students work. He wants you to spend excessive time creating the final project. If you take this you won't have time to even eat. Awful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2013<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hopkins is a really nice teacher who has a lot of interesting material.  He isn't too hard on any of the assignments except for the final so be prepared.  While he isnt that hard animation is still a very long process but the hard work will pay off since I ended up getting an A in the class! Just make time for the class and you'll do fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: ANI100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this class with him unless you have the time to complete the assignments, this class should not be ANI for non majors, it felt like I was taking a 300 level course. Professor is very knowledgeable, has great information to share with students but wouldn't recommend unless you are  really passionate about animation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2013<br>Class Name: ANT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class involves more work than it should. It's fun to learn about animation, but he ends up expecting a lot from you. Projects take up an enormous amount of time if your not great with After Effects. Pretty decent class though, I learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2013<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SUPER HELPFUL! you do not event need to know how to draw. He will help you from scratch, lets students re-do assignments for better grades. PLUS: Super Hot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXCELLENT teacher. Definitely the most interesting man I've ever met, is always saying something ridiculously interesting, shows a ton of cool animations in class, and teaches the skills necessary to complete the work. If you do the work you get full credit, and fulfilling the criteria is very easy. Would take this class every quarter forever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2012<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's super great! Explains everything clearly and doesn't have wild expectations for students who aren't artists or animators. He also shows very interesting shorts in class. I recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2012<br>Class Name: ANI206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An awesome teacher that explains everything in class well, and repeatedly ties in key ideas in class discussions. The homework is also relatively easy as long as you at least try. Also, he is the most well-dressed person in the entire school.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2012<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Liked Him. He's a chill laid-back prof. Do his work and you should be good, though I had project each week not so great if you have a heavy workload because they can take a while even if they're easy. AND great eye candy while learning! :D</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2012<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher. Great class. Take it! Just turn in the assignments and show up to class and you'll get an A. It's animation though, so it is time consuming...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2012<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Animation for non-majors was super easy with him! As long as you tried, attend the class and have SOMETHING to submit every week, then you'll get an easy A. He explains things well and is pretty great. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A LOT OF FUN! even if u take this class because its a core requirement ur still gunna love it!

Knowledgeable, easy-going, vibrant, and passionate about animation.  I've learned more in his class than any other, hands down.  Its just too bad he doesn't teach more classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/17/2008<br>Class Name: ANI102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher ever and plus he is hot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2008<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jason made the class a bunch of fun! If you have little experience with Photoshop and Aftereffects he helps you with your skills for the final project. Just take some time to work on each assignment, it will help when final project comes around. I recommend taking for sure!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2008<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jason is great! He really has a passion for the topic and makes this class fun and interesting- which helps for students who are NON-animation or even CTI-related majors. Fun class, watch a lot of cartoons/animations.. mini animation movie as final project.{Recommended}</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2008<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was easy going, fun at times, an enthusiastic funny professor. The in class tutorials were a bit confusing but if you pay attention youll be fine, also very helpfull if you ask about an unclear concept.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: DC378<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He deffinately knows animation and the tools as well (after effects and photoshop). He does expect you to comprehend things that may be new to you quickly. Other than that he is an excellent teacher and he is good looking!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2006<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this teacher is too sweet for the eyes...matched with such a hot, well-rounded personality...he would make an excellent date.  however, he is one helluva tough teacher!! very kind and willing to help but he makes the stuff look soooooo easy but when u actually try to do it...it can take ages--literally.  and for an INTRO class, he requires A LOT</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2006<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pro's: Very creative, funny, easy going, enthusiastic.  Knows ani software/techniques very well and has a well established background, some of his work has been on Adult Swim.  Cons: Doesn't really know how to teach.  Has problems conveying concepts to inexperienced students, and tends to rush through important parts.  willing to help if you askhim</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2006<br>Class Name: ANI200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for 3D modeling for animation and gaming, it is now called ANI230. He is very artistic in the fact that he is not precise and kind of jumbles things to look the way he wants them. He teaches modeling/rigging/skinning/Auto-mapping UV's/lighting/rendering/AfterEffects. He's a funny laid back young teacher, so its good times!</div></div></div></body></html>
