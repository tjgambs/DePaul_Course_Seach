Do the readings and attend class and you will be fine. This class is an easy B..a tough A but it's possible. You need to be a good writer. I'd suggest showing him your paper before turning it in. The class is all discussion and it was interesting hearing several points of view. One of the best professors at DPU.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2011<br>Class Name: AMS250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, cool teacher, class is pretty interesting. Readings are ok but...DO NOT TAKE CLASS IF YOU AREN'T A GOOD WRITER/ANALYZER. Review is not for all students. I ended up with a c+ while busting my a** off on papers.

He is very helpful and most importantly he makes the class interesting and worth coming to. Other than analyzing a few essays, there are also a few quizzes on some of the readings assigned. After the quiz he goes over the readings to make sure you understood them. I would take him again if I could!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2007<br>Class Name: AMS150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very helpful and explains things well. papers need to be very analytical but other than that class is pretty easy and it is very interesting. definitely a great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2007<br>Class Name: AMS150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was hard, but it was interesting.

His classes are always fun and his assignments are usually pretty interesting and he is a fair grader if you put in the effort.

This class was the biggest lamest waste of my time.
