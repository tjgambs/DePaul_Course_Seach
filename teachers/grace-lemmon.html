Group projects are  you pick an episode of the Office and answer 3 questions about it. The homework is a  random article she'll put on D2L weekly and you just answer and submit them via D2L. I wish I could take her for all my management classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2015<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor at DePaul. She likes to relate to students on a personal level and gives great examples. Class is not too difficult. There is a group project, weekly assingnments which she gives you time during class to do, and two online exams. Simply put: Grace Lemmon is bae. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2015<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes a boring subject interesting.

Her lectures are highly interactive, intellectually stimulating, and extremely practical.  She is highly intelligent and entertaining.  You can apply what you learn in her class to work the next day.  I will definitely take her again, if possible. She's Uh-Mazing!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2014<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grace was a great instructor. She had a true passion for the subject, and when a student asked a question she did not know the answer to, she would write it down and have an answer prepared for the following class. Great knowledge for the subject, would highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2014<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Go to class and get all participation points.

Shes pretty cute to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher.  No exams, just 3 essays and a group project (read a case study and answer questions).  Topics are often relevant to the working world.  Participation is 20% of your grade.  Class was an easy A overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2014<br>Class Name: MGT360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Two exams and a project. Study guides provided. gives extra credit and doesn't require textbook - everything you need to know is in her powerpoint lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an excellent professor. Only 3 exams and a final project. Gives study guides and has review days before each test, all MC and TF. No book needed. She lets you out of class early to skip elevator rush. She's really nice, easy A, easy grader, great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2013<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is about theories and application. The lectures cover theories and practical uses. There's no textbook. The readings are a collection of online articles and handouts. They give "real-life" examples of situations where you'd need to use the different theories. The coursework is made up of 3 or 4 papers and one that's group or individual.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor overall! 3 tests, 1 group or individual final project (really easy). Attendance is not mandatory but she usually let us out early. Bring your laptop, take notes on the powerpoint. Come to class, she might ask you to turn in class questions for participation. Do the study guide, you'll do well in the tests. Don't buy the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grace is a great professor. She really cares about her students and wants us to succeed. The material may not be the most interesting but she makes the class go by quickly. I recommend her 100%, one of my favorite teachers at DePaul. In a business school its easy to get lost but Grace takes the time to get to know her students</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you attend the lectures, take good notes and read the text and case studies, you should do well on writing the papers, which is what your grade is based on (no tests).  She even lets you turn in papers early and sends it back with feedback that you can use to get a better grade.  Great teacher and really cares about the students!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2013<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.
