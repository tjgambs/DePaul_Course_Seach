She is extremely knowledgeable and really knows how to teach. Organized and crystal clear about what she expects. I never missed one single class of her just because her informative and interesting lecture is one thing that I never want to miss out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: HAA216<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got an A- in this class but I had to work really hard for it. The midterm and final were very difficult in that we had to memorize "thirty facts" of two art pieces, with ten pieces being possibilities. Lillehoj was very nice and I did learn a lot, however this class took up most of my time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: HAA216<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor ever! Love her and want to take all of her courses. She knows everything! She even wrote many books, you can check it out on the library site. Take her class! She is so cool when she explains everything that students ask. Easy A, knowledgable professor, informative lecture, and more you can expect. Must take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: HAA247<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures can be very boring at first, with very little discussion. But after a while, it was OK. She is very helpful and willing to explain anything. Her midterm and final are so easy. She basically gives you exactly what is on it the class before. What more can you ask for&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2011<br>Class Name: HAA220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not an easy class -- the midterm and final were killer (mostly the essays). She is a fine professor but often seems annoyed if someone asks any question at all during the lecture. Only take this class if you're ready to put a lot of work into it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2011<br>Class Name: HAA217<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher easy exams</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2010<br>Class Name: HAA397<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was a really hard class.

Her classes aren't easy, but nothing worthwhile should be in my opinion. A wealth of knowledge and EXTREMELY helpful in whatever endeavor you approach her with. Great guest speakers and field trips. Professors like her make me really glad I chose DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2010<br>Class Name: HAA216<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>History of Japanese Art Class; was amazing and informative. Class grade is based on two papers and midterm and final. Midterm and final are easy, she pratically gives you the information you need for the tests. Papers aren't bad either. You learn a lot and she is always willing to help. MUST TAKE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2009<br>Class Name: HAA220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice lady and helps you if you need.

Loved the class. Easy A. She really wants the students to be interested and do good. Two 2-3 pg papers, 3 &quot;quizes&quot; (tests) where you write 2 short essays. No need to read the long articles (usually 30-50 pgs). Impossible to not get an A. A nice change from the other honors courses.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: ART250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class, boring lectures. Essays on the Final were stupid because only true art majors would understand them. She has has to chill out with her questions and realize not everyone loves art as much as she does. Easy A though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2007<br>Class Name: ART250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst lectures EVER. slideshow fest. you dont have to go to class, she gives answers to essay questions on review day b4 test. she grades exams easy, but hard on the paper. make your flashcards and memorize that crap</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: ART242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the best speaker, but knows a lot of interesting information. Is a fairly easy grader.

You can see she is nervous. She tries really hard. Not particulary the best teacher but good enough for an art teacher. No she doesnt have ADD. Youd be nervous too talking for 1 hour and half about art to 50 students. Take her. Easy grader too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: ART242<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2005<br>Class Name: ART242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lillehoj is a cool lady.
