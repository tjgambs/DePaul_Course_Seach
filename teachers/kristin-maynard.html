The material is not EASY, however she makes the course EASY by making learning fun & interesting, and by being CLEAR about exactly what she expects from you as a student. She is inspiring and is extremely organized. It would be difficult to fail this class if you pay attention & turn in work on time. &she's cute!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2014<br>Class Name: ORGC251<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Kristin is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.

She is super friendly and approachable. The class material is really interesting and all of the work is straightforward and very manageable. She even helped me get a great internship which was an added bonus! She's awesome and so is the class so I encourage everyone to take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: ORG251<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kristin is an amazing teacher.  I would recommend if you have to take ORG 251 you take it with Kristin.  Her lectures are very simple, she posts the outlines on D2L and there's only 1 major writing assignment.  Do the readings and participate in class and you'll be fine.</div></div></div></body></html>
