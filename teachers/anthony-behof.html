I suggest making friends with him because I should have definately failed this class, because I didn't complete any problems on the final, nor pass the midterm, but I was constantly in his office asking for help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: PHY110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. B. was excellent to take a class with.  Although the material was challenging at some points, he was always willing to help students understand.  The take-home reviews he gave us for our tests were nearly identical to the tests, and he was very good about extensions with homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2005<br>Class Name: PHY110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an extremely nice guy and very helpful in class. he makes a very challenging course seem quite easy.

QR is not fun stuff but it has nothing to do with the professor.  He is very helpful and understanding.  He let me turn in late work without a penalty.  Take him for QR, he doesn't make it any worse than it has to be.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2004<br>Class Name: PHY270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An absolutely brilliant man, he sometimes takes things too fast or in unexpected directions.  He's always helpful, however.  If you take his class keep in mind you must WORK and READ and TALK to him outside of class.</div></div></div></body></html>
