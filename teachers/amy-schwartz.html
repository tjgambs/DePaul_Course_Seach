    Amy is a very understanding professor and she'll work with you to make sure you actually learn something in the class. Her assignments aren't too ridiculous, but she'll work with you if you're struggling. She's very laid-back and relaxed, and she usually finishes class early. Would definitely take her again!

    Amy only teaches a couple classes here, but she is by far once of the worst professors I've ever had. She is rude to her students, in the way she addresses them with a lack of respect, and she doesn't respond to emails until right before the next class. She's very unprofessional, and her instructions are usually ambiguous. Never again.
