I took her Major Authors class on Virginia Woolf and she helped with research and every step through the final paper. Open to helping students all the time on anything. Super fantastic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: ENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have had ten years or more to formulate my opinion of Ms. Cameron. She was my professor in Saskatoon.  She was the worst professor I ever had in my university career. Nothing more to be said.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2012<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved her Writing about Literature class! Very enjoyable and educational. She's very organized, knows her stuff, picks interesting material to study, and makes you a better writer!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2012<br>Class Name: A1<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had her as a prof in Saskatoon in 2002  and i feel vindicated. She sounds to be just as useless now as she was then.  The worst prof i ever had. Totally inadequate as a teacher. Should have been a librarian.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2010<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>loved this class! she is a great teacher and always is willing to help if you just ask. also is very understanding when situations arise. would def recommend her. however there is a lot of reading in her classes and expect pop quizzes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2010<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this class.  Rebecca is very nice, helpful, and understanding.  She does a lot of lecturing with PowerPoint presentations, but it's not as boring as it sounds.  And she likes to encourage class discussions.  She's straightforward about her expectations.  Midterms and finals are pretty much the typical English format.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2010<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her laughing drove me so nuts that I could not pay any attention to class discussions. Good intentions and super sweet but not good and enforcing rules and acts uncomfortable interacting with students. Tougher then she comes out to be. Gives quizes on the longer novels.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: ENG383<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cameron is sweet, enthusiastic about her subject matter, and has great taste in literature. Yes, there are a lot of (interesting) readings -- but you're in college now, babe, so suck it up and buckle down. She's a harder grader than you might expect beneath the easygoing exterior, so put some effort into those papers, but she's available to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: ENG359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I fell asleep everyday in this class. Prof. Cameron has a poor choice in literature and expects you to read two 200 page novels a week. Frankly, I think she makes a lot of stuff up to kill time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2008<br>Class Name: ENG359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class is pretty much pointless and contains the same vague pseudo-feminist rhetoric we all heard before.  What one must be wary of is her underlying scrutinying nature. Somewhat new to DePaul, the big bright lights of the city still dazzle and intimidate her so beware if you embody somethng thats outside of her insular sphere of influence.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2008<br>Class Name: ENG227<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor!! I never thought I would ever be as interested in Drama as I am now since taking her class. The workload is very managable and her assignments are crystal clear. She grades fairly and cares a lot about helping students improve their work if needed. I will definately be taking another class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2008<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cameron completely sucks! Her lectures are monotone and boring...attendence is mandatory and she usually gives quizzes after reading a book...although the materials were quite interesting...she doesn't allow the time to even enjoy them...drags class to the last minute and sometimes over...DO NOT TAKE her for night class! Tough grader!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2007<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED this class. she is very clear and organized and overall a great professor. Speak up as much as you can, and read the text and your set.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: ENG379<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken this teacher for 2 classes because she has a good choice in literature.  Everything i read with her I enjoyed.  She's not the most interesting but she sure knows how to put on a powerpoint discussion!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: ENG379<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken this teacher for 2 classes because she has a good choice in literature.

She needs to learn how to be a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: LIT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i fell asleep. everyday. enough said.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2006<br>Class Name: ENG471<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While Dr. Cameron is a nice lady, she needs a little more growth and direction as a professor. I felt like the work was tedious, and that she was nervous. At times, I felt like the class was juggling three different assignments at once. While ENG 471 is a graduate requirement, in retrospect I would have taken this class with another professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: ENG270<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If nervous laughter makes you nervous, shy away from prof. cameron. Otherwise, she's very helpful, and has some good insights. Work load is enough to make you think, but not overwhelming. plus you gotta love canadians.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take her. She is very enthusiastic and is an overall great person. She actually cares about her student's input on things, and doesn't automatically disregard people's opinions. My only criticism is that the first half of the class you do NOTHING and then the second 1/2 after midterms, you get all of the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2005<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2005<br>Class Name: ENG459<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Undergrad students beware: do not attempt grad school if you don't want to read.  She had to lecture to you because there was apparently no class discussion as a result of ignorance surrounding the texts.  She was terrific in our class- new at DePaul but very informed on her subject & super nice.  She's a very good prof now & will only get better!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want an easy class take any course with her. I've been in 2 of her classes. Both had short papers and easy finals. The one final was practically a take home. The best part is: SHE HAS NO ATTENDANCE POLICY!! I probably only went to 10 classes all quarter and still managed a 'B'.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Cameron is new to DePaul, and was a little nervous at the start of class, but quickly got more confident. She is a sweet lady, passionate about literature, and fair grader. Also, very willing to give extra help after class or during office hours. Plus, a cute Canadian accent, what's nottolike&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2005<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Uninspiring. She smiles nervously while she's lecturing, which is very distracting. Took the nite class-a mistake-because I found her boring. Other than that, the class is pretty easy, though I think she's a tough grader. two papers: 3pg & 10pg, in class assn. & final essay exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Those who are complaining, I presume, have never had a truly 'bad' teacher, b/c Prof Cameron is far from that. True, the classes may not have been the most stimulating, but they weren't that bad. If you show up and do the minimal readings, you're fine. A little bit of effort goes a long way, people.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am no idiot,nor am I a slacker.I actually like to think of myself as a very hardworking student; this was by far one of the worse teachers i've ever had. I learned nothing from her! i had to drop her class because I couldn't even stay awake in her class.

You write 3 papers and shes so unclear with what she wants you to do. I dreaded going to the class, it was so boring. She lectures about the stories you read and that is it.

She is very unclear as to what the papers as supposed to be about and if you dont write about what she wants you get a bad grade.

She has a real passion for what she does and enjoys having discussions with her students. She's a very happy person. Very bubbly. She's a very fair grader. Her discussions keep you interested. I'm definitely going to take a class of hers again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2004<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One or two very short readings every day.  The 3 papers were pretty easy.

SOOO Cute though, she's kinda nervous in front of the class,and its funny.  But she's a really good teacher, and the readings are short and fun.  3 or 4 pretty easy papers. I'd have her as a teacher again.</div></div></div></body></html>
