Sometimes his crazy demeanor is distracting but mostly he drives me crazy.

He doesn't make attendance mandatory, but with the way he rode me, there's no need for that. I longed to come. To class. Mainly to see Dr. Pepper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: PSY305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a great professor! May take some time to get used to his curly hair and lisp, but he definitely knows how get his class motivated by any means... Especially if you come in for one on one help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2012<br>Class Name: PSY101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Once you get over his strange accents and tendency to refer to scotch and brandy, you will see that Dr. Pepper is truly a gifted man in every way. He filled me with passion. About the subject. I would recommend this class for anyone wanting to explore the subject on a more intimate level.</div></div></div></body></html>
