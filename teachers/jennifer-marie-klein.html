We didn't have any tests or quizzes but we did have a couple power points and 2 long papers. She's an easy grader and gives you an A as long as you fulfill her requirements. Lectures are boring but she's so nice and you will definitely learn a lot! Recommended :)!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2008<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Klein is a good teacher.  Light work and pretty easy class to get an A in</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2007<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes a really nice teacher and I'd recommend taking the class. The only thing is she reads her class lectures straight out of the text book so it sounds like she dosen't know what shes talking about half the time so class can get really borning really fast. There isn't much written homework either-just a lot of reading assigments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2007<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best! Attendance is not mandatory, there's one midterm and final, mostly multiple choice questions. the best thing is that she gives you the exact questions that you need to study. Also there's a 3-4 page paper. Super easy. Take her, she's great!</div></div></div></body></html>
