    Find a good group because this class is all about playing some simulation game with them which is basically worth the majority of your points. You can't get a grade lower than B- in the simulation though. He is a very nice guy but this subject was boring. You can play another simulation game by yourself instead of taking the final too.

    Most of the class is the simulation which costs $50 to sign up. The lowest grade you can get on this is B-. The exam on the simulation is crazy hard but he curves. Lots of extra credit. There is a simulation that you can do at the end of the quarter to replace to final. The book is not necessary but you might need it if you take the final exam.

    Easy A for anybody...D on simulation, B on midterm, As on attendance &amp; peer evals, B on presentation, and C- on final (from doing the extra credit)...got an A- overall.  It's no where near difficult.  do the best you can and if you put in the effort, you'll learn to apply all classes taken prior to a business setting.

    If you go to his office to ask for help, he will make u feel like u r bothering him. Had to call tech support to have them teach me the simulation. He is useless! Good class with a diff prof. The simulation is worthe 80% of ur grade and is HARD!

    I took the full quarter GSB 599 with Belohlav. He was a great teacher. The simulation was awesome. Pick a good group. He usually lectures for the first 1/2 of class and then you do the simulation for the 2nd half. Do not have to take final (there is an intro test - easy). There is a presentation too (unless you win). Great class. Learned a lot!

    Does not teach you anything useful for the simulation game, which counts for 80% of your grade ! Do not buy the textbook, it has no purpose in this classroom.

    If you want to spend your tuition on playing a game...go right ahead!! (the game is not easy!)We played the game for about 6-7 weeks, he lectured like 3-4 times. If you are in the winning team, your lucky! If not, prepare to do some extra work to boost your grade.

    Dont buy the small txtbook. you wont need it at all. Even if u + ur team did bad on Capstone, there are other categories u can raise ur grade up. Lectures are boring but sign in because attendence pts will help a lot towards the end. Not a hard class.

    Boring class. Easy A. 84% is an A. The class is based off a game, and if your team screws up then your grades will as well. His lectures are boring but you can leave anytime, just go there and sign in because attendance is mandatory and are easy points.

    Giving this guy 5 for helpfulness&#63; Give me a break! He's not that helpful. He spends too much time talking about stuff we already know from other business classes or stuff that would be of little use to you during the game. He should focus on the SIMULATION! I am disappointed. i would not take another class with him.

    This guy is horrible!  Do not take him.  He has no interest what so ever in his students, and even if your grade is .0001 from a B+ or A-, forget it your not going to get it.  This guys is HORRIBLE!!!!

    A great class to take. Very knowledgeable man. (this is an actual student writing, not the Prof) He gives interesting facts.There is a huge group project due so pick your teammates carefully or else your screwed and show up to every class. Tests are not hard, this guy is just really nice to talk to and listen to. Laid back type of class.

    This is a Must take class!!!  The class itself is not that hard.  Just make sure you show up because attendance does count or have someone sign in for you.  You do not need the book.  I got a A- without really trying this quarter...

    Class was a lot of fun, but choose your group wisely because you might get stuck doing all the work. And go to class; I missed 2 and my grade was affected...or just have someone sign you in (theres a sign in sheet every class).

    The class is a complete joke; you sit around and bicker amonst your groupmates and strategize your future failure within the simulation, then he quizes you on nonsense. You fail EVERYTHING in the class and end-up with an A. Another worthwhile senior level course...Dr.B is terrific, that's about it.

    He is a really easy professor. There is no real work to do in the class. Just show up once in a while. The grading system is FREAKING retarded though. But deffinatly more Pros then Cons. Take the class.

    I did nothing! Nothing at all during class! You don't even have to come! Its impossible to get less than a B! If I actually came and took the 'optional final' I could have gotten an A! A must take!

    Finally, a class where DePaul integrates student know-how into real decision-making process. You'll find yourself lost with his oversized syllabus before the first Capstone decision, but once you get a feel for the class you'll have a great time. Prof. B is nice, kinda strange, but all around great.

    Very easy class.  The assignments are simple and if you follow the instructions you will do well on them.  The Capstone exam is simple if you read the book, which you will need to do to play the game.  More that 1/3rd of classes is spent on playing Capstone (great time).  The teacher is very nice.

    The grading in the class is kind of confusing.  The Capstone Exam is easy and the Final Exam is optional if you want to get an A.  I was bored but this class is good if you want to pad your GPA.

    Capstone is interesting, but quite fun. However, the class itself is extremely boring and draging. He explains alot about the grading and doesn't really expand on the capstone project. The capstone exam is easy, but the class is very slow

    This professor spends way too much time explaining his grading criteria as opposed to explaining what the class is about.  Asking him a question is like asking a politician one, he never gives a clear straightforward answer to the question you ask.
