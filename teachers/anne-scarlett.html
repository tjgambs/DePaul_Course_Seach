I took Public Speaking as a communication elective, but what I didn't realize is that I would learn to become a better student in all of my classes. There are definitely strict deadlines, and participation is important, but that is all necessary in a public speaking class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2014<br>Class Name: INTC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my favorite course last quarter! I especially valued Anne’s grading feedback. Her encouraging tips and honest constructive comments were on point. Even though it was a three-hour night course, time never dragged.  She really kept things moving! I would definitely take another course with this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid her at all costs. Not only is this class a waste of time due to the high amount of work to be completed, but Anne is one of the rudest and most inconsiderate professors I have ever dealt with at Depaul. AVOID AVOID AVOID</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>The class is pretty hard and very time consuming, but I left feeling like I had learned the most out of any class I've taken. She is very clear and organized in every regard. I would definitely recommend this class as long as you are willing to work hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anne gave me some of the most valuable feedback I have received at DePaul (especially her constructive comments on the Interview project). Even though this wasn't a 'speech' class, I learned a lot about public speaking. I also loved the hybrid format! The final project (actually the whole class) was very time consuming, but worth it. Recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: INTC220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's high energy and enthusiastic, but treats everyone like they're maybe three years old. Not deliberate condescension, but it grates nevertheless. The class itself is fast paced, but manageable if you're willing to devote time to it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class Fall2013 and I was intimidated when I first saw D2L, there was ALOT information. The hardest thing I had with this class was I got cinfues on ALL the deadlines, there seemed to be soemthing due everyday. Other than that, she is awesome! She really cares about her students and she wants you to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: INTC220402<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Anne's class in Fall12. I'm really using what I learned! I found her to be warm and intense(about turning us into better communicators). If you want a good grade, then go to all classes, participate,  DO the work. She's not an easy grader; she's fair and gives valuable feedback. And I got to know my peers well, thanks to her teaching style</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2013<br>Class Name: INTC220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a great attitude. Very enthusiastic about the topic! If you do what she asks you the class will be easy. If you procrastinate you won't be so lucky. Definitely learned a lot from this class. Prepares you efficiently for real world speaking experiences. Seems intimidating, but she has a great heart and is willing to learn from you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2013<br>Class Name: INTC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have a hard time saying I learned a lot from this class. Yes, she was knowledgeable and informative, but she was uptight and not very personable, which made it hard to feel connected to the material. Her policies are extreme, and to be honest.. she kind of seemed like a high school teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: INTC220402<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What helped me most was Scarlett’s enthusiasm for the subject. I admit, I was a bit taken aback the first day because of her energy. But her energy kept our class interested. She knows what she’s talking about and that motivated ALL of us to do our best. Honestly, this class made me a better communicator overall! FYI,attendance policy is hardcore.</div></div></div></body></html>
