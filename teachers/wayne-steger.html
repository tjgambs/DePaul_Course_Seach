Steger! Disregard the comment below. I had A's all across, and you know what....I barely did any of the readings until I needed to, and I had the older edition of the books. If you listen in class, and do the MOST important readings, and really spend a lot of time on your midterm/final you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2010<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Way too much work for a 200 level class. All 3 tests required reading 500 pages from various books and answering very vague questions, yet somehow he wanted very particular answers.

He knows how to present the material.

He's extremely knowledgable on an impressive number of subjects, yet he is easily approachable and very understanding with his students. Perhaps a bit unorganized - but so long as you read the material, speak your mind and put some effort into your papers, expect a good grade!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2009<br>Class Name: PSC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of, if not the best professor I had in college.  Cared about me more than any other professor, saved my butt more than once.  The claim that you need to take the left wing position is nonsense, I am a conservative Republican and spoke my mind.  He is VERY intelligent, and sees through BS like water, so you have to think and apply yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I worked my butt off for this class and I got a C--my first C in college. He messed up my GPA. His grading is impossible and it is true...he only likes extremely left wing democrats. He picks and chooses students as his favorites. Class discussion isn't required but he makes everyone feel tense. Don't take him for political science. Enough said.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Steger is an incredible professor.  He is the reason I declared my major to political science.  In order to do well, engaging in discussions is critical and reading the text.  The multiple choice and final on his midterms came straight from the text but the essays came from class discussions.  Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2007<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor!!!  He is really helpful with his and other classes.  If you need anything you can go to his office and he is more than willing to help.  I would tell anyone to take his class, if you don't you are missing one of depaul's best.  He is not a really easy grader, but if you go to the lectures and read just a little, you will do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class and professor are Awesome!

He's a straight up politics junkie and is incredibly knowledgable and engrossing. I had him for Congress. He could be a little pompous sometimes, but he knows enough to get away with it. The class was very much worth, highly recommended. SHOW UP EVERYDAY. I stayed after class frantically writing trying to remember everything often</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2007<br>Class Name: PSC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Steger knows his stuff, and runs a pretty fun class.

Expect to make inferences and not only memorize, but try to go a step further. Make sure to participate in class now and then. Otherwise, the lectures are really interesting, but he talks a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great professor and very knowledgable. He encourages class participation and sometimes randomly calls on people. The tests are not at all easy. His multiple choice is very complex. The class isn't an easy A. It's very hard but interesting. Tough grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2006<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does not encourage class discussion.

I'm not a political junkie and I got a really good grade.  If you go to class and listen to the lecture and take notes you'll be fine.  I never read unless I had to.  Studying for his tests are really hard but the test itself was not that bad.  Awesome guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2006<br>Class Name: PSC300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wayne is one of the best profs in the department!

If you do the readings, you will do well.   If you don't do them, you will fail. If you want to be challenged and to actually learn something, take this prof.

He grades fairly on the papers but then grades extremely harshly on the final exam, so what you think you're going to get probable won't be the case. He puts too much weight on participation (doesn't leave you too much room to talk) and common hour.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2005<br>Class Name: PSC222<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knowledgeable professor, extremely hard class.

Also, watch out if u are an ed major he has something against us. Basically, he thinks that ed majors have it too easy.
