She is good at helping you out of class. She does take a lot of this really in depth, which can be a bit annoying if you aren't actually looking to be a technical communicator.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class. She's an easy grader. There are 3 projects (very simple) and the final is just putting them all together. online quizzes are multiple choice. you have to take it until you score a 100 or she wont except it. I highly recommender her, she nice</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2012<br>Class Name: WRD301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its a 2 credit class but the amount of work she puts on the students is almost like its a 4 credit class. Shes a very tough grader on assignments, and there isn't much opportunity to make up your grade. I would avoid taking her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: WRD301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, but you learn a lot. She is not demanding which is great! She also understands that we have a lot of other things going on so her assignments and quizzes are reasonable. There are reading assignments, but you can get away with never reading any of them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2011<br>Class Name: WRD301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher very helpful.
