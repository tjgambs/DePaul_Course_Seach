Makes the class exciting for his students, gives clear grading criteria. Weekly reflections, one quiz and a final paper. He is very helpful and appreciates student participation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chris is an awesome guy! Prob one of the easier lab classes you can take. No exams or tests, just 2 simple quizzes! Bi-weekly lab write ups (also easy) and one final paper on a topic of your choosing. Readings can be a bit tedious. There is a field trip to Field Museum the final week of class. He is very funny! He loves Marvel Superheroes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2015<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>I had somewhat of an interest in archaeology to start but he really did make it much more engaging with his enthusiasm and tangential anecdotes about adventuring through Peru and other exotic sites. He lectures the dry material with a palatable sense of self-awareness and comic relief, and really does want everyone to enjoy the class and get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2015<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>attendance was semi-mandatory as one would expect from a lecture based no-textbook course. Miss four lectures and fail but that is a common policy throughout most learning domain courses at DPU and obviously most courses outside of core natural sciences do not lend to non-attendance and self-teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2014<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly recommend taking this class for scientific inquiry - lab requirement. During the lecture, he gives a lecture with PowerPoint presentation, during the lab, you do a "lab" (most of the labs are paperwork). You will have (only) four paper assignments based on labs, two quizzes on lectures, and one final paper. He is an easy grader also.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2014<br>Class Name: 103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor full of energy. Archaeology is his life and makes it extremely interesting. Readings are slightly tedious but overall great professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2014<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor and class. I recommend taking him, definitely! He is very passionate about archeology and is always prepared. It is mostly PowerPoint lectures, but he likes getting people involved. Do most of the readings and show up and there's no reason not to get an A. Good guy and good class.</div></div></div></body></html>
