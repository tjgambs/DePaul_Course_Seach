I hope I can take more classes of his.  He is really one of the nicest professors I have had here, but he is also very helpful.  I feel that my writing has really improved after taking this class. It is probably the single most effective creative writing class I've taken at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2011<br>Class Name: BIBLE284<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice guy, and is very encouraging. I am sad that I wasn't able to enjoy this class as much as other people. His quizzes are tough, fill in the blank/ finish the quote type questions. Very detail-oriented. I'm not the best at remembering details from lecture, but if I were I would have done well. If you are, you will too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2010<br>Class Name: ENG284<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jones is amazing! He is passionate and knowledgeable about what he is teaching. He is very approachable and understanding. I look forward to this class every week. There are 4 papers, that aren't graded, and a final exam. Take his class if you get the chance - I couldn't say enough wonderful things about him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2009<br>Class Name: ENG284<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Jones is a nice guy.  Loves what he is teaching, and keeps you interested.Tends to go off on tangents, but not boring.4 papers(but not graded), and a final - only book you need is the Bible.  Very enjoyable class, however only bad part is attendance is mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: ENG284<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took Bible as Lit over the summer. The Bible is the only book you need. I have no interest in the Bible at all, and he made it interesting. He is super nice, wants everyone to do well, offered e.c. to help you raise your grade. Read, write the papers, and do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2008<br>Class Name: ENG284<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was an awesome professor who loves loves the subject. The bible was the only book you needed for the class and it wasn't that hard. Just a few quizzes and a final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2008<br>Class Name: ENG284<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a December class & 3+ hours Monday through Thursday sucks Hes a really nice prof and you can tell he loves poetry and he defiantly knows what hes talking about BUT he has favorites and tends to ramble on(but the ramble has meaning to it) this wasn't the best class of my life but I've had way worse Read & do hwk. & listen and youll get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: ENG284<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a wonderful class, and a wonderful professor. Prof Jones is just about the cutest, sweetest guy ever with a great passion for poetry and the Bible. It is not taught as a theology class, but as LITERATURE. Take this class, especially if you have any interest in reading and interpreting the Gospels.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: ENG284<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the Bible as Literature and I expected the BIBLE AS LITERATURE. But it was just a theology class that incorporated &quot;poetic understanding&quot; He shouldn't be teaching this class: you only read the New Testament, he doesn't let students talk, no discussion about mythology or folklore and he acts like teaching this class is his mission work to God</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2008<br>Class Name: ENG284<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nicest guy I've ever had as a teacher.  Took the summer session of his class.  He made it as interesting as a 9:00am summer class can be.  Rambles a bit at times, but its fine, its interesting rambling.  Also, he had the grade submitted the day after the final.  Gotta love professors like that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2008<br>Class Name: ENG284<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great and caring professor. He always tried to keep the class attentive. We talked about the 4 Gospels throughout the 10 week period and watched a movie the last week before finals. The only textbook we had was the BIBLE! Interesting class if you care about poetry or learning more about the bible! I recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2007<br>Class Name: ENG284<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for a 3 hr afternoon class and he tried his best to keep everyone interested. Attendence is mandatory. Plus there is a test every week based off of the readings which are not that hard as long as you read everything and pay attention in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2007<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great professor!

This prof truly loves his class and keeps the class interested throughout the entire 3 hours on talking about he Gospels. Reading are short and few, quizzes can be difficult on each gospel but simple at the same time. One page due each class as journals, final just essays. Loved it & his caring personality.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2006<br>Class Name: ENG284<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He plays favortism by calling first on the students he likes rather than people who have had there hands raised for like 5 min.  I have observed him practice this rude treatment to several students. How can you receive participation credit if he doesn't call on you even if you have your hand raised before his favorites he will call on them first.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2005<br>Class Name: ADVPOETRYWKSP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Richard is the reason I decided to pursue poetry.  His passion, his grace, and his encouragement gave me reason to believe that I could do such a thing.  A tremendous poet and an even better person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: BIBLEASLIT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He wasn't my favorite professor at DePaul but definately a good one.  I had a night class with him and while it dragged sometimes he made it easier.  Tells a lot of jokes that ARE funny and encourages the class a lot.  Weekly response papers & quizzes that arent that bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2005<br>Class Name: BIBLEASLIT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Having this professor in this course was amazing.

His class was SOOOO boring, he played favorites, and he didn't explain anything. If you questioned something he was unclear about, he got mad. I say, avoid him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: ART200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What an amazing experience.

He truly loves the art, and this comes through in the discussions that evolve during the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2004<br>Class Name: ENG219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher.

He's always been an awesome teacher, but ever since he's started providing more solid feedback on our poems, he is one of the greatest professors I've had the honor to learn from.
