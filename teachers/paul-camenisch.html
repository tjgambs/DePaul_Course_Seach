Can totally hold his own when it comes to religion classes.  He's just a sweet old-style southerner in cityslicker's clothing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, lots of books, demands the readings to be done. If you don' read, don't come to class, you will totally be lost. Medium grader, not really hard if you include lots of info - he basically tells you everything in class. I would take his class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor. Demanding workload consisting of eight books, four papers, and six posts on blackboard. If you do the readings and participate in class, you will do well. Intelligent and interesting professor, well worth taking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you participate in class and do the readings, you'll do pretty well on the papers.  Understanding the readings is near impossible and his explanation of the readings are unclear.  I drove myself insane trying to figure out what he was looking for on the papers.  I suggest taking someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2004<br>Class Name: RELIGION<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hmm, he's a bit boring, and he really does like to hear himself speak...and he's FRIGGING OBSESSED WITH DILLARD....but he's cool, and very knowledgable. Over all I'd recommend him, because he is retiring, but there is something to learn from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really great guy! His class is a little bit difficult, don't take him if you're not going to put effort into the class... if you do, you will gain a lot knowledge and it won't be boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! Wonderful lectures. You need to take good notes and study, but his exams really are not hard (since he gives you all of the possible questions). Glad I took him. He is retiring soon, so take him while you can! Great professor!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2004<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher.  Really one of the best I've had at DePaul.  Way nice.  Pretty funny.  Boring at times but its not like the subject is that great to begin with.  Not really easy but he is helpful and with a little effort you can get an easy A/B</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just remember everything he says...take good notes, hes a very nice & understanding guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2004<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great guy but at times he is unclear.

I liked how he seemed to be exploring each book(7 total!) with us instead of lecturing. Good book selection overall; introduced me to author Annie Dilla</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a cool teacher. Readings can be boring but he is a very intelligent and interesting man.  Very helpful and not really homework you just have to be caught up on the readings and there is a lot of readings and only one paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2004<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely difficult, wants to hear himself throughout your papers, but an amazingly intellegent man.  hardest class i have taken yet, but also the most interesting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2004<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared for the world &quot;according to Camenisch&quot;.

If you take good notes, you will do fine in his class. I got a 95% on his midterm (he gave us the exact study guide). He will also help you out a lot on your papers and he is funny and interesting.
