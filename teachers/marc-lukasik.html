This is the second time I took him and would take again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marc is cool and clearly passionate about what he's teaching. However he holds the students to higher, graduate-level expectations. This is especially true with APA style papers. No matter what I turned in I consistently did poor on the paper sections, despite being a strong writer. The quiz and test questions came directly from the book too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like Professor L a lot! He takes topics that aren't the most fun & makes them interesting. He's friendly + was very willing to meet for extra help, which really does go a long way. I wasn't sure what to expect going in but in the end I did learn a lot. Overall, a helpful class to have taken, & I recommend for people who are going into psychology.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2013<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lukasik is one of the younger instructors I've had - a knowledgeable and down to earth guy, definitely very attractive too. He expects a lot, his class is definitely NOT a blowoff class. There's mandatory attendance & a group project. I'm not normally a 'group person' but did like the project, just would have helped to have better teammates.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2013<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the worst class and worst professor I've ever had at DePaul.  His lectures are pointless.  He just loves to hear himself talk and is completely condescending when any questions are asked, not to mention he has no clear answers.  This class is A LOT of work.  Take it with someone else who won't waste your time and enrage you at the same time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2013<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great professor. learned a lot, helped refreshed my stats background writing with APA style.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2012<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>take his class if you like to be a robot and take in information without thinking about what you are taking in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2012<br>Class Name: STATS1<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good instructor. Helps explain complicated material in a way that makes sense. Takes attendance and had homework most weeks, but wasn't too much work to do. Exam study guides helped a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2012<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is honestly not bad as others make him seem. He's a fair grader, doesn't give much homework, he cares about his students and he gives a detailed study guide for every exam. His lectures are BORING and if you can take someone else who is better do it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2011<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel that every class there was either a quiz or some sort of paper. In the end, I am happy with the research project and he gave us a lot of materials which I will use in the future but this class was absolutely miserable. I read out of class and got a B- in the class. He was really great about emails but the class was miz!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2011<br>Class Name: PSYCH241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this professor and recommend him.  Class was enjoyable overall.  Research project was valuable, especially the lab sessions using spss.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2011<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's arrogant and downright condescending at times. It's like he is trying to fail you. Not helpful at all. The entire course was draining from start to finish, would never recommend. Plus, his lectures seem as if he just likes to hear the sound of his own voice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2011<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this teacher is a jerk. hes a know it all and doesnt really come off as if he wants you to learn. id say if possible definitely take someone else- he makes the class pretty miserable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2011<br>Class Name: PSY381<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor was engaging throughout class and made topics like personnel and HR interesting.  Learned a lot.  Tests are straightforward and not too difficult and not that much homework is assigned.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice guy who knows what he is talking about. He's also young so he doesn't talk down to you. He never ends class early, and mine was a 3 hour 15 minute class. The only thing I didn't like was the way his TA graded. She constantly made mistakes and entered grades wrong, but hopefully she wont be his TA again. Overall a good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2011<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher is really nice and friendly guy. Does a good job getting through lectures with activities and discussion.  Gives class time to work on group projects in class.  Helped me with my understanding of stats (not usually my strongpoint).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2011<br>Class Name: PSYPSY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this teacher is ridiculous. the class is super boring and he's a know it all. i have learned absolutely nothing from his class. his class has made me hate research methods even more than before. do not take his class! he's rude and not helpful at all!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2010<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>take Prof Lukasik he will walk you through how to write in APA style with a term paper and makes time to meet with students in person.  he is fast with communication and has an upbeat personality.  enjoyed his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Lukasik is an overall good instructor. He goes over what is expected so no surprises. Lectures are not bad and group activities are incorporated into the mix. Has a midterm and final + term paper but the paper is written in steps so it isn't all at once. Takes attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2010<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marc is new at teaching and his lectures show it-BORING. He tells you exactly what is required of you so there are no surprises. However, it's hard to stay awake during lectures-he's constantly searching for ideas that he doesn't have. There is a group project that you should expect to teach yourself how to do because he is less than helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2009<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIM.  He is unorganized and doesn't offer any real help with questions.  He is not very smart and doesn't prepare for the lectures, so he hums and haws throughout most of the lecture.  You won't learn what you need for research methods II.</div></div></div></body></html>
