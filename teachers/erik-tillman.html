Two essays and 2 revisions are 80% of the grade. 10% participation and 10% Pop quizzes and class activities, which are easy. Grades normally but can be picky. Take him if you enough the content he's a nice professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2015<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class to pay attention to because it's something you will actually use later in life.

He is not clear in what he wants nor feedback for you to do better. He is boring, as well as doesn't do extra to help you. If his office hours do not match your schedule, sucks for you. If your assignment isn't in the format he wants, sucks for you. If it's late, sucks for you. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2014<br>Class Name: PSC390<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard pop quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2014<br>Class Name: PSC250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've never had a good night sleep like I did during this course.....this dude could put a lion to sleep....I highly recommend this course to insomniacs....if you are not out by 5 mins. into his screencasts, I will pay you money, because that would be almost impossible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2013<br>Class Name: PSC250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tillman is easily one of the best professors I've had at DePaul. He's extremely intelligent, keeps class interesting, and relates course material back to current events. His class is not the easiest, there is a copious amount of reading you need to do. But go to his office hours and talk to him about papers/readings he's very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2013<br>Class Name: PSC250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No textbook, which is awesome. And no exams. A couple quizzes, a group project (that's actually kind of fun and unique) and two easy papers. Prof Tillman also makes class pretty interesting by teaching in different ways - debates, political cartoons, film, etc. Glad I took this course with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do NOT take this class with this professor. He assigns so many readings but then fails to test students on those readings and often results to testing students on things that weren't ever discussed in class. His enthusiasm about the topics he teaches are extremely poor, he grades unreasonably, and criticizes your input even when he asks for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: PSC250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic teacher. Both the course as a whole and the individual lectures were super well organized, well thought-out, and insightful. He brings in relevant current events to lectures, too, and is very helpful if you ask for assistance. He's a very nice guy, too, w/a goofy sense of humor. Class isn't easy, but well worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2012<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremeley biased towards students. avoid him completely.He is a complete jerk.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2012<br>Class Name: PSC250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tillman is one of those teachers whose qualifications you question. I'm sure he is an intelligent man, but he lacks initiative in his class. There was a simulation during class, which worked out TERRIBLY. His grading is a bit biased to those who actively participate in class. Just needs to know all students have potential. Stay away!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2011<br>Class Name: PSC340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just want to get him a hotness rating!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2011<br>Class Name: PSC301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tillman is a rock star teacher!! He assigns a lot of readings but if you are into the EU they aren't that bad to read. Grades easy if you know what you are talking about.

He is a really nice guy and is very knowledgeable on his topics. Some heavy readings but mostly a couple of papers & one research only. Extremely helpful to his students</div></div></div></body></html>
