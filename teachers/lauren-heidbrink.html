You can ask her about her day and assume you will hear, "Check the syllabus". She is NOT helpful and her weekly discussion boards are as unclear and miserable as walking through a maze lit on fire. Luckily I didn't sit close to the window, temptation was extremely great. DONT TAKE IT..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2015<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Discover Chicago was great! She's really inspirational and loves the topic of immigrantion. Lecture can sometimes be boring. But she is really nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HELPFUL PROFESSOR, AND INTERESTING COURSE...(MULTICULTURALISM)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prepare yourself for the readings because they are all about immigration and most are extremely depressing.  Overall, the experience was boring but not all that difficult.  She gives a lot of helpful feedback on the essays and encourages students to improve their writing skills.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Basic class but it seemed all the readings and movies were around immigration. Which seems to be a theme in here class. Shes willing to help with any questions. Her power-points are direct and to the point. Your supposed to read the book but never use any of the information. As long as you work hard and show effort you should get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved her! She was sooo, incredibly helpful and gives very detailed feedback. She's also very knowledgable and easy going.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2010<br>Class Name: WORD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Basic WRD 104, attendance taken and is mandatory. The entire quarter class revolves around certain writing topics, for example &quot;American Identity&quot;. Very helpful teacher, but you need to get on her good side right away to distinguish yourself. Following the syllabus and handing in work with effort, on time will get you at least a &quot;b&quot; in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very kind professor, and gives you a lot of feed back on your writings! Really cool person who knows a lot about her subject. Class can feel a little repetitive with the theme about children, but it is a focal point class. She knows how to keep things interesting. We watched a couple really interesting movies too. I recommend taking her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher, really helpful.

However, her class requires A LOT of work, much more than some of my other classes and this was just a first-year program course. The class was a little dull and boring - really easy to fall asleep and she assigns a lot of hard and uninteresting reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>excellent prof. keeps things interesting. great readings and good discussion. lots of writing, but it is a writing class afterall!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>challenging but extremely helpful. really wanted me to understand and to do well. highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TERRIBLE teacher. i don't know what the other people are talking about. she teaches this freshman required writing class as if its a graduate anthropology class.

She really loves her topic and knows a lot about it.  There is no textbook, just two readings for each class.  If you work ahead on the readings it is much better because of hte project.  She is extremely helpful and emails back immediately with responses.  Very enjoyable class, I reccommend it.!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice teacher and is very helpful.  The subject gets rather boring because you only argue about childhoods in different societies, and sometimes it is unclear what you are supposed to even write about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was an okay teacher. A bit boring and she tends to base her class on a theme. I have no interest in the theme of childhood. She's not very helpful when it came to writing and she grades a bit on the hard side. Lots of writing and reading assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was somewhat boring. Teacher is extremely nice though. A lot of work throughout quarter (reading and writing). No final or midterm... just a collection of previous essays. She grades pretty hard on those portfolios though. Overall, if you like writing, I would recommend. If not, don't take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class, boring readings, she's not a bad Prof., quite annoying though, all the assignment were about children and stupid stuff. I hated this class, would not recommend her, would not recommend against though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The teacher is soooo boring but very nice and intellegent. You would expect her to be more fun and exciting because she's young but NOOO! Her assignments actually helped me become a better writer. This class is definitely managable and the readings are interesting. She grades nicely. Don't be scared.</div></div></div></body></html>
