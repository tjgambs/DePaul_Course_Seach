Extremely intelligent, enthusiastic about the material, and very nice.  A lot of reading (but its worth it, and necessary) exams can be difficult but not if you do the reading!  I loved him, would take him over and over again.  I wish all Professors at DePaul were as knowledgeable and excited about the topic...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2006<br>Class Name: MODERNJUDAISM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME Prof. Class is a bit difficult.
