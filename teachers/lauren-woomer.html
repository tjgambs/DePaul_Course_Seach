Her methods are still rusty but if you listen you would leave this class very knowledgeable. There are only two 4 page papers and weekly personal reflections.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Go to class and skim the readings and you will get an A. She's very knowledgeable about what she teaches, and is always willing to clarify things. If you go to class, you get her notes, and the papers basically write themselves. Readings can be tough, but she always explains them in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2014<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Very new to teaching. While she doesn't care if you come to class it will affect about 25% of your grade via quizzes and group discussions. Overall it is an easy A if you show up to class most of the time. 75% of your grade is take home written exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2014<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Lauren is very new to the teaching world. Her notes were well thought out, but the group discussions weren't very useful. The four take-home exams were a piece of cake. I didn't do the readings and got a very easy A from regurgitating the notes on exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Lauren is clearly a new teacher and will benefit from some time in the classroom. Take her courses if you want a class where you can tune out and get an A with minimal effort. She would come to class and waste time by hand writing an outline on the whiteboard from a printed word document. Knows material but did not facilitate discussion well.</div></div></div></body></html>
