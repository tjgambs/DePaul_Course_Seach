I went into this required class without any interest in Medieval Lit and thinking was going to be a complete bore.  I was pleasantly surprised!  She's a great lecturer--never has a 3hr 15min lecture seemed shorter.  I am embarrassed to say I enjoy the readings despite having already taken a personal oath to hate all medieval lit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2006<br>Class Name: ENG390CAPSTON<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She rocks. I was afraid of the material but then she really helped us understand it. She knows it's difficult but wants to help.

The lectures drone on and on. To pass you'll have to do all the reading, but you'll want to kill yourself first. Very nice outside of class and helpful, but Breen teaches the same Eng. classes as her and he's infintely better.

With barely superficial knowledge of the material, she will drag you through her painfully boring and utterly pointless lectures in which she constantly refers to her  amatuerish notes and repeats the most trivial concepts.
