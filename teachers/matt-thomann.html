    Amazing professor who is really into his field. He knows what he's talking about and promotes discussions that are interesting. Regular homework and if you just keep up with the homework it's an easy A.

    Great teacher, he really knew his stuff. Gives major points for attending, its 25% of your grade. Everything you do in the class is based on the readings so if you read you'll do very well.So come to class, read, and enjoy :)

    Prof. Thomann is an amazing professor! As an anthropology student, I felt he truly cared for the subject and cared about what his students got out of every class. Very passionate, experienced cultural anthropologist; take him if you love the subject and want to learn more.

    Matt is a great professor.  I really enjoyed his class.  Although there is a lot of reading, the midterm is easy and all you have to really do is write 3 papers, which are super interesting and fun to write.  He is very knowledgeable and loves his students. Great guy. Take him.

    Take him!! He has definitely been my favorite professor at DePaul, so far. He's super, super nice and helpful and also very knowledgeable in the subject. Do the readings, come to class, and chime in once and a while and you'll be fine.
