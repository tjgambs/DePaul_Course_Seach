He's funny and tells stories to to make a boring subject interesting. I would recommend taking him, he assignes a weekly test on the inclass discussion and the book and a group project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2012<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>William is great! His class is interesting and involving. He gives good examples and tells real-life stories, he helps understand what management is about and how to become a good manager. His tests are ok if you read the book and follow his presentation materials. I would recommend him! He is one of the best teachers!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2012<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2011<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really great guy who has a lot of real world experience in HR. He tells interesting stories too. While the class was half online, the in-class sessions were definitely better. Tests are half from the book and half from class discussions. They are not that tough if you take good notes and read. Bottom line, I would recommend this prof!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2011<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was surprised to like this guy after all the comments I read. We had to do a presentation, which he graded very lenient on and there were a mid term and final exam that were only fairly hard, they came right out of his class lecture/ my notes and the textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brutal!!!!!!!!  Keep Away!!!! Tests are as hard as they get,, C grade is pretty average</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2009<br>Class Name: MNGT500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really personable & gets people interested right away, but beware, don't get too comfortable or question him or he will subjectively change peer reviews. I never felt like I was being tricked on multiple choice tests before-he made it not about learning key material, but picking obscure sentences from nowehere, so demotivating! Save yourself!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very interesting and knows his stuff. I enjoyed class and it is run very well. His tests are very hard and require a lot of memorization and understanding of exactly what he said. If you don't mind a lot of reading and harder tests (that are curved), it is a decent class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is too bad that this guy can not put a reasonable test together.  You must memorize class notes and over 500 pages of text to get an A.  He cares so little about the students that his final exam had questions from chapters that were not part of the coursework.  Unless you feel the need to work too hard for a required course, avoid this joker.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Reasonably good teacher who makes class interesting. Two exams, however, are very picky consisting of multiple choice from book and essay from notes. Result is rote memorization of material as opposed to understanding and application. Group presentation on a given topic every class. Recommend only for those test takers who are good at memorization.</div></div></div></body></html>
