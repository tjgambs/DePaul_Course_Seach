His class really sparked my interest in IT and I learned to love web development. The class was really easy, he drops a couple quiz grades, and an assignment grade, and he offers extra credit. The midterm is crazy easy but the final does require a little studying, nothing major though. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Good guy. Really gauged my interest in information technology. Gives clear-cut instruction for assignments. Must study for quizzes, as well as the midterm and final. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2014<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>This is the first painless math class I've ever taken, and I'm a bad math student! His PowerPoints are online for download and are extremely helpful to review outside of class. Prof also has a MD degree and lots of his class examples are about medicine, which I found engaging. Always available for extra help and a great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took the online version of this class. One thing to mention, keep up and review the videos he has. Like someone else said, format is videos and quizzes. Standard midterm and final, would definitely spend more time than usual studying for these because they are not easy! Other than that a solid professor, would recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This online class was good. Mendelsohn has 2 or 3 8-25 minute lecture videos per module, there's 9 modules. Each lecture has an attached 8-12 question quiz. The midterm counts for 15%, and final for 20%. The quizzes are 20%, and assignments are 45%. There are about 6 assignments. Quizzes are tough, assignments medium, midterm/final easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2013<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have prior Java experience and taking this course.  Finally, A class where the instructor gives brilliant and well organized notes!  It makes learning so much easier and actually fun to do!  I've taken other professors that are nightmares and go on tangents when explaining what needs to be done. He makes learning a lot more straight forward!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2013<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very engaging. Explains well.  Easy to work with.  Wants you to succeed. Helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2012<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class online. I've taken other classes online and they were boring or horrible, but this one was great! He sections the lectures into about 10min each, so you don't die of boredom. The assignments were pretty clear, about 1 a week, and he responds to your questions often in the same day. Best online class I have taken, great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2012<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mendelsohn will lead you about 80% of the way through each of the assignments and will let you Google search/research the rest on your own.  It isn't anything that can't be overcome.  His notes are extremely well written and organized, if you are struggling review the on-line version of these and it will help A TON.  Fun assignments IMO.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2012<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>YOU HAVE TO PASS THE FINAL TO PASS THE CLASS. IF YOU FAIL THE FINAL THAN YOU FAIL THE CLASS AUTOMATICALLY.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2012<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class was pretty easy, he's narcissistic and ALWAYS thinks he's right. He likes things his way and only his way.  Still ended up with an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2012<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For an intro web programming he did a great job explaining all the concepts.  Never had to take notes.  Assignments are very easy and final was a cinch.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Challenging, but very helpful.  Really tries to ensure everyone's learning, without being patronizing.  Very fair and reasonable.  You'll enjoy his class, but you will work.  Brings a lot of different perspectives to his teaching (he's also an MD, very active, etc -- not typical &quot;ivory tower&quot; approach, refreshing.)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2011<br>Class Name: JAVA901<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good explaniation of examples during lectures. Only gives you 4 days to complete assignments. At least one part of each assignment is not covered in lecture, so be prepared to figure it out yourself (6 hrs minimum per assignment and 7-8 assignments). Absolutely no late assignments accepted. Midterm and Final are moderately difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2011<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a very difficult course for me, but his lectures were interesting.  He doesn't really like questions during lecture, but he'll take all the time you need privately.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2011<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  He tells you all the time to practice and if you do then you will get an A.  He wants his students to do well and cares that they do.  Very easy to talk too.  Good guy. Midterm and Final are pretty easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2010<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult subject matter but he was extremely available to his students.  Would definitely recommend taking his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2010<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof. Definitely taking him again. The material is tough, but if kept up with it isn't too bad. Really prepares you for the tests by telling you what to expect. Takes his time, goes through the material slowly to make sure it is completely understood.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2010<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT take if you have other classes or a job.  His homework takes up way too much of your time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2010<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Professor but he makes you work for it.  It's good in a way but at the same time if you have other classes it's time consuming and it draws your attention away from those other classes which is not good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2009<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent instructor! I wouldn't say the classes are super easy, but we're here to learn, so that's good. Prof. Mendelsohn is very good about assisting students outside of class, and he explains the material very thoroughly. It is obvious that he really enjoys teaching, and wants his students to be successful. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2009<br>Class Name: JAVA211<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is rough for the Summer. It goes too fast. Around the end of the course, he really sped up to keep up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2009<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a nice guy but he grades really hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: CSC200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is nice if you want to learn with little effort, you go to class which is not mandatory and you sit back and listen to the lecture. Midterm and Final were easy as long as you look over the material a little bit and there were only a few homework assignments- that took 10 minutes.  Professor is a really nice guy, i recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: CSC200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really nice and down to earth. He is also really smart- he is a doctor and starting his residency soon.  I would recommend him- he doesn't take attendance, but is always really helpful if you do not understand something.  the midterm and final are easy if you go to class or look at the powerpoints. homework=easy. take this class if you need</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class will come very easy if you have a background in webdesign or computers but if your taking this for ur liberal studies you might struggle. Was anal about us taking notes of our own and if you dont have your monitor off when hes lecturing. He doesnt use the book so DONT GET IT! get the sparknotes. 8 assignments midterm final and has own notes</div></div></div></body></html>
