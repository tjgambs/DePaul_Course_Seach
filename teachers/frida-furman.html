Heavily influenced by class participation and group discussions--without it, there will definitely be long awkward pauses. Reading is essential for both the midterm and final.

Expect to read roughly 50 pages of readings and write 700 words in preparation for each class.  She assigns a video for us to watch and write a paper on but she provides us with no means to watch the video--telling us to go buy it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2015<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just thinking of her class gave me anxiety. She calls on students to answer tough questions and she plays devils advocate to the extreme. She enjoys putting students on the spot so if you're shy at all, steer clear!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2014<br>Class Name: REL252<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Furman knows her stuff and expect students to immerse themselves into the material. She's a very nice lady and is willing to help students understand what is expected of them. Furman can be a little biased on certain topics ;)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: REL252<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>Grades are completely based on papers and attendance. She makes you find and buy videos for homework assignments. Her prompts are the worst, like she thinks that you're majoring in this material. She also has very unclear handwriting, which I hated. She's a kind woman, you can always talk to her if you need to, but I would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2014<br>Class Name: PAX252REL252<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Furman is really knowledgeable about the subject and exposes you to several different points of view. This class is all discussion-based and super super interesting! I would recommend this to absolutely anyone! Dr. Furman is really approachable and experienced in the subject. You even read some articles she wrote based on case studies she did</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a highly overrated professor, most likely as a result of her obvious small size and old age. She's clearly one-sided about every issue discussed and doesn't take no for an answer when you're called to speak. You have to write 10+ papers, then she collects & grades only 3 of them; harsh grader, too. AVOID</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2014<br>Class Name: REL252<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Favorite Professor at DePaul hands down! She's so insightful and the class is a blast! Easy grader. Would take it again if i could. Not too much reading, only a lil. I would say just the right amount. ilysm Frida !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: WGS316416<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult grader. Huge reading load.  Topics are great, the books are really interesting (fatness, body modification, disability, mixed-race, and deaf culture). Professor Furman, herself, is pretty hard to warm up to. She's judemental, shuts down conversations when they go in directions she doesn't like. Overall, Good course, bad professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2013<br>Class Name: PAX252<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOTS OF READING. Class reminded me of high school setting. Discussion participation is required. She is nice if you're on her good side, not nice if you're not.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2011<br>Class Name: REL252<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING PROFESSOR! We had to read 4 books and there were a lot of readings which scared me because I hate reading but they were all really interesting. She really knows her stuff and if you read and participate you will love the class and do really well. I ended up with an A. Just take the class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2011<br>Class Name: PAX252<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher will not take anyone who wishes to argue/disagree with her. Also, if you did not grow up with a religious back grouund AVOID her as she seems to take it as a prerequisite.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: MLS416<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor at DePaul. She is set in her ways, and if you challenge a thought or concept, she will get angry. Also, she uses members of the class to help her explain the books. Ex: have a book about being fat, she will chose the biggest person in the class to help get the point across. In our class she made people cry. Avoid her at all costs!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2011<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The amount of reading assigned is simply insurmountable in the time frame that is given if you have a full schedule. She teaches like a high school teacher and has way too many unnecessary rules. I would not classify her as particularly open-minded to student interpretations of religion. If you want an enjoyable religion class dont take it with her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2011<br>Class Name: MLS416<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor makes students sit in a circle and share thoughts about readings. Don't disagree with her or you will get her wrath. Treats us all like we are in 5th grade. Avoid her at all costs!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2010<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've NEVER complained about a professor. I watched her make others feel silly and for a professor teaching comparative world religions, she was pretty closed minded. Also, the only way she would really grade your final paper (that I worked seriously hard on) was if you turned it in with a postage paid/addressed envelope. Why am I paying $2,000&#63;!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: REL102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING professor. Best i've had so far at DePaul. Not an easy class, but well worth your time. I've never learned more from any other professor. Truly inspiring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2009<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a LOTTT of reading, but most of it is pretty interesting.  It's a seminar style class so you all just basically talk about the books, only a little bit of lecture so you stay relatively engaged if you speak up every now and then.  I liked the class, not too much work: couple reflections, two papers, and group project. I'd take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2007<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING teacher. Not an easy class at all, you have to read and she's kind of a tough grader, but so worth it. She's interested in helping you form your own opinions and is very passionate about the subject. Lectures and class discussions are interesting and will greatly expand your mind. Definitely take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2007<br>Class Name: REL294<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Women and Religion: Furman was nice enough, but the class was anything but easy.  You must skim the readings at least, b/c she makes you right responses on them and collects them twice in the quarter.  Tests were challenging but do-able, but tough paper grader.  Got a B+ with average work put in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2007<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easily one of the best profs I've had here, and probably one of the best DePaul has.  Is NOT an easy class nor an easy teacher, but sparks enough interest that makes the class/reading interesting. Do all of the reading, answer your questions and take notes.  Is not an extremely tough grader if you pay attention to her writing guidelines. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2006<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Furman is brilliant and hilarious.  She gives you a lot of information and you really have to think about what is talked about in class.  There is a lot of reading, but for the most part it is all really interesting.  Definitely take her if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Furman is a great professor and very educated on the material.  Definitely do the readings, it will be pretty impossible to write the papers without it.  Be prepared to participate in discussions or she will call on you. Difficult class and papers, but I think it was worth the effort.  I learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart professor. Loves what she teaches. She is very animated, so class is hardly ever boring. Uses the text a lot, so you will be confused if you don't read. I loved her and I loved this class, but I am also greatly interested in religions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is smart and knows what she is talking about, but honestly by taking this class she made me want to drop OUT of school that's how bad it was.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2006<br>Class Name: WMS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can learn a lot if you pay attention and try.  Not an easy A.  C is actually average.  Good for a challenge and she will give you a lot of information and present new tools for analysis.  Then she will challenge you to arrange it all together in papers and on tests.  If you have any brains at all: Take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2006<br>Class Name: ISP316<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows what she is teaching. The papers that you have to write is unclear because she uses big words. She expects everyone to have a doctoral degree and write amazing papers. She literally tries to make your paper, HER own paper, which was pretty bogus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I guess it all depends the syllabus you get. Mine was good, but it seems like she expects you to write like E.B. White-- and your graded papers are marked for inproper grammar n'stuff. She combined a lot of contemporary litterature with theological dimensions, which is good, but after a while it seemed more like a darned litterature course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2005<br>Class Name: HON<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sub parr at best</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2005<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's obvious that she is a very smart woman, and she expects you to perform to the best of your abilities so don't expect an easy A.  It wasn't boring which is always a plus, but you have to come to class.  I give this class a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2005<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall a good class.  She will open your mind and challenge your thoughts about other cultures and religions, but overall she is awesome.  She grades pretty easy and is always willing to accept a draft and grade it for revision.  Good class, great teacher, take her if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2005<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brilliant woman! This was one of my favorite classes. If you simply keep up with the reading and participate in discussion, you'll be fine. The material is complex, I mean...it is religion, but Furman explains things in a way that everyone can understand. I love Furman</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely intelligent.  Assignments are not difficult but you cannot bs them.  Its not hard to get a B, but you do have to have pretty polished writing for an A.  Loves discussion:participation and attendance count.
