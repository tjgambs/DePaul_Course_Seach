Did not really delve into the readings or the topics we discussed. I feel as though I could teach the subject better. Does not care about the class. Not worth taking. Presentations were horribly organized. Stay away from this professor. Not worth the head ache. She is an incompetent professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2012<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really has no grasp on how to educate people. Gave 2-3 long readings a class which no one did. All over the place, would assign things that weren't posted, couldn't answer questions in class, it was just a disaster.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2012<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very sweet lady, Islamic Banking was a very interesting course, she is a very easy going professor and easy to talk to, no crazy work load. midterm, group project, open note final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>no communications with students never replies to emails very unclear with what she wants on tests</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2010<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her class based on the first set of reviews given to her. To my surprise, the class was very different. I assume she changed the curriculum. She doesn't take attendance. There are 2 quizzes, midterm, final, and a paper. The paper was only the easy part of the class which she gives everyone a 100%. Unfortunately it's only weighs 10% of grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2010<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>oh dear god its over its finally over.i hope to never see her or take her class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2010<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny seeing that 90% of the class is online on D2L (new blackboard) at 4 AM studying for this POS final because Karen doesn't know how to teach. Her exact words were &quot;You won't be tested on anything before midterm&quot; and then the review guide she put up tells us we need to know all the chapters from first half of the class. WTF. nerd rage.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2010<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To add to my review below: Class lecture is her going over power point so no point in going to class. I mean I don't know what to say. I am disappointed. I assumed it would be an easy A for an intro course by the way people gave her reviews below. And no, I'm not bitter because of midterm, I got a decent grade, but I expected higher. Good luck</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2010<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took during summer session. Easy class for FIN majors, because all C of Commerce students take it. We had two guest speakers, which made class interesting. Go to class, do the HW, take 4-5 tests, easy A. We used the book extensively, so make sure to buy, and study it. Nice women don't hesitate to ask questions/for help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. SHE IS GREAT. FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT GOOD AT FINANCE, IF YOU WILL DO ALL THE WORK YOU WILL GET AN 'A'. THE FINAL WAS EASIER THAN THE MIDTERM. TAKE HER AND YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Final grade was higher than expected. Online homework which you have 3 chances to get 100 and it provides you with clues and sometimes solutions. Midterm and Final. Learn problems rather than terms. Nothing but problems on the final. Class can be boring, but just work the in class problems and you'll do well. Recommend taking her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>final was way easier than the midterm, she gave us a lot of extra credit, but i think thats because she missed about 4 classes, idk if she will do it for u, class was w/e but she was cool, i recommend for 310</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2008<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy teacher. She is really nice and is very fair. She is a fun loving person and tries her best to keep everyone interested. Taking her again in the spring. Take her if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What an awesome instructor.  Very kind, fair, and tries to make class interesting.  We worked on HW problems in class and only handed in 3 assignments the whole quarter...If you're a finance major, take her....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: MGT219<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an interesting woman but her class is very dull. You will be reading lots of old philosophical texts and then relating them to the business world. It is a fairly easy class if you do the work but it is very boring and she does not do anything to spice it up, she relies a lot on class participation but does not know how to get the class going</div></div></div></body></html>
