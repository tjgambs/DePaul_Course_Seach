One of the harder classes I've taken but Will offers great advice without giving you the answer.  Homework takes a lot of effort but very rewarding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2015<br>Class Name: CSC401<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>This class is very difficult as a 5-week course.  I would recommend taking it as a regular 10-week course.  Classmates and professor are really helpful and responsive when you post on the class discussion board.  Reading the material before class helps you grasp the concepts better.  Professor is always willing to answer any questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2015<br>Class Name: CSC406<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think I'd do better just reading the book. He's very knowledgeable but could use some teaching pointers. Penalizes you for "guessing", which is frustrating if you've narrowed it down to two answers but know that leaving the question blank hurts your grade less than getting it wrong.  That is not conducive to learning. It's nerve-racking. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2015<br>Class Name: CSC348<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He clearly knows what he's talking about and genuinely wants to teach. If you need help he'll  help you find the answer but he's not going to hold your hand. The grade consists mostly of a large project which is fairly time consuming, so don't procrastinate. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2015<br>Class Name: CSC401<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Be ready for tons of assignments. Will not accept late submissions. Overall, it was a good course. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2015<br>Class Name: CSC421<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I believe he is a good teacher, however, I feel like he know what to teach, but don't know how to teach.  This is NOT a course for fun. The course is mainly about java, be prepared to read through the dictionary thick textbook. if anyone don't have any basic knowledge for java. Please avoid him as you can. Exams are hard. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2014<br>Class Name: CSC401<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really clear and knows how to teach. He was teaching Python for the first time but he did excellent as far as focusing on subjects and teaching them. His exams are little tougher. In class exams with one cheat sheet allowed and has a mild curve. Don't expect an A for showing up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2014<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just finishing up systems 1 for the summer session. Honestly, he is a brilliant guy but he has a hard time transferring that knowledge to students. Labs are not that hard if you have some previous experience but the exams are a different story. Did very well on the labs, on the exams not so much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2014<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes his lectures cover the material, and yes he knows his stuff. Don't even bother asking a question because his answer will be what he already said. If you don't understand, it's up to you to figure it out. And the assignments are extra deep dives into material that only got glossed over, so unless you already know how to do it, you're SOL.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2014<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yeah... hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2014<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: INC</div><div id="right"><div>1st week of 5 (Summer I) and I'm dropping. I don't doubt he knows his stuff. I just don't think he's good at explaining it. You better know C language if you take him. It's hard to what the main points from his lectures. I would avoid</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2014<br>Class Name: CSC376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best professors at DePaul! He knows what he's talking about and has homework assignments that teach you alot. Don't listen to people who say he has too much work, those are just really lazy people. If you want to learn, take his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2014<br>Class Name: CSC407<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>For lecture he just used the slides that came with the book, which was frustrating. But he was patient and good with answering in-class questions, at least. The real issue are the labs. They're extremely complicated and he offers basically no help whatsoever. Even when you're done with the labs, there's no way to find out right answers afterwards.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2012<br>Class Name: CSC348<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>2.8 !!! That's so inaccurate. He gets 5 out 5. In his courses, at least you learn something & you get the grade you deserve based on how much work you put into it. Unlike with other professors, in Will's courses, you earn a good grade but your not entitled to it. Check course evaluations at CDM for accurate rating.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2012<br>Class Name: CSC435<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was weary of this professor due to the comments posted, however, I found Prof M to be a highly effective instructor.  He seems very aware of his students' understanding of the subject matter and tailors his lectures accordingly. Unlike many of his peers, not only is he very knowledgeable, he has a sound grasp of effective teaching methods.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2011<br>Class Name: CSC348<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fairly difficult class, but if you thought the core computer science classes should be easy, perhaps you should go into IS. Marrero is NOT a bad instructor, and he answered all my questions when I had them. Your work after college won't consist of everything being spoon-fed to you. This man provides a much needed reality check for some.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2011<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor & really nice guy. Always helpful and explains well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2011<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes he's nice, but class lecture doesn't correlate much with labs except the few times we go over a lab problem (only if someone brings it up). Help on questions is vague and takes 24 hours. Exam Q's are directly from book, but it's hard to keep up. Only take CSC-373 with this prof if you have prior knowledge of C and assembly debugging.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2011<br>Class Name: CSC376<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the worst professor I've ever had in my life, and I am not learning a thing! He seems like a nice guy but a terrible teacher. I hate to rate him like this but I must be honest. Only take this class if you have prior knowledge!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2010<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is was the first programming class I've ever taken and beforehand, I was very excited to learn more about programming but Marrero is not a good teacher. He's not good at explaining ANYTHING and while he's a lenient grader, you won't learn much. He's even admitted to not having used C++ in awhile. DO NOT TAKE ANY PROGRAMMING CLASSES WITH HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2010<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was looking forward to taking a programing class but his poor teaching ruined it. He is very hard to contact with questions about the homework and you will have a lot of questions because he does a poor job of explaining in class. when he contacts you back its usually to late. I have a high B in the class maybe an A and honestly do not deserve it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2010<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>doesn't explain subject clearly, teaches class like an advance class (C++ 2 not C++ 1). I've received 100s on his homework but still don't understand the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2009<br>Class Name: SE435<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He didn't grade homework until the end of quarter. His voice was very soft. It'very hard to hear him when I din't sit in front of class. Anyway, he's nice</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2009<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, I found the purpose of this class beyond stupid as we used programs which I will NEVER use again. But Prof. Marrero did a good job explaining the material although sometimes it seemed like he was learning it with us.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2009<br>Class Name: CSC421<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Homework problems are only difficult because of the technical environment the professor created. E.g. some programming commands cannot be used in his environment. Exams are nothing like the homework assignments so you might feel completely unprepared on exam day. The professor is helpful only when it suits him so be prepared to struggle alone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2008<br>Class Name: CS421<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A difficult instructor to follow. He tries to be helpful but his explanations generally don't shed any light on the issue. Homework is difficult exams are more difficult... be ready to work HARD if you have this instructor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2007<br>Class Name: IT140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy is pretty cool. Sit up front to hear his lectures; has a soft voice. If you ask questions he will try his best to help. he seemed eager to help us do our best. Didn't use the book a lot, mostly internet source websites. quizzes about everyother wednesday, as long as you do the labs you will do fine on the quizzes. drops the lowest quiz gra</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2007<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away from this professor.  If you take CSC 373 with him, you will have a nightmare.  He won't help you much and will not permit you to find outside information.  His homework assignments also are much too difficult compared to the amount of information that he gives you during class.  The midterm/final exams are also outrageously difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: CSC262<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid taking any class with this guy.  His lectures dont go along with his homework assignments. Not very helpful and will not be too hard on homeworks but his exams are rough.  only take him if its your last quarter and dont want to come back another quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2007<br>Class Name: CSC262<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't seem to care very much about whether or not his students do well. Hardly anyone attends class and he doesn't say a word. Very slow in responding to e-mails and condescending when he does. Lectures are difficult to understand. Somewhat flexible on grading policies, but not on the actual grading. Avoid taking his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2006<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really difficult teacher. even if you try studying from the book, attend lectures you still end up confused and frustrated. not a good professor overall, wont help with assignments and tests/quizzes/homework dont reflect what he teaches</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very challenging class. If you are willing to spend a considerable ammount of time on the class, it can really be a lot of fun. I didn't think the midterm was too bad, and he gives pleanty of time for the assignments. I've always been able to get something explained when I had a question, and he is good about staying in touch via email.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2006<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst prof. I ever had to deal with in my college life! He doesn't help you out at all, he doesn't teach the topics properly, he makes no sense! HE FORBIDS YOU from trying to gain outside help, but he wont help himself. He considers you a cheater if you try to gain knowledge from other sources. I am writting a letter to the board!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2006<br>Class Name: CSC550<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great instructor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2005<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor does not explain anything, and much of the homework/tests do not reflect what he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is HARD, he doesnt spend enough time teaching the material thoroughly. The ER Diagrams and SQL queries were way too advanced for an introduction course and the whole class did bad on it. The final is 3 parts take home, but hard, make sure you know someone else in the class and copy what you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2005<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor.
