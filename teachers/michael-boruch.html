Would not recommend. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Nice enough guy, I guess. Hard to understand though. His class is incredibly easy, and you can turn things in whenever you want. I didn't even do 2 of the projects and still got a B+. He's old and not good with technology, don't expect an email response within 3 weeks. Talks for hours on things that are irrelevant.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this class. The professor can be funny and seems like a nice man but he stutters, goes off on tangents, and all he does is show slides of old photographs all class. He also assigns loads of work that seems pointless and doesn't really take into account that we all have 3 other courses to worry about. The class is all over the the place.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2013<br>Class Name: LSP100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very scattered and confusing. He is a nice man, but teaching should not be his profession.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He made my ears bleed. Do not take him. He makes it seem as if his class is the most important class, when in reality its something we are forced to take as freshmen.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Despite the high amount of reading and busy work, it was easy! I hardly did any of the reading, but did the work and attended class. His classes were a little boring but mainly just slideshows and he is really funny.Grading was inconsistent and not very timely, but he was VERY lenient with late work.I turned in my midterm paper with my final paper!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome.  Just take him for an easy A whenever he teaches a class.  He is so funny!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is overall a really nice guy! Sometimes he may go off on tangents, and I feel like I didnt learn too much from him. The workload is really easy and he usually gives you the benefit of the doubt.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2011<br>Class Name: LSP603<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an awesome professor. It was the only class I looked forward to every week. He is pretty unorganized but there isn't much work anyway. Midterm and Final Paper. Reading notes. During-class field trips. Easy and fun class for all freshmen.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy professor yet very knowledgable. Really nice guy to talk to. Highly recommended for all freshmen.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, if you do even 50% of the homework, you'll get an A because no one else takes him seriously enough to do it. I would recommend this teacher and class to any Freshman at Depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Michael Boruch is one of the most genuine teachers I've ever had. On a personal level he is a 5 star. Yet in class he is all over the place. Completely disorganized (he lost an assignment of mine), difficult to understand, and has very little control of the class. He wants to be helpful but it is difficult to keep patient when dealing with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a character. He is really intelligent, but he rambles sometimes and his speech is somewhat impared, but you cant blame him for it. If you are looking to get the most out of your class, skip, if you want a fun professor who swears like a trucker at times, he's the guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love him! He is super interesting and loves what he does. He loves offensive jokes and swears quite a bit, so you have to have the right sense of humor, but he is SO nice and knows a little bit of everything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2010<br>Class Name: PHOTO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He rocks!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2010<br>Class Name: PHOTO101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really nice person and you learn a lot from him just by talking to him and hearing his stories.  I recommend him. He is super friendly and wants you to do well. By the end of the course you will really appreciate him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2009<br>Class Name: EXPL111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice enough guy but perhaps one of the most unoganized teachers I have ever met.  He s constantly revising the syllabus but even so, he never sticks to it.  His blackboard account is impossible to find things on. Documents are scattered all over.  He loves the subject but he is not the best professor to learn from.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2009<br>Class Name: LPS111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's funny, makes a lot of jokes, however I feel like we never accomplish anything in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2009<br>Class Name: EXP206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a very nice professor. Although he stuttered, he tried very hard to make his point clear. He is really loves his subject with maxwell street. He asks for simple projects and loves class participation. Sweetest Prof I've met so far.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is unorganized and hard to understand because of a speech impediment. However, he is very understanding and knows what he is talking about. I can see why people don't like him but if you talk in class and try to make it fun like he does its really not bad at all. I think he loves teaching, I pulled a B+ and was sick most of the quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: FPS112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>How he is still teaching, I don't know. It is required I take his class, unfortunately. Read what people have been saying. Very disorganized, changes and never goes by the syllabus, changes subjects. Bottom line don't take, crazy hard grader and teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2009<br>Class Name: FPS112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never used the book, $70 book used. grades severely hard and i dont know how he gets away with grading so hard. sucks as a teacher, changes subject too much while talking. Someone from DePaul should take action, sit in on his class, horrendous teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>With what people on here have been saying I totally agree. I love photography and am an art major but I started to hate photography after his classes. He is a very boring teacher, never gets the students involved, talks the whole class. And worst he never stays on topic, his ramblings is a sever distraction. People sleep and yawn in his class and I</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: EXPL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>once you get over how long it takes him to say things and him talking about random stuff he's pretty funny. He seems to grade stuff really hard and is the most unorganized person ever. He changes the syllabus every week and you wont know whats goin on</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most unorganized person I have ever met. I had to turn in the same assignment three separate times because he kept losing it. He also failed really to assign anything until the last two weeks of class, when he assigned a research paper, group presentation, and notes on about 20 articles and 2 books. He didnt explain the criteria for the assignments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very scatterbrained at times, and the stutter might bother some people, but the fact is that he is an extremely knowledgeable man who will go out of his way to help those in his class. Ignore the minor quibbles, and take him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice man, hes extremely smart and he knows what hes talking about but he gets off topic alot and is unclear for what he wants for assignments. he wants you to do well so he's very helpful and understanding on late assignments. Easy A if you do the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2007<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most nicest teacher's at DePaul. But treis to do too much with too little time. Assignments are all over the place, and he himself has no idea what he is doing. Constant stutter does not help. If you like fieldtrips on weekends then take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice man who tends to ramble. What makes it worse is his terrible stutter. Not bery organized, but is very understanding and tries to help whenever he can. Th class is basically a snooze fest that occasionally makes you want to gouge your eyes out in boredom.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>CLASS WAS OK. VIEWED SLIDES MOST OF THE TIME. IMAGE ANALYSIS ASSIGNMENTS WERE TOO MUCH AND THERE WERE TOO MANY OF THEM. MID TERM AND FINAL RESEARCH PAPERS. DIDNT USE THE BOOK AT ALL SO IM OUT 60 DOLLARS. OK CLASS I GUESS</div></div></div></body></html>
