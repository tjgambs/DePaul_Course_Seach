    Don't take her as your professor! She never has time for her students, being that she has another job and she also is in grad school. In addition, she is very hard to get in contact with. I would e-mail her and it would take days to get a response (if I even got one). It was 2 credits and with the amount of work it it should have been 4. DONT TAKE
