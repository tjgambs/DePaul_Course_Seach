Highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2015<br>Class Name: REL266<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very easy going and the class is simple if you show up. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: HST142<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Mbengue's class is really easy for those who want to get over B. However, his lectures are boring and just few students can keep up with them. After two or three classes, you start understanding his accent. I think he should improve his hand writing a little bit more too finally he wants to help students but he cuts points of from grammar a lot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: 295<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Mbengue has a really heavy accent so it is hard to understand him. He lectures by reading straight from his notes. He scribbles a few notes on the board, leaving you have to try to understand his english and put it into notes. He is a really sweet guy, but I would not recommend him to anyone. Great person but awful at teaching. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2015<br>Class Name: IWS295<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for Sectarian Movements of Islam, Slight accent but more than understandable. Has a little spunk to him which is refreshing. Truly a very well versed man, and highly intellectual yet not arrogant about it at all. Actually gives a damn about his students. great grader, 90s and above   2 papers 4 simple quizzes  A 10 page final paper </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2015<br>Class Name: HST142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor! English is his fourth language!! I am pretty sure he speaks more than four languages. Very perceptive! The way he engages students is quite phenomenal. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2015<br>Class Name: HST142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He's got an accent, but it's not undecipherable. Easy grader, just follow basic instructions. 2-3 papers and weekly quizzes. Very easy stuff. Definitely will take him again. Don't need the textbook. Easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: 271<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice man, but gives very boring lectures. He has an accent and a stutter so it can be hard to understand him at times. He is an easy grader once you get the hang of his class. His quizzes are in depth, but fairly easy if you study your notes. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: REL271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Took some time to get used to his strong accent but Dr. Mbengue puts lots of effort to ensure his students fully understand the material. He's willing to slow things down, if you ask, and go over things again as needed. VERY HELPFUL & NICE. Always answers emails right away. Will stay after class 2 talk to students. Very knowledgeable and passionate</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2014<br>Class Name: IWS271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mbengue is a really great teacher and I think it does him a disservice to say he is simply easy. I mean, he is a generally relaxed teacher, but perhaps that's because he is understanding. Also, his lectures are really thorough so if you pay attention, quizzes and papers should not be hard. Overall a fantastic teacher. Kind and humorous.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: REL116<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard to understand but hes so sweet. Study for his quizzes and you'll do fine- usually about 10 ?s. About 4 papers (3 pages min) and a final paper (10 pgs) you can literally bs it and do well. Easy A! Don't need the book at all, don't need to do the readings. PPTs online too. Takes attendance @ end of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: HST143<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Mbengue is one of the nicest teachers I have ever had. He sincerely cares about his students and his grading is not too difficult. Most of the information you will need for quizzes can be attained from his lecture. Great teacher, really made me interested in Muslim History.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2013<br>Class Name: IWS228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really easy class, would definitely recommend. I'm averaging a 95 so far without reading the book. 4 quizzes, 2 short essays and a 10 page essay final. really easy grader. The only bad thing is that an A is a 95 or above. an A- is 90-95.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2013<br>Class Name: HST110143<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this professor three times and got an A every time. He is a very nice, easy grader; however, his lectures are tedious, meticulous, and ridiculously boring. Two to three 3-page papers, five quizzes, and a final 10 page paper; in addition, I would say that if you take interest  and participate you will learn a lot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2013<br>Class Name: HST143<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mbengue is a really nice and easy teacher who is always willing to help. He knows the materiel well and his quizzes aren't very hard as long as you give yourself at least half an hour to study. While yes the class can feel boring at times if you can put up with this than I would highly recommend his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2013<br>Class Name: IWS271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Mbengue rules!!!!!!!!!!!!! super sweet and super easy!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2013<br>Class Name: IWS271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mbengue RULES.

Slight accent wasnt a problem for me. Very easy grader but 95-100 is an a and 95-90 was an A- and of course I ended up with a 94. Kind of pissed off. Class was moderately interesting but nowhere near necessary. He di take attendence but if he didnt I would never show up except for quizez/due dates and days before quizzes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2011<br>Class Name: PLSC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an easy grader, he is very clear and if you just attend class and do the assignments you will get an A. He likes participation in class and never lets you know his opinions. LOVED HIM. TAKE HIM ! He is a GPA BOOST !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2011<br>Class Name: IWS116<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class! Quizzes were right off the power points (which he also puts on d2l) and only 3 papers. He agrees to look over them before hand, and is a fairly easy grader. Would def recommend taking him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2011<br>Class Name: REL116<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, easy grader 4 Quizzes that are right from the lecture power points (he posts power points online) 2 papers (3-5pages) and one ten page paper as a final. Very easy class! he even gives 5/10 questions that will be on the quizzes the class before.

He would give monotonous lectures on Monday and he went over the same exact things on Wednesday, and had the most stupid discussion questions imaginable.  He is very easy, but I feel I didn't learn as much as I would have liked about Islam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: IWS116<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mbenge is a really good professor. His lectures are not boring, and he brings up good discussion topics but its up to the class to participate. 3 papers, 1 research paper (easy, just combine the 3 papers plus 1 more page), and 4 quizzes, and he is a really easy grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2010<br>Class Name: REL266<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy but his class is SOOOOOOOOOO BORING. I dreaded going to his class every day because it was the same monotonous routine all the time. He is a ridiculously easy grader and very knowledgeable on Islam, but the class is 90 minutes of torture. If you want an easy A with a numbingly boring class take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2010<br>Class Name: IWS217<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Babacar is a good, coherent professor, and his class structure and grading system are great for an elective.  4 quizzes, 3 short papers, and 1 10 pg research paper for a final.  Ridiculously easy grader, seemed like he gave me high 90's on everything (kinda mad they weren't 100's).  Take him if you like Islam and don't mind a slight African accent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2010<br>Class Name: IWS266<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class itself was kind of boring but I liked professor Mbengue.
