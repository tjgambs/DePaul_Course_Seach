No matter how hard you try, your writing capabilities will never be up to his standards. Way harder than expected even when you just watch movies all the time. I regret taking this class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: PPS201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Assignments do not involve critical analysis, rather outlining what you read, and there's little room for critical conversation. If you're disagreeing, objectively, with another student who you're on good terms with, he will stop you from continuing seconds into it, and then refuse to allow either of you to speak despite class demands.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2014<br>Class Name: HON301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Students are required to present two times during the quarter which resulted in at least 2 people giving presentations per class session. Because of this, reading was not necessary and the class was largely student led. I was excited about the content material before the class but the excitement quickly diminished as the quarter went on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: PPS201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Very poor quality. Class is basically student-led. He does not teach or lecture very much at all. There was a large amount of reading and eventually I just stopped trying to keep up. He is confusing and his assignments aren't very hard but they aren't interesting or helpful either. Only take this class if you need to. Avoid taking for an elective.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2013<br>Class Name: PPS253<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Taking this class was a big mistake. He is unclear in what he wants and grades papers more harshly than most English teachers. I think he expects you to write a PhD level analysis. Fulfill your Gen Ed requirement with something else, this one's not worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2012<br>Class Name: PPS255<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think he is a very knowledgeable man, but seems to lack people skills. For the assigned paper he asked students to meet with him and was very concerned about us learning how to write a public policy paper, which I appreciated, but he failed to give much advice or examples as to what he wanted us to do. If you are a non-major, avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2012<br>Class Name: PPS350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accent is a hard to understand, but he is extremely knowledgable about  the subject.

Not too hard if you read...if you want to do well attending class is mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: PPS254<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice professor. Only complaint is that he doesn't answer emails promptly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: PPS255<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knowledgeable. Requires class participation, but just asks your opinion on the topic, so not difficult to find something to say. A far amount of reading but all interesting and easy to read. Class assignments include: 10-page paper, take home midterm, 25-page group project, and a bringing two current stories to class for discussion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2007<br>Class Name: PPS225<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Globalization class was somewhat boring and his accent was hard to understand. The huge group project is annoying to me, But if you like working in groups then sign up. He teaches difficult material well but is not about flair or entertaining, just teaches.  I learned alot. Kind of egotistical and has favorites!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2007<br>Class Name: HON301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a horrible professor, he ran the class like a Ph.D level class with his ridiculous paper assignments. He expects you to read every piece every written and incorporate it in your paper and expects you to rewrite it 3 times. He doesn't understand students have things like jobs, etc. We don't have time to read and rewrite like he did. HORRIBLE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2006<br>Class Name: PPS255<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is not bad, he personally is not helpful, and often wants to meet with his students in his office...wierd....he encourages for you to see him in his office for papers....  on papers he does not like own opinions likes to hear what he says, do this and you shall receive a descent grade..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2006<br>Class Name: PPS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class, you don't have to do the reading and he is a very easy grader.

I love boring topics, too.  Give me non-fiction or give me death! Readings have nothing to do with course, papers are pointless, GROUP PROJECT from hell, and total lack of clarity!

The discussions were interesting, although some of the students were very frustrating.  I think that although he might grade a LITTLE harder on papers, he is still a good prof.  I would take him again if the chance came up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: PPS255<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Some Advice For His Future Students-              GLOBALIZATION INDUSTRIALIZATION NEUTRALIZATION STERALIZATION IZATION IZATION IZATION....GET A DICTIONARY...MEMOIRIZE EVERYTHING WITH IZATION...AND U WILL BE FINE....OH YEAH....HE IS BORING AS ALL HELL</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2004<br>Class Name: HON204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>kind of borring but it may come along with the content of the class.  do your reading and you'll be fine.  oh, and drink some coffee before class.  it'll keep you awake.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2004<br>Class Name: PSC254<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was really excited about this class, and it had the potential to be really interesting.  But each movie had pretty much the same social 'lesson' behind it.  I thought the prof. was really unhelpful and completely egotistical.  And if you don't say/write EXACTLY what he would have, goodbye grade!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2004<br>Class Name: PPS253<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Personally, very nice and helpful. As a professor, he lectures very little. I agree with the comment about too much discussion. The films we watched were awesome though. Sometimes however it feels like a high school class...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: PPS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Demissie is the best professor at DePaul! He has helped so many people and is still such an accomplished man. He is incredibly intelligent and truly believes in the art of intellectual growth.

Relied too heavily on class discussion, because, to be honest, I really don't give a**** what other students I have to say, I want to hear the guy with the doctorate who's an expert in the field.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: PPS254<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In screening suburbia class, thought his lectures were SO boring and cliche.Liked students who said stupid typical comments.He went on power trips with grading and lateness policies, which he did not clarify but claimed he had. may be nice, dont recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not a bad professor, makes you look at things in ways you might not have seen them. i think he's from south africa, which makes it difficult to understand him (like, i would concentrate on his accent instead of what he had to say) but overall, nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2004<br>Class Name: HON204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BORING, it's hard to stay awake in the class.
