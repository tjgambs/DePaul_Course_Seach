Very loving, understanding, and informative.  The class wasn't too challenging, but had me engaged more than any course I've taken here.  He actually cares about his students and their success.  If you have an opportunity to take him during the short time he is here, do it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: CMN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Beasley is THE BEST professor that I've had at DePaul!
