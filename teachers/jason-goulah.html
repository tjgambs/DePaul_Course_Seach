    After 14 classes in the graduate program in education at DePaul, there is absolutely no question that Jason is the most creative, supportive, scholarly professor in the program.  Jason embodies the mission of DePaul as a school focused on urban education and advancement of education for those at the margins.  Quite simply an inspiration to us all.

    He does a good job trying to engage students in the class and will crack silly jokes from time to time.  He's a smart guy and sometimes condescending to students.  I hate the way he doesn't really answer questions (he'll respond with "it was in the article we read" or "we talked about it three weeks ago"). Sorry I don't have a photographic memory!

    Dr. Goulah is terrific! By far one of the best teachers at DePaul. He is enthusiastic, knowledgeable, interesting and passionate about his topics. He does a great job moderating dialogue in the classroom setting. I would take his class again any time.
