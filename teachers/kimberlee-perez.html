Wish more professors were like her. Through discussion, you learn about real life applicable things, rather than being lectured at & having to memorize facts like most other classes. She wants you to do well & is very genuine. No tests. 2 papers & weekly reading questions. Easy, but useful class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2012<br>Class Name: CMN396<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took Kimberlee for Senior Capstone. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I'm slightly biased because this is my third class with Kimberlee, I hunt her down every time, but she's wonderful. No Midterms, no Finals, strictly discussion based along with two papers. She's incredible. Students take turns leading the class in discussion. NOT HARD!!!! Please take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2011<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kimberlee, (as she prefers to be called)is one of the best professors DePaul has to offer. She is extremely engaging, fascinating, fun, and an overall great instructor. You will regret not taking her for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kimberlee is someone who truly cares about each of her students. She's eager to get to know you as a person, and your experiences. The class I had was VERY heavily discussion-based which was perfect.  If you want to take a class at DePaul that matters and will be applicable to your life outside of academia, be sure to take a course with Kimberlee.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2011<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kimberlee is a wonderful professor who trully cares about her students and what she teaches. She remembers everyone by name and don't be surprised if she says hi to you 3 years later like a day had never gone by. The class was interesting, the readings were great, and discussions were some of the best I have ever had at DePaul. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE KIMBERLEE!!! she's an  amazing teacher because she truly cares about how what we learn affects us in the real world as opposed to just stuffing a bunch of facts into our brains only to forget it after midterms.  She's amazing, no regrets about taking her twice :))</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2010<br>Class Name: CMN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great CMN professor, she's passionate about the subject and although topics can get a little blah she really pushes you to expand on your own self reflections and experiences that apply to the readings. Fun class, mostly discuss. Would be better if more than 5 students talked every class lol but would take her again definitely.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Prof. Perez! It is a really laid back class with mostly class discussions.  Be ready to talk! Easy if you apply your real life experiences</div></div></div></body></html>
