    he is horrible..he can't explain even if his life depended on it.  he asks questions to the class rather than giving notes or lecturing.  he is a horrible grader and the midterm was totally unrelated to what was &quot;done&quot; in class.  he is really nice but that doesnt compensate for his lack of ability to teach or explain. stay away!

    STEER CLEAR! Professor Dominguez has no capacity to compose clear, organized lectures. As a result, the Midterm was extremely difficult. As a straight-A upperclassman, I got a C on the test. He is not open to suggestions either. Worst I've had at DePaul.

    His entire class is composed of questions. And worse of all, he doesn't even answer half of the ones he asked! We started off with almost 20 on the first day of class, and we had 10 people at the mid-term. No one can stand going to his class.  I just go for participation grades.  But it's truely just a wast of time becuse you dont' learn anything.

    He'a very good guy who means good but is not an effective teacher. Very unclear. does not prepare his students well for midterm/final. He doesnt seem very prepared for class either. He doesnt give good input back to students on papers and grades were not explained. avoid if possible.

    He is very unclear and constantly asks the class questions that recieve no response b/c they are not understandable.He also says &quot;right&quot; constantly after all his statements.It doesn't make it easier to sit through when the class is boring AND the prof. can't get through a sentance without using fillers.

He is very unclear and basically said study the whole book for the midterm and final.  Almost everyone failed the midterm and the final was horrible.  Unless you want a nrevous breakdown DONT TAKE HIM!!!!

    Looks like George Lopez :D Anyway, a great guy but not a professor for politics. Questions are broad and confusion defines the entire class. Reading is horrendously long and dry. Does not prepare you well for either midterm or final. Paper grading is unequally balanced with points off never being explained. Not politically biased which is good.

    Totally nice guy, pretty mild mannored but not very effective professor. Does not come to class prepared, strays away from main focuses and does not outline or help very much. Expects students to know EVERYTHING and midterm sucked!!! Basically the WHOLE class lost faith in him after midterm. I'm Poli Sci and love it, but this class was horrible...

    Although he is a nice guy, he is not a great teacher. Even though I knew the material, I couldn't understand his questions. The class was boring and there was a lot of reading. He also stutters, doesn't answer your questions well, and doesn't finish his thoughts.

    Is not teacher material.  A nice guy but asks unclear questions and can't imagine why we don't have the answer.  Grades papers without any helpful comments, just a number grade and a couple grammar comments.  Does not make material come to life.  I love politics and am a PoliSci major but I just could not enjoy a moment of this class.

    He's a good teacher and expects the students to comprehend clearly what they read. He does not ask for one word answers, but more clearly developed thoughts so he knows that you understand the concepts. Homework is easy and minimal, the tests are moderately difficult but if you understand the concepts you will do fine. Sometimes repetitive&amp; unclear
