You must be able to keep up with the assignments. Every class there is a quiz, make sure you participate, and she tells you what the test will cover.  Overall she knows her stuff.  Take her!

She makes you work hard, but she knows her****.  I definitely reccommend her.  Just keep up with your stuff, and you will be fine.

I worked hard, and i'm still not getting a really good grade in the class.  Overall, she is a good professor, very demanding, a lot of reading, but you get a lot  out of it.  Be prepared for A LOT of work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2007<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the class was a lot more work than i expected. the material isnt too difficult, but she expects a lot out of you- 15 hours of community service with an 8 page final paper, 2 sets of 2 day finals, and media presentations. very interesting material and shes a good teacher, but be ready to spend a lot of time on the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2007<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor. Lots of readings, but overall a good class. You simply have to be very analytical when it comes to ethics. Participate in class! She remembers and I think she bumps up your grade a little because of it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not bad... didn't think id pass because i argued with her so much. but ended with an A. she's the type of professor who discusses way too much politics when its not necessary for the course. and imposes her political viewpoints on students. theres no disagreeing with her. conservatives beware. very liberal professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2006<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best teacher EVER! yes shes scary the first day...made me cry...but thats just because she wants to get across that this is not a blow off class...if youre just looking for an easy class to fill a requirement for graduation...this is not the class for you...i learned soo much in this class...i think there were like 50 students on the first day...an</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2006<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an extremely nice professor.

There is a lot of reading, and there are quizzes on almost everything you read, but the reading is not hard and she grades very well. She seems a bit intimidating, but she is not bad at all. I would definately suggest taking her for MGT 228;  you'll pass, trust me!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2006<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and extremely clear with her lectures.  For every assigned reading there is a quiz so check your blackboard/syllabus to know what reading is to be finished that day.  Remember the main points of the reading and u should pass the quiz and midterms easily.  Final is a 10 page paper. Will definitely take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2006<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty easy class, but if you are a slacker or think you might slack off do not take her.

She seems tuff and very hard, but I got and A in the class. There is a short paper due every week and the midterm was hard. The final project was a lot of work and involved a speech, but I loved this teacher. She is really nice and is very helpful. If you are a pretty good student you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is ridiculous!!

You write a lot, but she's revising the course for next quarter, so there's not so many writing assignments.  Encourages critical thinking.

She's a deeply religious and caring human being. Depaul kids are probably not committed enough to handle a private college prof.
