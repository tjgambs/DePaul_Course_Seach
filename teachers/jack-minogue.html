There is no textbook, only online readings.  There are no exams.  Every week there are readings which are short except for the first 2 weeks. The videos can be long, but they help understand the week's subject better. You have to post on the dicussion board 3 different times and then write a 1-2 page paper. So EASY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2008<br>Class Name: REL229<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, usually only teachs online classes.
