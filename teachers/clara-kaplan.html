I felt like a learned lots from the class though, and I really liked her as a person too. OK class overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2007<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was decent but I think the prof. could have brought more to the table. I felt like she was learning with us. We got into a big circle and discussed the readings.  There wasn't much variation. She's very nice and was easy to talk to. This teacher was okay; not the best not the worst.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2007<br>Class Name: BBE404<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I realize this is grad school and that professors are not going to lecture. However, this was a very routine class of &quot;get into groups, review the reading, and then we have a group project based on your discussions&quot;. Interesting to learn from other students, but I would have liked to hear a little more from the professor given her expertise.</div></div></div></body></html>
