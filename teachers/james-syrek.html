The best way to get an A is to think outside the box.

I bought a new camera/tripod for this class & now have a new hobby. I appreciate the amount of reasonable time he gave us to d other assignments and he worked with me when I had conflicts such as work, etc. I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2014<br>Class Name: DC411901<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>James treated us like adults and allowed us time outside the class to focus on our videos without slamming us with weekly work.  I appreciated the time I had to put my project together.  He's easy but worth taking</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2014<br>Class Name: DC411901<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Literally the worst teacher I've ever had in earning 2 degrees. Unclear, confusing, tangents galore. Zero content knowledge. Answers questions with other questions. Syllabus is a joke/ made up each night. Avoid if at all possible. I wish I could get a refund for my tuition for this class. Couldn't fill an hour of class time without a break.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This kind of explains the class..."Um you don't have to take the midterm...like it's not required but if you don't take it you'll fail"8</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, and very informative! I learned a lot from this class and would definitely recommend it. Not an overload of homework, but enough to teach you a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2013<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the worst professor EVER. DO NOT TAKE HIM. Whether it's online or in class. I took him online and I literally sent him 30 e-mails about the course, never got one response. He doesn't critique online students and if he does, he talks about our photos for like a split second. He seriously doesn't care about the students or teaching us.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2013<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly recommend you don't take his class.  He spends 2 hours of class critiquing photos and it's SO BORING. If you want an easy A, take this course ONLINE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2013<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're honestly looking to improve your skills and you're an online student, don't take him. He tapes his in class lecture as the content, and sometimes doesn't even bother to critique online students. Doesn't respond to emails either. I could have learned all of this from a google search. Easy A, but do not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: IT228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel like any somewhat agile student could have taught this class better than "professor" Syrek. There is no foundation behind anything he tries to teach. In fact, I came out of this class feeling dumber than before. If you're looking to waste money on this class and get an easy grade, go for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Syrek is very nice. Class/homework are easy (storyboard assignment was worst). U need netflix cause hw is to watch assigned movies. Quiz each week. Read chapters each week. Final project is alot of fun (video-based). He hasn't seen movies like Avengers or Skyfall. Also has issue with posting hw on time. Takes him forever. Takes a while to respond.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2013<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Syrek grades subjectively & does not distribute feedback in a timely or fair manner. Unless photos are fantastic or terrible,students receive little to no indication of how/what to improve. Also does not respond to emails & fails to introduce crucial techniques & camera features until the midterm. Passionate about photography--not about teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2013<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this via on-line and i have to say that it was the hard because it was not my major. He makes it fun and challenging but was there to help me along the way. Piqued my interest for a film career. ;-) Nah, i will keep with Philosophy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2013<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>James was cool at the beginning, however he decided not to care after mid terms.  He wouldn't show up for class and when he did he would leave early.He graded pretty easy, but then started taking off for things we couldn't control.  I learned a lot about my camera, but also learned that I wouldn't take a class he teaches again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2012<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The work he assigns is reasonable. He grades easily. Class is usually let out early.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Alright teacher but is kinda hard on a class that is a non major course for everyone. Good intentions but doesnt potray is well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: DC202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Syrek is very clear about the assignments and gives adequate time to complete them.  His tests are mostly short answer and essay but are not bad as long as you study and pay attention in class. Attendance is extremely important and you will fail if you slack off. I got lucky and he gave me a C- when i should have received an F for missing clas</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intro. to screenwriting can be daunting if you've never done anything like it before, but James is extremely helpful and very kind. He says you will never watch movies the same again and it's true. If you have the opportunity to take this online you should.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2010<br>Class Name: DC104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for Intro to Screenwriting. I was expecting more creative freedom, but there is kind of a system you have to follow. VERY helpful in one on one, kind of repetative when talking to the class as a whole. Takes attendance seriously. Really interesting class though, never boring. Lets you leave early almost every class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: DC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took pre-production with James. He's a great professor. Easy projects. Easy grader. Sometimes there's a lot to do, but it never takes too long for homework. He is very inspiring and you want to go out and do great things after him. Take him. Easy A, fun, and you learn a lot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2010<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>5 projects.. all incredibly easy. James is a really easy grader too as long as you fulfill the requirements. Easy A-- highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes a GREAT prof. and i really really enjoyed his class! he is so fun especially if you get on his good side! he isnt too bad looking either ;)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2009<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very laid-back and monotonously funny.  We only had three assignments, a midterm and a final.  He liked to really help out with homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2009<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's pretty cool, but he does come off as bogus sometimes. I took him for digit photo. He starts out giving all the points, but later takes off for stuff that we have no control over. Overall he's cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2009<br>Class Name: DC105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would agree that for this class it was a little ridiculous for him to expect us to know how to use final cut pro. Its a class most take only for the SSMW requirement. Other than that, he is extremely HOT!!! So i didnt really complain about going to class and he is a good teacher overall. His methods are effective and you wont get bored in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>T his is not a point and shoot class, and it?s not as easy as it sounds. However, I loved it I loved the challenge and it was really fun. His goal is to make sure you learn something, and I learned allot. I would take him again if he had more classes, plus he?s not boring so that helps!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2008<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great class as an intro to photoshop, he grades each person on the extent of their abilities which was nice since people had a varying range of cameras. great intro class to digital still photog</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2008<br>Class Name: DC105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very nice teacher but expects way too much. He expected us to know how to make and edit movies when most people in the class were taking it just for the SSMW credit. The projects are kinda hard and the material can be difficult to understand. Even though he is a great person I wouldn't recommend the class.</div></div></div></body></html>
