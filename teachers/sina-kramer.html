She is not a hard grader, if you got a bad grade you probably were more concerned with passing the class than really learning the material. If you read, speak some in class, and take your papers seriously, you will do fine. She cares about her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such boring lectures. She talks about whatever she wants and has an extremely closed mind. If you're a guy forget it, you'll get a bad grade. She knows what she's talking about but doesn't listen to you unless you completely agree with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2010<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was clear during lectures, and enjoyed her bits of dry humor and wit. I didn't think she was bias as long as you made a good point in discussion. You have to do the readings to know what's going on. Only issue with the grading was that she didn't give reasons for point deductions (which drives me nuts). I enjoyed going to class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2010<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly she isn't that bad. She does give a breakdown for her papers which helps a lot. As long as you take notes in class you'll be fine. Her lectures are extremely dry and boring but she does have a sense of humor when she wants too. I'll take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2010<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Some of the comments were saying that she is a horrible teach but she really isnt that bad, and she gives you practice test that are very simular to actual exams. In my opinion the papers were harder than the test and there were only two papers. I got A's on all the test and a C on one of the papers and came out with a A-. I'd take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SUCH A HORRIBLE TEACHER. do not take this class. nothing makes sense...she ends up talking about random things that dont pertain to the readings. only 3 papers, but a hard grader. no final, which was nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, makes you think. Very clear on what she wants in the papers. Come on, who else will give you a page by page breakdown of how to write your paper&#63; She won't hand you your grade though, you have to take notes and pay attention. Overall a decent class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2008<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>terrible. do not take this class!!! homework is nothing but alittle reading, but HARD GRADER. much too hard on grading for a 100 course. she also accuses people of plagiarism for any little thing, so if u do take her don't even LOOK at any other material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2008<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is fun (considering it is philosophy we are talking about). U?ll have a good laugh during the class, while breaking your brain with fundamental masterpieces of philosophical thought.She'll help you make your mind more flexible so you won't injure it. Have fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2008<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She not a bad teacher at all. The material is boring and hard to read, but thats how most reading is. Just go to class, participate, put some effort into the papers and you'll do fine! She's a hard graders on the papers, but i got C's and bs on them and i ended up with an A- in the class. She really looks at the group project,so do good on that!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>overall this was a good class. just browse through the readings and she will explain them in depth. only exam was the midterm and the final paper which was not hard. two 3-page papers and thats it. why is everyone complaining&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For an introductory course, she really makes Phl difficult. Never a straight answer with this woman and discussion and participation are a must in her classes. Also she is a very hard grader on the papers and isn't very clear as to what she wants.  Came into class hung over pretty much most of the quarter and class was a waste of time.  Terrible!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice person but a very hard grader. Articles are very long and confusing. Tough grader!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2007<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice and relates to her students but she is a very hard grader.  You have to bring knowledge to the class or else you sit there not understanding a word she is talking about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2007<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not my cup of tea.  She does not effectively administrate class discussions, often seems to be uncertain of what she's saying, and structures the class around diconnected readings.  Case in point: the final paper was essentially a compare & contrast affair on John Locke and Simone de Beauvoir.  Not recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2007<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is extremely easy.  Two short papers, midterm, presentation, and final paper. 25% of grade is participation and she can be really unfair about that. It should be an easy A, if she likes you. If not you won't get the grade you deserve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2006<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED HER. holy cow--i came to class just to hang out with her. she's got the best wit--so funny. class consisted of 2 short papers, midterm, group presentation, and final research paper. pretty easy stuff--she lays out exactly what she's looking for. classes were all group discussion. easy! class ends next week...feel like i'm losing a friend...!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2006<br>Class Name: PHY101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's like having your best friend teach class. She's in her late 20's, and is hilarious. We have to write 4 papers, but you get at least a week to write each one, after we discuss the book in class for a week. No exams for Phylosophy 101- HIGHLY reccomend!Books are definately used.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>you people have to be illiterate to not get an a or b in her class. just do the following and youre fine: do the readings (6-7 pages per class, TOPS), spend more than just 2 hours when writing each paper (3 papers total, which are not hard when you do the readings and use spellcheck) and dont come to class hungover. pay attention, its philosophy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2006<br>Class Name: PHY100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher with interesting arguments and points. Very helpful and can be reached any time.

She's a very tuff grader, but she's always open to help you, by appointment of course. Overall, I think that she is a bit too biased for me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would say that kramer is a good teacher.  She is tough on grading papers but if you turn them in with a little work you wont get a bad grade.  She's pretty cool too, and funny sometimes.  Don't take the her class if you are offended by curse words though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's not an easy grader, but if you do your work, you'll get at least a B. Listen, take notes (even when other students are talking), DO the readings, turn assignments on time. She's very clear what she wants.  Basically, don't sleep (!) and take good notes (no book here), and you'll be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kramer is defiantly the worst professor I have had so far at DePaul. (I’m a sophomore as of posting this.) She picked philosophers of only certain viewpoints to review and even advocated a more select number of ‘em She is a very biased professor. And because I gave an alternative viewpoint to hers, she took it out on my grade.</div></div></div></body></html>
