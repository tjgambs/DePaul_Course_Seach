I never paid attention and I managed to get a B on both the midterm and final. Do the assignments because you get extra credit. He also allows a cheat sheet on tests, which are a lifesaver. Tests are easy and straightforward. I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2013<br>Class Name: MATH137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! Do not save your homework off for the last minute. Do it the week you are assigned the homework. He lets you turn everything in during the midterm and final for extra credit, and if you want that extra credit, do not save it until the last minute. You'll be up the whole night finishing it up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the most interesting subject, so I didn't pay attention most of the time, but he's a statistician so he knows what he's teaching and covers it in depth. Lets you have a cheat sheet for the exams. Overall a good guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class to get an A in. He explains everything crystal clear and double sided cheat sheet for the final and midterm. Take him !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2012<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just received my grade for last quarter, not going to lie quite disappointed. He rushes through the material way too fast and majority of classmates were typically in the library teaching each other the material because he doesn't teach very well. Tests were very challenging, would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kuziel goes through the material too quickly sometimes and the class is hard, but he allows a retake on the midterm and homework is extra credit. Not the best, but deff not the worst either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He wasn't the worst professor I've had by any means but he is very boring. I had him for a night class and it was rough. Also, he doesn't give you actual notes to write. He only does examples which can be really hard to learn from since Calc has a lot of rules. Only has two grades: midterm and final. I don't think I'll be taking him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dont understand why everyone said he's easy. he's awful at explaining the material. the homework counts for EC which is good, but honestly he is TERRIBLE at explaining. i taught myself everything it was awful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2012<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Kuziel was one of the best math teachers Ive ever had. If you do the homework, its not only extra credit for the exam, but a good grade on it allows you to RETAKE exams, including the final, if you bomb them. Attendance is graded. Projects got progressively harder but not overwhelming. He's a great teacher who has your best interest at heart.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2012<br>Class Name: MATH136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hw is extra credit and attached to Midterm and Final for 5pts. Cheat sheet allowed on exams. Attendance is also graded. Other than that, he is a great professor and really explains the material well. HW problems are more difficult than exams problems, but it doesn't hurt. He is ALWAYS willing to work with you and help you out. He allows retakes too</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher. hw is extra credit and is added on to the midterm and final. hes a very easy teacher so if u struggle with math like i do, then take him and you should do fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! He's really there to help students understand calc. Allows one page cheat sheet for tests. Midterm 1 & 2, final, and attendance, 25%,25%,40%,10% respectively. Barely studied and got a B in the course. Take him, tho he only teaches at night i thnk.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: MATH000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him for Business calculus 2. He truly is a great professor! Extremely helpful though the subject matter is tough. Gives points for Homework. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best math professor at DePaul. I recommend all students to take him. I got a 102% in the course. His exams are easy and it comes from the homework. Homework is worth 5 points which is added to your exam score. He let's the class use a sheet of paper with notes for the exams, so that made things a lot easier.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING PROFF!! the best math prof i ever had.

He let's you out early sometimes and is very helpful, it's almost impossible to not get an &quot;A&quot;. He teaches the information very well and review guides are very helpful. Also offers extra credit and make up exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2009<br>Class Name: BMS136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2009<br>Class Name: BMSBMS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teach is the best!!!! His teaching is soo crystal clear. I have always hated math until now! Lets you retake bad exams! which shouldn't be necessary because he is so damn good at at teaching! I got 103% in the class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2009<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher.Lets you retake your midterm/final if you do miserably. But the midterm/final are exactly like your study guide so you should never do badly. The excel projects are really easy as long as you pay attention. Gives extra credit for turning in all your homework. I wish Kuziel taught more than just Statistics. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2007<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was an awesome teacher. He introduced Excel into the curriculm (which I could've done without) But overall he is helpful and willing to pass you when he see that you have made an honest and sincere effort. Take him if Math really isn't your thing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy. knows his stuff and helps you out when you need it.

He makes the material understandable. Very nice and helpful. Goes over the homework in detail and gives plenty of examples. Reviews everything that will be on exam no surprises</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is by far one of the best professors i have ever had. He knows his stuff!! He is goofy and can be messy but his examples are perfectly clear as long as you are attentive. You will, however, have to read the book if you want to be proficient in the subject. Take it from a student who got an exceptional grade. Awesome at both 125/126</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best professors I've had. He's extremely helpful and is an easy grader. The homework is not mandatory, but if you complete it you will get the option of taking the midterm exam a second time with a minor penalty(5-10 points off depending how you did the first time). He also uses the homework to boost your borderline grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Kuziel was great.  Didn't really teach by the book, but most of the material was very easy.  You definetly need to look over the chapters to understand some of the material.  I did very little of the homework and looked over the chapters before the midterm and final and ended up with a solid A.  Gives 3 Excel projects to do, which aren't bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful Teacher... gives 10 percent for attendance... 45 percent for midterm and the same for the final- allows cheat sheets. The only compliant is at times his examples are disorganized and he brings out new formulas in middle of examples which can be confusing and his handwritting gets sloppy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The final exam is IMPOSSIBLE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just Awesome.
