Just not a good teacher. He is very unclear and he is very hard to understand. We bought 5 textbooks for class and did not open up 4 of them. I really did not learn anything in this class but thats alright i did learn a few pointers that i will use in my class one day.... other then that the class is pointless.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: LSE101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2007<br>Class Name: SCG000<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is absolutely unprofessional! He does not respond on questions, he is unfair, his comments are agressive, and only his opinion counts.  I did not learn anything but how a teacher should NOT be! He even failed to respond on reports filed by students after the course. He intimidates, he curses, and he is an absolute big head!</div></div></div></body></html>
