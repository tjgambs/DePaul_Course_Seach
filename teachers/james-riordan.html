I signed up for it as a Catholic Studies class, and it turned out it was very much non-denominational, which was not what I was looking for. He gave long ranting diatribes about the proper use of grammar, even though we were WAY behind in the lectures. There were also a ton of in-class writing assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2007<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The other comment is BS - he was great -easy goin and worth taking - e enjoys what he teaches.
