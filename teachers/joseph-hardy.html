Sometimes he didn't even change the numbers. If you have any knowledge of using the internet to help you with math, you should get at least a B+. Everything is open book, open note. Easiest math class ever; I wish I took him for 135.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't look at the class, makes you take pictures of the notes he writes on the board, doesn't understand the concept of technology, weighing grades or cumulative tests, and he is just plain awful. Made my experience in Business calc horrible. I worked my ass off to get my grade and a lot of people cheated off me so they could then get theirs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>This dude might be the worst teacher ive ever had, he is no smarter than the dumbest kid in the class, and doesnt know how to weight grades. I got 100 on all his tests and somehow managed to get a B in the class. This guy should not be teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>open book, open notes on test. hardy is the best option for calc in depaul he is an odd prof he doesnt know how to teach, and is brilliant. My advice ask him for the problems that will come on the test before hand, learn them and you will do good in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY. You will learn absolutely nothing from this class. I'm hoping to even pass. All his notes are written out in words instead of numbers and when you get home you need to teach yourself all the material. His tests are open note and open book, but this did not even help. If you want to actually learn something, take someone else!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't expect to leave with a higher knowledge of calculus, but this class is so easy. Open note, open book, open phone. I would recommend if you don't really care about being good at calculus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: MAT135136<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A! Lets you use notes and doesn't notice if you work together. If you learn outside of class with people who understand, you will do fine. Learning from his notes will get you no where.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2011<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want an easy A, take this class. He writes in chalk, and doesn't even look at the class the whole period. People sign in and leave, and he doesn't say anything. If you have no idea how to do precalculus I recommend that you don't take this class because you won't learn anything. Everything is open book, and open note.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2011<br>Class Name: CALC135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher, writes with both hands and covers the board. he teaches himself and not the students. he is not clear and not helpful at all. I will recormend not taking this man for any maths class cause you are guaranteed failiure in your carrer path.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hardy is crazy, but hilarious. Really, really easy all tests are open notes and open books and almost all of the questions on the final are taken from the book. Only take him if you are able to take him again for MAT 136 because you don't actually learn anything, but he's an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2011<br>Class Name: CALC136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you haven't take Calculus before do not take him he won't teach you anything! But if you have like I did there is no point of going to class which was nice! All exams are open notes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: MATH135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He writes pretty small so sit up front. When he grades your test he will draw red marks all over your paper. Make sure that you have room on your paper when you solve a problem because if you put one answer on the front and one on the back you will get marked wrong.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Will not learn anything from this class. The only reason I got through it was because I had taken Calculus before. Writes small and writes in full sentences whatever comes out of his mouth. Only good thing is that all tests are open note and final is open book and open note.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE teacher. doesn't know how to use a calculator so he explains how to find limits by drawing arrows. failed his class. when i retook it with a different teacher i received an A. AVOID him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Writes extremely small on the board and over explains everything. Yeah some might think its nice that hes showing you all possible ways to get to an answer but if calculus is not your strong suite you'll soon get lost easily. Your allowed to use notes on tests but if you can't read his writing you'll have to teach yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst class ever taken. I LOVE math, but he made me hate his class. Writes on the board so you can't read it, doesn't know how to explain stuff in ways of the 20th century. I am SO upset I took this class and YOU shouldn't consider him either! BEWARE! HORRIBLE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE. KNOWS THE SUBJECT, BUT HAS NO IDEA HOW TO TEACH IT. NOT EASY AT ALL BECAUSE YOU ARE COMPLETELY SCREWED FOR YOUR NEXT MATH CLASSES. WILL LEARN NOTHING FROM HIM. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GREAT AT MATH, BUT I ALMOST FAILED THIS CLASS BECAUSE OF HIM. DO NOT TAKE. STAY AWAY! WASTE OF TIME, WASTE OF MONEY, WASTE OF A CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Solid teacher. He describes everything and moves at a slow pace so EVERYONE can understand. Since he works like this class can sometimes be boring. You can use your notes on the test. Easiest A in math ever and you will learn the material easily. I never even did practice problems outside of class. Does write very small on the board.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Couldn't disagree more. The guy will literally spend a good portion of time to give you all steps necessary to solve a problem, even the obvious ones just to make sure. He's willing to answers your qustions when you have any and as said earlier, he'll go over h.w solutions on board step by step so you won't fail his exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best math teacher I've had so far. Don't know why he gets negative reviews. Your grade consist of 4 exams, ALL OPEN NOTES so you wont have to worry about memorizing formulas. Test problems are taken from hw problems and he'll tell you which ones. H.W not mandatory but again itll help for exams, goes over solutions in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2009<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an old school teacher who is totally against any type of technology. He makes math problems seem ten times harder than they are, is very forgetful which causes him to be very repetitive and he writes so tiny on the board so you better get to class early to get a seat in the front row. He doesn't prepare you well for the final, either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: BMSS135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>basically if you need help outside the classroom he will not make an appointment with you. he was only available fridays so good luck with that! i tried teaching myself after asking him for help outside of class didnt work... i put a lot of time in the class but still failed, since math is not the easist subject... good luck whoever takes him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GO HARDY! Seriously guys, his tests are just like the hw problems and he HELPS students during tests.Takes breaks in the middle of class. When announcing test material hes always like &quot;you know what lets make this easy&quot; and tells you what problems to do. Final exam is directly from the book and the problems are given in advance! TEXAS profesrs rule</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dont know what the this person is talking about. I got an A in his class and all i did was text and sleep. He does everything step by step and he gives fair test. Maybe if they payed attention to him and asked for help they would do good. He is very nice if you talk to him and he does curve tests if he sees that many didnt do good</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nobody understood what he was doing, the class is easy but somehow he makes it hard. Had to learn the whole class by the book by myself. Atendance is mandatory but most people just come to sign in and leave.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
