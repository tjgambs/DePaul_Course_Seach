Class is quite hard, but if you pay attention in class and do the homework, you should do fine. She has so much knowledge about the subject, and she is more than willing to help her students. She is also very kind and understanding in her classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2012<br>Class Name: GEO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a wonderful professor. Period. Loved this class and I loved the topic. She is also just a really smart cookie and a pleasure to listen to. She is kind to her students and encouraging.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2012<br>Class Name: GEO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Breitbach is overall just a good professor. Very clear, shows enthusiasm and energy, and makes sure to welcome you to the department (if you are taking this for the GEO major that is). The lectures cover complicated earth processes, but she always managed to explain things with clarity. I only wish that it was more in-depth and challenging</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2008<br>Class Name: GEOG360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Breitbach is and was extremely informative. She is very passionate and focused at her craft. I've enjoyed her very much. By the way, i attend Chicago State University the place where Dr. Breitbach is needed the most.We love u man!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: GEO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class was interesting to me and as long as you did what you were assigned you could walk away with a very good grade.  She was incredibly nice and accomodating.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: GEO170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like her as a person and teacher. She holds people to a standard and respects the department she represents. She teaches well enough where you still pass a test without studying. &quot;A CLASS ACT&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2005<br>Class Name: GEO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too muc hinformation for an intro class, uses ppt and first half of quarter i thought i had carpel tunnel second half started giving handouts off ppt notes so that helped. 2 exams, a few pop quizzes, mini project, and a 3 page paper. I didn't really try but got a B+ in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2005<br>Class Name: GEO<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took environmental conservation, and while it was hard, i don't think it was anything that was too hard for a college class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2004<br>Class Name: GEO101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst class Ive even taken. There is so much information, you are pretty much memorizing the entire textbook. She is extremely hard on her tests and is a hard grader on papers. Required to know WAY too much for an intro class. Save yourslef from the misery and do not take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: GEO101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class what the hardest class I have been in at DePaul since freshman year and the funny thing about this is that it is a intro class. She expects us to know way too many notes, you practically rewrite the whole text. She is the most boring teacher I have ever had. My advice would be, DON'T TAKE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2004<br>Class Name: GEO<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had to take way too many notes. Felt like i was rewriting the book during class. Luckily she started giving out outline handouts. Her tests are hard and expects too much for an intro class-also gives pop quizzes. Wouldn't recommend her, but not terrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2004<br>Class Name: GEO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had to take a lot of notes during class. Tests were hard. She was very knowledgeable of the subject matter and very helpful if needed. She could be a looker if she cleaned herself up and tried a little more.</div></div></div></body></html>
