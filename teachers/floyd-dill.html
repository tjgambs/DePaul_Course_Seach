    The instructor needs to change the style of teaching. This is probably the worst class I ever had as far the material and the professor. Two exams (50% each) and attendence is a must. Please be prepared to take this class. This is a very hard class. This is the lowest grade I have ever had.

    Out of all my DePaul experience, he was the worst. There are way better teachers to take for any Economics course, take him as a last result.

    He is really old...never really veers from the book...straight lectures everyday and a lot of note taking....subject could have been interesting if a video or anything other than our dry book was used...but other than that....usually straightforward in assignments and tests....he will typically give u the questions of midterm and final before exam.

    NOT GOOD!  he makes you learn on your own, and he expects you to know a lot.  good luck with him.  it's pretty much teaching yourself in the class.  if you don't read, you'd get SO behind.

    WORSE TEACHER EVER, I only get A's and B's and I had to drop his class bc his midterm sucked, if you like 50% midterm and 50% final then take it but if you fail the midterm, u are screwed.  Does not care about students all he cares about are his carribians trips on his boat.

    Professor Dill is the most hilarious professor at DePaul.  He yelled at us for not answering questions which was funny, because most of the time he is monotone.  The exams were easy and straightforward.  He was really funny.

    Knows his stuff, but doesn't care if his students know it.  Talks MONOTONE.  The most boring class I ever took.  You have to teach yourself; be prepared to READ on your own.  Tends to go on and on and on.  Take him at your own risk!!!

    Professor knows his stuff. Not sure whether or not he cares if the students know it. Will try to clarify as much as possible but wont go too far out of his way. Loves economic graphs. He has a slight southern accent and his partially deaf in both ears. Speak loudly.

    DO NOT TAKE THIS MANS CLASS!!! I dont know why this man wont just go ahead and retire! I have never experienced anything so BORING! His monotone voice will put you to sleep,which makes learning anything impossible. This mans class is horrible dont take it! the only way you'll learn is to read the book word for word.

    I'm a personal fan of this guy.  He is kind of like a great uncle Bob that always makes ridiculous jokes that crack you up... if you don't understand him, read the book (like he tells you to do anyway).  Definately not a bad class if you put in a little bit of effort.

    Professor Floyd gives NO homework, but a Mid-term (40%) and final (60%) and they're extremely hard and the questions are not deceiving, but requires you to think. he's very affectionate, tries to use big words and changes' his tone of voice to look professional. He has NO interest in students.

    HE IS NOT A HARD TEACHER!!! he has an 11 point curve in his class, which makes it hard not to do well. he gives practice quizzes, which really help. attendance is optional, which is good because he can be very boring, but cracks an occasional joke. but i repeat, HE IS NOT A HARD TEACHER!!

    Dill does not care if your family member dies (in my case, my father). He gave no support or extra support. He is very harsh and boring. Don't expect anything good from him. Good class if you don't like doing homework and 100% finals. Enjoy!

    Good God, terrible beyond belief!  The class itself is not too hard, but the only thing HE did was confuse me.  Just read the book and don't show up for class, because it's useless. Curves the final (60%) and mideterm (40%).

    His way of teaching is very confusing.  I didn't learn that much from his lectures. He is boring and talks in a quiet voice all the time. He gives minimum examples of how the economy works. He knows so much but can't get it across to students. His midterm is 40% and final 60%

    This class is sooooooo boring. I have probably gone to a total of 6 classes the whole quarter. He breaks down his class by doing 40% midterm and 60% final.  His test aren't too bad becuase he gives the answers to some questions before the test. All you have to do is read the book and you are fine.

    He is very boring but funny sometimes.  He curves tests.  take decent notes and read the book somewhat. If you want to get an A, skim over the book before class then read it again a before the tests. Try and go to most of the classes too if you want a good grade.

    So what, he looks like the monopoly guy, if that will keep you awake take this class.  He is very boring and sometimes makes mistakes, (Double check GDP notes) but the midterm was easy with a nice curve. It's not hard to pass, just hard to be inetersted.

    The old man needs to retire, the good thing is that there is no homework, so he grades on your mid-term and finale. Thats IT !! and both are very hard, he does not review for any of the test, therefore he will failyou, like me. He is not reasonable or mercyful, even if you talk to him.

    BORING lecturer, but overall a pretty easy course.  Gave us questions to midterm/final before we took it, let us bring notes for both tests.  Easy A

    Yes he looks like monopoly man, quirky, but MAN IS HE BORING! I didn't learn much. I would not recommend him.  Take Batavia or Oppenhiemer.
