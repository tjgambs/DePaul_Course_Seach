Yes, he gives long lectures but he knows his stuff. You must be interested in the topic that he lecturing.

If you get feedback from Dr. Udoh, prepare for a serious lack of helpful or constructive criticism. 56 of my class dropped off by end of quarter. He's a published researcher, but a terrible teacher. Good luck. You've been warned.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2014<br>Class Name: LL155<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No positive feedback, inconsistent instructions, unresponsive to students questions, does not offer explanations to questions asked.
