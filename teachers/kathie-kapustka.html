I worked my butt off on the final project (week-long lesson plan), along w/the 3-4 long observation papers, and endless group work.  Avoid taking at the same time as other heavy work load classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2007<br>Class Name: EDU413<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Liked the in class group worj but there is lots of work and grading for attendance for this graduate level class seems inappropriate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2006<br>Class Name: TL409<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, it was an easy class, but it was a great class.  Dr. K taught us about classroom enviornments and actual teaching.  A great teacher and a great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2006<br>Class Name: TL409<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was never more bored in my life!  She talks too much, too much group work. The worst is  worked my butt off for the final project to realize fellow classmates who just copied stuff off the internet ot the same &quot;A&quot; I did.  What a joke.  I wish I could get my money back-anyone who thinks she was great probably is an idiot too..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2005<br>Class Name: TL409TL413<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Phenomenal. She has you work in groups to teach you methodologies as a teacher so you can use for YOUR students work in groups. She uses a Constructivists method, you learn by doing and exploring. Therefore you learn more. If you have a question she makes that part of the lesson/learning for the next week. Very flexible. Wish I could take her again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2004<br>Class Name: TL409<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For this graduate elementary education course, I expected better from a Ph.D.  Too much busy work and way too much group work inside the class.  And, attendance is part of her grade so watch out.</div></div></div></body></html>
