You HAVE to carry the book to class with you every day, tests are on material she didn't cover in class, and this class takes up the majority of my time, but I have the LOWEST GRADE in this class out of all my classes.. Every other section has it WAY easier wtf</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2012<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not exactly sure who wrote the first comment but it is not true. This class was OKAY. The amount of effort needed in this class was a LOT. You need the book to do good on the midterm and final. No extra credit. Homework is online which is also time consuming. Be ready to do a lot of work. Not an easy A what so ever. Ms David is knowledgeable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2012<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. Her lectures managed to keep me intrigued. Always had an in class example to reinforce concepts. Gave curves on both exams. We ALWAYS got out 15-45 minutes early. She's to the point. Unfortunately, homework is done on MyOMLab, which can be extremely tedious and time consuming. Don't buy a book, you won't ever need it.</div></div></div></body></html>
