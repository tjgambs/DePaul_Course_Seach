He is so unbelievably helpful and knowledgeable in the field. I learned more in his class than any other film course I've taken over the span of two years.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2012<br>Class Name: DC310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dan Klein is a great professor who has a genuine interest in developing DePaul's Digital Cinema program and helping all the young aspiring filmmakers in his class. If you have to opportunity to take a class with him I highly recommend it. He doesn't BS and gives you the opportunity to push yourself as a filmmaker on a professional level.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2012<br>Class Name: DC388<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dan Klein is what every professor should be: well-versed in the subject, inspiring, and willing to be there for his students. Because of this, his excellent character, & infectiously enthusiastic personality, he is one of the best professors at DePaul. You should take him as much as you can. Your life and what you learn will be of higher quality.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2010<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Learned more than I did in any other class in the program.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2009<br>Class Name: DC210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dan Klein is easily my favorite professors at DePaul.  He makes time to help his students.  His class is challenging. Especially if you push yourself to do good work.  His production one course is hands down far superior to any other offered at DePaul where you range anywhere from 7-9 projects.  (others have 2 tops which is depressing.)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2009<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was going to be an Art major but I changed my mind because of him. He doesn't know what he's talking about and he makes me sleep with the PS he keeps saying. Unorganized, confusing, and show us dummy movies. He seems nice and gentleman but he will make you pay the price for his unclarity on things...if you can make a B then you must be the lucky!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2008<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Klein is absolutely the best. He makes class so interesting you will not want to miss it! He pushes all of his students to do their best and is always there to help. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2008<br>Class Name: DC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Klein's class is great. He is very sincere and shows a great deal of care for his students and their projects. He will bend over backwards to help you and constantly tries and brings people in to class who have professional experience. He hates wasting time and unnecessary assignments, which makes his class even better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2007<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Totally fresh. He's actually doing it, not just talking about it, so it felt like he knew what he was talking about.  I think he should bring more stuff from his work to the class, but I know he didn't want to focus on himself.  He brought the director of Airplane in and that was awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2007<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome.  Made writing fun. Really respectful and sincere.  Definitely take his class if he teaches here again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2007<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard working, intelligent, and pushed us to do our best.  As difficult as writing was/is for me, he inspired me and made me feel fearless.  I would take Prof. Klein for any class he happened to be teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite profs ever.  I thought he was extremely funny and made class entertaining and enjoyable.  He really put his all into the class despite how busy he is with his own projects... I wish my classmates had done the same.  Klein brings a unique perspective to the DC program, and I highly recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: DC210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Klein is super easy, yet entertaining.  He is a goofy guy, and says hilarious things under his breath.  He is one of the easiest teachers I have ever taken.  The midterm was a breeze and the papers are fun... Great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2006<br>Class Name: DC270<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Topics in Comedy prof.  Not funny at all.  To him, it's all about numbers and names- no theory, no discussions.  Midterm was almost all memorizing dates, names and films.  He is afraid to say anything slighly objectionable.  There was no mention of any &quot;topics&quot; of comedy- it was basically a history class. papers were way too hard,unclear,irrelevent</div></div></div></body></html>
