I took her LSP class and she makes the class. She doesn't believe in grades so it's an easy pass class. However, she does get off topic a lot and struggles with equipment, which can be very funny. As long as you have a positive attitude you'll enjoy the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RJ is the best professor you will ever have.

Myself and four other students in her class were singled out every class and she did not value our opinions whatsoever.you will want to run out of the class ten minutes in once you realize that you have 4 hours to go. She keeps you late after the four hours and don't get home till 4:30. She's extremely rude</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2012<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RJ is the best teacher I have ever had. She truly has a good heart. Although she is easily distracted which bothers some people, but if you go into her class with an open mind and positive attitude you will enjoy it. I suggest checking out the books for class from the library. Take her class if you can, it's an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Prof. RJ's class. She has one of the best personalities; she is really funny and easily distracted which I think is adorable. She is very sweet and the only way to get on her bad side is to 1. miss class 2. talk too much during class when others are talking or 3. turn in crap for work or don't turn in anything at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE HER CLASS. She is the cutest, sweetest old lady ever and she really cares about her students. She's very social and gets off-topic easily, but usually that topic can be related back to whatever it is we're doing in class. Would definitely take another class with her if she taught more than first-year program stuff!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RJ is such a sweet lady and great professor.  She is very wise and truly cares about each and every student and helps them reach their fullest potential.  She made the class fun and interesting and struck an interest of the subject of Jewish Culture that I wold not have had before taking this course.

You sit in a circle and just talk the entire time. If you are opinionated and not shy this is perfect. the work was minimal. write about personal experiences to do well. you have to read some novels that can all be found on spark notes. she's a really weird but interesting lady.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2010<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RJ is a decent professor. She genuinely cares for her students. I do think she is a bit scatterbrained though. I felt like the class was fun and we always had a great experience, but when it came down to doing the assignments I had NO clue on what she expected. It was a bit challenging..but would recommend otherwise</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2009<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RJ is awesome! I've only had 2 classes with her so far this year in my Chicago quarter but I love it. She is extremely chill about everything, and for someone who is 96 she has a great sense of humor. She does tend to go off on tangents but thats what makes the class enjoyable. She is extremely helpful, and a great prof to have.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely crazy.

She may not teach you what you expect to learn in the course you are taking, but having R.J. is truly an experience you should have.

She goes off on tangents like its her job and  she seems very disorganized.  weekly logs are due and on the plus side you watch a lot of movies.  Shes kinda strange, but not hard.
