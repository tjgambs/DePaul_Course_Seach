Cannot teach, don't understand her vague comments. Main problem, she expects you to know much more than you do and then speaks on things that had nothing to do with the homework in my math lab. She has not given one smart real life math example the entire class though constantly tries. BORING TOO! Avoid at all cost!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2013<br>Class Name: MAT100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In a nutshell: I basically taught myself in mymathlab, barely went to class (didn't need to really), and overall the teacher was nice and helpful. If you want to learn something, don't take the class, if you want an easy A, I highly recommend this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2013<br>Class Name: MAT100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Profesor Bouagnon is an awesome teacher, take her if you have the chance. she lets you use any tools you can find on the web and is very helpful. Also she is very fun to have in class. The only bad thing about her is that she is horrible at responding to emails</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2013<br>Class Name: MAT95<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best math class ever. She let us retake the midterm and any quiz or test we want. Don't buy textbook! It is all on mymathlab but it is seriously so easy, her harder courses are the same because I've taken them too! She is a nice lady and has a very different approach to math</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2012<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So far, ive taken 3 math courses with her. She is the nicest lady ever. All of the courses were on MML which was a bit annoying, however, she does accomodate if you are a bit behind or want to take a quiz again.Just put in an honest effort and you'll do fine. There was no textbook as such. Hope to take her again. Thanks for everything ms b!.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2011<br>Class Name: LSP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Thia professor is amazing! She is the nicest person ever. She really cares about her students and wants everyone to do well. She is extremely helpful. I am horrible in Math and managed to get 100% on the final. Mathlab is annoying and time consuming but she gives plenty of time to get all the work done. Highly recommend her as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2011<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was very friendly, interesting, and helpful. She always offered many opportunities for help outside of class. Mathlab was the only type of homework we had, which was very frustrating at times, and a lot of work, but easy to get a good grade on since you could redo the homework. Midterm and final were easy if you kept up with the homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2010<br>Class Name: MAT100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While MyMathLab is extremely frustrating and this professor didn't quite -teach-, she was still really helpful if you were nice to her and asked her to change your grade when you slipped up in MML.  She was very generous, and that made up for her incapability to structure her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2009<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So annoying. My Math Lab is so useless, you don't learn anything from it and that's what she uses for instruction, homework, and quizzes. She's a nice lady, and wants everyone to do well, but I don't feel like I learned anything in her class. Extremely easy, so if you're not concerned with actually learning anything, this is the class for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2009<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this professor twice----SOO EASYYY...but if you struggle with math-she is not the teacher for you..barely explains the material--and its a mathlab so even if there were any due dates--just bs and she'll change it for you---but overall AWSOME TEACHER__really nice!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2009<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice lady but the class is frustating. She goes over the same stuff but expects us to know all of the new stuff too. I'm teaching myself everything. The material is fairly easy but I hate having to show up to a class when we don't learn anything new.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: WRC104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While she tries to be helpful, its is quite difficult to understand her.  The materiel is EXTREMELY easy, and every class crawled by at a glacial pace.  She has odd illustrations for easy mathmatical concepts, and she appears to be incapable of the math that she is teaching.  Overall I would recommend that NO ONE take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, annoying teacher. i got an A+ and felt like I was still in 8th grade in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I cannot believe this woman is allowed to teach. Not only can nobody understand her, but she doesn't really COVER any material fully, just goes off on tangents. The presentation was useless. She was gone for the last three classes and another prof subbed for her, I learned more from him in a day than her in a whole quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was placed in this math by accident and struggled in the class because it was a waste of time to be there because I understood the concepts. Prof.  was always very easy to approach and she really does try to help every kid in class. Plus, she always gives extensions on every assignment and you can take quizzes over times if you really want!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Man do I hate math.  But I actually started learning simple concepts that I failed to learn in high school.  She was a really nice lady and brought in her husband's father who is an african king and saw snow for the firs time in Chicago (and left his tribe for the first time!).  It was crazy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2007<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She started off seeming like she would be a great teacher if you tend to struggle in math, but she isn't. I had to teach myself the majority of concepts out of the book because she goes off on tangents that have nothing to do with the material. She is a nice person, but not a good teacher if you need spoon fed material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2007<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher overall. Sometimes its hard to understand what shes talking about and she will make people go up to the board when they don't want to but she will help you if you need it. I liked her alot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2007<br>Class Name: MAT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is an easy class with an easy professor.

Honestly, she is a great math prof. becuase she relates math to things happeneing now. We had a PP presentation that helps out your grade, very small EASY quizes and mid. term/take home/final. they are fairly easy. Doesnt tak attend. - TAKE HER!!!!! TRUST ME!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2007<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT TEACHER!! very clear, and helpful. She is funny and has a great sense of humour. She is really leniant and wants kids to get good grades. She will allow re-do's. She never gets mad. Though she might sometimes say some random comment that does not relate to anything, it all adds to her humour. SHE IS WONDERFUL!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2007<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AZAMING! If ur a closeminded, lzy student dont take this course. Prof. is engaging w/a dry witty humor. For those who have scored this prof low, they must have not come to class, &/or didnt do the work. I have always been the student who failed math, or kept dropping out of the course-i never been good at math until i took this course with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2006<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrbile Teacher!

Val is a good teacher who is always willing to help her students. Yes, her accent is a bit tough to understand and she uses her own&quot;nominclature&quot; but if u put in the effort n stick out the class, you'll do fine. Go to class, she will get pissed if your never there and WILL dock your grade..

She is very good at teaching calculus. She really wants you to do well and will do anything to make sure you learn the material. She is very accomodating. The key is to do all your homework and go to her for extra help. She really makes math make sense and interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sometimes her accent got in the way of her teaching. In every class that I went to she would make random comments connecting math to everyday things... like boats and refridgerators. But she always let you resubmit class work. The projects she makes you do are pointless.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: BMS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: MTH130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought this was a very easy class.

She has a french accent! She brought her father-in-law from africa to class once and all we did was ask him questions while she translated cuz all he knew was french!  She lets you re-submit homework if you get anything lower then a 100 and practically gives you answers on the quizzes.

On the final, she actually gave hints so that you could get the right answer. She does everything short of give you the actual answers.
