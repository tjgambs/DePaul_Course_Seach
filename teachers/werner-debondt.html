Previous comments right on. Assigns grades per a bell curve. Only gives out X # of A's (2% of class size), maj. B's. I was in a class with a former CFA Banker) and PhD (Economics). Classes small (9 or so), so A's are tight. Asked what I could have done differently to get an A, told me nothing/ my responses were perfect.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2010<br>Class Name: FIN582<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>50% of grade is participation, but no discussion, becomes competition to say something so he knows your name - he was still making name mistakes in wk 10 - kind of alarming when 50% of the grade's participation.  Grading on the MT & Final are redic.  Forced normal distro & no curve.  Papers are all dated and a good chunk had horrible econometrics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2009<br>Class Name: FIN582<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring and dull.  Like someone else said, the professor gives you a ton of articles to read and expects you to remember everything little detail.  He wrote some of them so don't contradict his findings.  If he doesn't like your answer he will tell you.  Werner has an ego.  Probably one of the most meaningless classes I have ever taken.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2009<br>Class Name: FIN583<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy and knows the material by heart, but the class is dull as can be.  Gives you 30+ articles and expects you to learn ~200 terms.  Grades the mid-term and final tough, 76 was an A on the mid-term, 57 a B, so there is a huge curve.  Take something else, really was a waste of money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2006<br>Class Name: FIN583<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you enjoy reading long, dry articles this class if for you. 50% of the grade is discussion, except any time you talk he puts down what you say. He's a nice guy overall, but the class is not worth taking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Debondt is absolutely brilliant.  It takes a while to get used to his presentation style.  His reading material is loaded with statistics.  He wants you to be prepared for class, read the papers twice, Interesting stuff.  He's an easy grader because he is looking for you to think and apply.  If you only memorize than you will not like him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2005<br>Class Name: FIN582583<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I've had at DePaul and the most interesting classes.  Somewhat stats-centric, but you can get by easily enough. 1/2 of your grade is in-class discussion, the other half is a comprehensive final, but no papers/homework. Read academic papers & discuss in class. Very clear expectations.</div></div></div></body></html>
