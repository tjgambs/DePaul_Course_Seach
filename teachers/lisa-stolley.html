Class time spent on discussion of essay topics & writing styles.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2003<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's definitely a feminist, but her class is pretty interesting.
