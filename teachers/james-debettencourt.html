Talks like everyone is as knowledgeable as him. AWS sucks ask questions intermediately, and go to office hours he will help you with assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2015<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I've ever had. He really has a passion in the subject, and quite literally sparked my interest in network security!!! Sometimes unclear, but makes up for it with his awesome personality, and willingness to help out. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>This class is interesting and Debettencourt is an interesting guy. The assignments are easy because he does them all in class and he usually gives A's on most of the assignments and he isn't strict on due dates. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor. I enjoyed this class, especially since Im a IT major, so I learned a lot about networking.  Long (kind of) boring class lectures. Ask questions if your confused about assignments!!! He will show you how to do it in class! Overall kind of confusing at times, good teacher, Easy assignments, but time consuming. Got an A. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: GPH259<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>This class is Design Geometry, I took it because of the lab requirement for scientific inquiry but its mostly working with math (geometry) and computer programs for design. So its a lot easier than trying to fulfill that requirement with Bio or Chem! Super easy grader, too. Even though I'm not a DC student, I am expecting a good grade in this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2014<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Debettencourt might not be a very clear Professor but he knows the subject well. He is a great guy tho. He is always finding ways to help every student and make sure they know what is going on. Go to his office hours and he clears up everything. I will take him again for another class.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2014<br>Class Name: IT373<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like him as a person but not as a prof. Very accessible to see outside of class, which is necessary because he doesn't explain assignment instructions well in class. Disorganized and boring lectures but he is passionate about computers and I appreciated that. Very accommodating and helpful if you have questions or need help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Debettencourt falls in that category of professor that knows his subject, is a nice person, and is poor at communicating. If you turn everything in, which is pretty much all due at the end of the term, you'll get an A with an attempt. He's there if you need to talk to him, and you might because his lectures are painfully boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class as a requirement for Computer Science. Teacher is very nice and he is smart but his lectures are so boring and therefore difficult to follow. Homework isn't due until end of quarter. Very disorganized. Goes off on tangents frequently.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He means well and cares about the students' education.  You WILL either fall asleep in his class or end up browsing the internet for the entire class period.  I mean, its not the most interesting subject and he isn't the most entertaining, but if you can focus really well, take him.  If not, you'll fall behind.  Overall, easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2013<br>Class Name: ECT250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty decent class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely easy but can be boring.he does use attendance as a grade.simple hw assignments. I didnt really learn anything beside what AWS is. the final could be a bit confusing but its step by step and you can do it as a class. sometimes he would just correct it for you. if you want an easy A take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2013<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is very smart and helpful, when you ask for help. Homework is not difficult because you are allotted a lot of time to complete the assignments. Exams are extremely easy and he is a fair grader! I recommend his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2012<br>Class Name: ECT310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simply terrible...went off on tangents for a good 20 minutes on stuff totally unrelated to class.  Very unstructured as far as lectures, homework assignments, and final - very vague. Rarely answers email and doesn't grade anything or give feedback. Will definitely avoid taking him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2012<br>Class Name: ECT310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the worst teachers I've ever had.  He was totally unprepared for class - talked about whatever the guy in the last row asked questions about.  This class was total AGONY and I was so looking forward to taking this class.  Do the assignments - you have an A. Don't expect to learn anything though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2012<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What everyone says is true - yeah, he's easy and really nice, but I guarantee you won't learn a single thing from this class. And if you're at all interested in learning, then going to this class will be miserable. He tends to ramble on a bit and will go off on a tangent quite fluently. Nice guy, just not really good at teaching :/</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is an easy A, do whatever he asks you to do, submit all 20 assignments and do easy 2 final take home and you get A easily. BUT, you won't learn beside some cool softwares and tools for network. He knows his stuff but too busy guy and class is disorganized. your text book is wikipedia.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was pretty disorganized with handling homework assignments and lectures tended to go off-topic a lot. He also tends to come across condescending if you don't get  certain topics down right away. If you like and understand computers, take him. If not, find a more compassionate teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2011<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor! He really cares for his students to understand the concepts and does not put so much attention to deadlines. He is passionate about computer science and I learned a lot from him. His lectures are boring, but he tries his best for his students to understand the topics being covered. Especially good for those with little knowledge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: ECT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring lecture! He doesnt prepare before class, half of the time he tried to figure out why the software is not working, better off watch the online record than going to class. Just do all the hw, you should be ok. If you are stucked with hw, google it. He doesnt answer his emails EVER. He does not grade anything until the end of quarter either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2011<br>Class Name: GPH259<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him! He is a great professor and is very passionate of the subject. His lectures are very boring, but you can bring a laptop to entertain you.  The labs are a little difficult, but there is someone there to help you. If you don?t understand something, professor will def assist you anyway possible. Very flexible</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2011<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor DeBettencourt is absolutely wonderful. He makes the computer concepts easy to understand and cares far more about your grasp of the concepts than he does about grades. He's also an incredibly nice person and is more than willing to help if you have any issues, which if you're like me, you will. Useful class, great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2009<br>Class Name: ECT250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this class, I learned a great deal. Professor D definitely knew his stuff. I wish more people were in my class though. Good guy, recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2006<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very EASY teacher, although I didn't learn much. Talks about alot of cool computer stuff, none of which has to do with web design. Learned a little bit in the class but not much. He's a cool guy though and it's an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The teacher is knowledgeable, but his class is a disorganized, waste of time.  Stream of conscious lectures are hard to follow and too boring. Whether or not you have any networking experience, don’t bother. This class is too unstructured for you to learn anything really useful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decent professor.  He's really nice.  However, for a security class we didn't learn much about security.  I dont think this is because of him - he seems to know what he's doing. I think its more because they wait to teach you the good stuff until grad school.  I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2005<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really great teacher, knows a ton about computers and is very good at explaining and helping you understand the topics.  Would definately take one of his classes again.</div></div></div></body></html>
