Our review sessions were not very effective and the days that he handed our tests back and reviewed the statistics of the questions and the most missed questions were not very effective either, very slow moving. He was decent, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2014<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Overall very easy class if you take notes in class. But he was a confusing professor students would ask questions and he would never directly answer the question. He left a lot up in the air. But as others said if you show up and take notes very easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: EVOLUTION<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Aguirre's class was pretty straight forward. The only hw we really ever had was the lab due once a week & maybe a few in class w.s here & there. He is pretty clear at explaining everything & things in the exam are taken from the powerpoints. Over all if you study for the exams you should do fairly well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2013<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what this other person was on when they wrote this review. Not only is he NEVER clear with explaining things, but he talks fast, relies on powerpoints and NEVER reviews material. Good luck doing well in this class, he makes it very difficult to pass. Oh, and the tests are IMPOSSIBLE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2012<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Just follow along in lecture and there is no need for the text. Absolutely recommended to anyone.</div></div></div></body></html>
