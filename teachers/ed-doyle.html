He would be a guy you would love to go grab a drink with after to pick his brain on the accounting world, but don't want to see him in your class. He talks more about his experience than teaching and the test is mostly AICPA adapted questions. Be careful taking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2015<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the best class. Doyle is a nice guy and knows his stuff but he spent more time talking about his family or his job than how to actually do the work. If you expect to learn anything, you'll have to teach yourself. If I had to retake the class, I would not take him again. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2015<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While he clearly knows his stuff, he is not good at presenting it. Did not learn a lot in his class from him, have to basically teach yourself. Tests are online, but is still unnecessarily difficult. Would not take again and would warn others to prepare to study outside to pass</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2015<br>Class Name: AUDIT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not recommend.....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2014<br>Class Name: 637<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Those who complain about having to read a few chapters on their own shouldn't be in grad school. Ed deviates from the PPT slides for good reason - to put things in a context. If you're looking for a prof to spoon feed you bullet points from a PPT and regurgitate the textbook, Ed isn't the one to do it. Read assignments like an adult + go to class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2014<br>Class Name: 637<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class got out early almost every time. Didn't go over slides for course material. He spend the time talking about himself or watching TedTalks. Very unprepared for midterm and final. Gave no help on any study guide questions. Basically have to memorize the text book to do well in the class. Don't take</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2014<br>Class Name: AUDCPAREVIEW<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His online audit CPA review class is engaging and interesting. I enjoyed his side comments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2014<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>You need that textbook and you will need to study hard. Use the textbook hmwrk answers he posts and be prepared for a tough test. The scores were well spread out. Lots of people did well. Some did not. You get what you put in. He basically just takes attendance and tells you what its like to be an auditor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2014<br>Class Name: ACC550<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worse class ever taken at DePaul. Took as an online course. Professor took days to respond to emails and does not monitor D2L questions. I considered contacting the Dean of Accounting to get a response. Gives a group project during finals week with little instruction. Do not take</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2014<br>Class Name: ACC550<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWFUL! You have to teach yourself this whole class. He talks about his career and barley talks about the material in class but classes are mandatory. He does not respond for a few days to your emails, he barley elaborates on the powerpoints that he provides, and he gives you a group project a like 4 days before its due. DO NOT TAKE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to teach yourself audit, go right ahead and take him but frankly, he wasn't very helpful and didn't explain material all that well. Everything is powerpoint and he barely elaborates on the power points as it is. DO NOT TAKE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2013<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material for this class is boring and the professor does his best to teach it and relate it to real life scenarios.  You will have to read the chapters thoroughly and do the homework to pass the tests because the information can be confusing. Doyle definitely wants his students to succeed which is a huge plus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2012<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have not learned a thing in his 2 audit classes. I only took him for the grade to boost my GPA. All the tests are online and if you can't get a better grade than a 90% you shouldn't be in college. One presentation which he uses to make himself appear smarter than students. Thankfully I learned audit by working in audit. He's useless.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2012<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be warned: Tests are not online anymore. His lectures are like watching paint dry. Nice guy but his arrogance is over powering. If you do the readings and study the HW you should be fine. Not the worst professor Ive come across but defiantly in that category.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2012<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendance is not mandatory. Midterm, final, presentation. The material he teaches is very dry and hard to hang on to. His stories are irrelevant to much of the material he is trying to teach. I felt as though I needed to teach myself for the class. Tests are online, but they are very tricky. I will not be taking him in the future.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2011<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendance is not required, the tests are online. Doyle is a great professor and very caring. My advice would be to go to class if you want an A, but if you don't go to class you can pull off an easy B. Funny guy too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2011<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the best Accounting 372 teacher. His tests are online... which means they are OPEN BOOK. How can you possibly fail&#63; No clue what's with the negative ratings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures can be boring especially on a Saturday morning for three hours. Once you do the hw and read the book it will not be too hard. I mean know the book. Midterm and Final are online HOWEVER, it is extremely detailed and answers can be very hard to tell apart (it's MC) It's frustrating how tedious the exams were.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT550<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Get a textbook and teach yourself.He almost doesn't teach much stuff.Only 10 classes in summer,2 for online exams, 2 for podcasts.You see him of 6 classes and one half of the class is presentation by students....Lazy and not quite responsible.Not recommend for his auditing calss!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2010<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Advantages of having Doyle: attendance and participation are not graded but he is the Jerry Seinfeld of accounting... with a lower voice. Expect to leave early. Disadvantages: lectures are more conceptual and anything goes for the tests (book or lecture). By now you should know that you must do the homework to get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked this professor, great sense of humor, midterm and final are online, 1 quiz only, quiz was easy, tests not so much, but its a take home. You can expect to leave earlier, not every time, but some of the days. Would highly recommend him, take any ACC class that you need to with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2009<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a cool guy and knows that the people taking his class aren't all accounting majors. I would get very bored during lectures and got really lost, but I hate accoutning. Midterm, Final and quizzes are the only components to your grade, but DO THE HW! He gives you all the answers to the hw and powerpoints, so it helps a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Doyle knows that the ACC isn't the most interesting class, but he makes it enjoyable.  He also plays off a lot of real-world examples.  Midterm was a lot easier than the final.  Homework is optional but reccomended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2009<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. The material is very complex. This is not an easy subject! Study the material, interact in class, do your part. Tests are easy as long as you stay on track with material and study. Professor has good sense of humor, necessary with the dry material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing Teacher!!! LOVED HIM! The guy is funny and class goes by fast! Gives out easy quizes! Sudy the powerpoints and the midterm and final will be easy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2008<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's pretty funny and gets the entire class involved. Knows material and is very helpful. Two quizzes and homework is not collected. Midterm and Final are on-line.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2008<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a cool professor. If you don't read the book you will most likely fail. Read the book, do homework and you will be fine. Make sure you know your ratio before midterm because the last part of the exam was all based on ratios.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is really awesome.  I learned more about accounting in this class than any other professor I took.  He is a funny guy so I would take him, because what he tells you to study is what is going to be on the exam</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor! He cannot explain the material well at all!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a very good teacher, he talks a lot about himself and is unclear. But if you read the chapters then the midterm and final will be easy. Not a good professor if you dont want to read the book, but if you do you can easily get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was very funny and was a cool teacher.He curves fairly. You have to do the homework to do good in this class. If take him at night, you will get out early everytime, or atleast our class did. Once again hes a good professor and I suggest you take him if you are in accounting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great prof. has lots of experience and relates it to the book which is helpful. witty guy(which is rare in this field) and very fair.  recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2004<br>Class Name: ACC300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME PROFESSOR FOR THIS CLASS.
