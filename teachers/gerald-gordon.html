I took this "intro" class and felt very bad for my fellow classmates and even had a hard time brushing up myself. His assignments are ridiculously difficult for an intro class and took up lots of my time from my important classes so I would avoid if possible!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2013<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>just took his final, unnecessarily hard it was no where along the lines of an intro class..his expectations are way too high for an introductory course, especially considering he cannot teach..i spoke to others in the class and everyone felt the same about the final..i guess he likes feeling smarter than his students</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All I can say is, avoid his class at all costs. I took his class as an elective hoping to learn some Java. Instead he made me hate java by turning the class into a nightmare. He cannot teach, he sits in front of his computer mumbling the entire time! Each assignment felt like a project, midterm and final were ridiculously hard for an intro class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2013<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sitting at a desk on your computer mumbling is not teaching. If teaching at a University was that simple, I could be a professor also. Even if you do well on the assignments he looks at something to pick at, its almost as if he doesn't want his students to do well. He knows his stuff but he cannot teach, he needs to find another day job.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2013<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor ever, during class he covers the SURFACE of topics than assigns homework that requires IN DEPTH knowledge of the material. His assignments are RIDICULOUSLY difficult, and he MUMBLES throughout lecture, incredibly incomprehensible. Someone needs to remind him this is an INTRODUCTORY class, he needs to take it EASY or stop MUMBLING.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2012<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont never ever take this class - i failed even if i did most of the assignments - he is terrible teacher - his assignments are 4 pages long or even longer</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2012<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When I first read the reviews of this professor, I was afraid to take him. Honestly though, I don't know what all the fuss was about. He's not easy, but he explains clearly and often stops to make sure his students are following him.  I learned Java well with him and am satisfied with the way he taught.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2011<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: CSC242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I have ever seen, impossible to understand through his mumbling and stammering, does not explain the material at all, homework is not only incredibly difficult with poorly worded instructions, but also portions which are given bring up errors</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2011<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE!! Do not take this class. This professor does not teach you he only presents to you and expects that you'll know it. He talks too fast and mubbles on top of not actually teaching his students. Complete waiste of time, money and learning. He should not be teaching students!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does not really know how to teach the material, just shows you how to do it and then expects you to know how to do it in a completely different way for hw, hw is almost impossible he expects you to know things that he never taught. unless you already know java, do not take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have never programmed before, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! He goes way, way to fast for any beginner to understand.

Starts off not that bad, but by the time you get to structs and classes, forget trying to make sense of what he's trying to teach, it's easier just to wing it at that point. Avoid like the plague...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2009<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, a bit stodgy and a bit scatter brained at times, but he was a good teacher.  He would probably be better for older students and not so much for regularly aged students (18-22).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gordon is a fine professor.  He tells some background stories that give you experience you can't get at other programing courses.  He tells jokes.  He explains very well and presents the resources; most people just never use them.  They were so helpful I never used the text.  He does not mark absences--JACKPOT!!  Fine to take if you're into it. 350</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2009<br>Class Name: CSC266<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher........I dropped the class, he is hard and for me that I never taken C++ made this class impossible. Do not take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is waaay to hard for an introduction to C++ class. The homework directions are extremely confusing, he babels to himself as he tries to explain the concepts. If you email him for help, he responds with almost exactly what is written in the directions. Scatter-Brained and even makes mistakes in his examples as he presents to the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2008<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He goes VERY fast. I wouldn't recommend taking him unless you have some familiarity with programming and/or can pick up program logic quickly. Utilize his office hours, he's always willing to help and answer any questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2008<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very challenging course for an introduction class. The assignments don't matchup with the class and book materials. He likes to throw curve balls on the exams. Overall however, he's a fair professor who wants his students to sweat. If you looking for a challenge, this is the class to take. If not stay far, far away.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2008<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not recommend taking this class with Gordon. Very confusing lectures, homework far above the level of beginning programmers, and he's not very helpful to students who are having trouble. The book was more insightful and informative than the lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2008<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough class! The homework are difficult for those who have no experience in Java. Exams are hard, but if you do ok on the homework you will do ok on the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2007<br>Class Name: CSC224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough guy! Need lots of effort to get an A. He teaches ok, though. Just have to pay real good attention in class. Exams are difficult. Assignments are challenging. Love the extra credit works.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2007<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take Gordon.  You will end up more confused about programming than you ever were.  Only take him if you know programming already.  It is very difficult to understand him during class.  Lectures are confusing.  Assignments make absolutely no sense.  If you have the opportunity to take another professor, do so because you will learn more.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2007<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worse teacher ever. Not clear and confusing. You will hate programming after him.

But the midterm and final, is too long and not really based on the hw and what we had learned. it is hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2005<br>Class Name: CSC321<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is as outdated as his suits are. Just as everyone said, he is fast and unclear. Most of your work will be challenging and lengthy. He offers little assistance with questions, often leaving you more confused than you were before. If you can avoid him try to otherwise just try to get by.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm sure that Professor Gordon knows C++ very well, but he has trouble teaching it.  Really, the only way to get through this class is to already know C++ or to be willing to learn on your own.  He does know a lot about the history of computers though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2004<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gordon is a really good man. Sometimes he's unclear because he's a genius and knows way too much information. If you don't have any backround experience in C++, don't take this class because he moves very fast. Overall, he's a good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2004<br>Class Name: CSC210<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expected you to know a lot for an introductory course.
