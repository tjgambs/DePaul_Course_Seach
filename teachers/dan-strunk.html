Your team does store checks, 3 CatMan minutes, a final project; + a take-home final. Overall not too much work until the last week or two. All three of the category management classes were pretty chill with lots of guest lectures so I recommend them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2015<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Gives clear instructions on all the assignments as well as walks you through all the steps to ensure you get a good grade. There were two marketing minutes and a case, which are extremely easy, and a take home final. Everything you need to pass his class are on his powerpoint slides. You would have to try very hard to get anything lower than a B </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: MKT578<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor - very passionate about the subject matter. I'd take this class with him if you are in sales. It turned into too much of a Salesman 101 class. But it's an easy class and I did learn salesforce.com, which will add to my resume. Little homework, no assigned reading, as long as you can stomach a heavy sales focus, I'd take it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2009<br>Class Name: MKT578<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Passionate about the material, very consumer goods sales driven subject matter.

Seemed more appropriate for an undergrad class than an MBA course.  Also material seemed about 10 years out of touch.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best marketing professor. Only 4 project is assigned, and they r all in the same format. Don't bother buying the book!not needed if u wanna buy the bk, do wha i did buy it online for 75, sold it back to the bookstore for 80! it was one of those classes that i actually wanted to go to class and listen to his lectures!simply the best</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendance not required, but why would you want to miss his class&#63; There are 4 or so presentations, all the same format. Take home final, same as a presentation. Book is only useful as source for PPT's, but not necessary. He makes so many compromises, always funny, knows his stuff. Couldnt ask for a better prof. I recommend him for ANYONE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2007<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor. This class was so enjoyable that I didn't miss one class. His teaching style is great, and he always makes you laught. Many presentations (I think 5) but they are VERY EASY! Take Home FINAL, also very easy. I think their should be professor like him in every class. I would take this professor again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2006<br>Class Name: MKT378<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very unorganized class.

As long as you stay on top of the reading and pay attention to what he is saying, you should do fairly well with relatively little difficulty. Very straightforward; not in the business of trying to trick students. If I was a Marketing major, I would definitely take him aagin.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2005<br>Class Name: MKT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2005<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly recommend. I took it as a summer class. 2 marketing minute group presentations(only 1 person from group had to present). Midterm and final were take home. They are marketing minutes on paper.
