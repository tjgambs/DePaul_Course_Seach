Specifically there are readings assigned every class, where you need to come up w/ question(s) based on said readings. He's a funny guy. No tests. Downside: You have to give a 10 minute presentation at some point in the class & ton of readings. Do not take this class if you don't like to read!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2015<br>Class Name: REL190<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I was skeptical going into this class due to the reviews here but he actually wasn't bad! Took the class online, it was the usual stuff of reading, responding, and taking quizzes. 1 midterm paper and 1 final paper. Given there was a lot of stuff to read but it still wasn't awful. Get what you put in, I'd take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2015<br>Class Name: CTH246<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>David is a passionate professor and you will learn a great deal from him.  He is crystal clear in the expectations for each assignment, and as long as you follow them, you will be just fine.  Be sure to complete the assigned readings, as the following class discussions will be based on the material.  One of the best professors at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: REL201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Wellman is a very good teacher. He outlines exactly what is expected of you in your papers or presentation. Very fair grader, and most of the students succeed in  his class. 2 papers and 1 small presentation, along with weekly postings to the d2l discussions area.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2013<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wellman is the best teacher i've had so far at DePaul. I plan on taking another class with him again if all plans out well. He is sooooooo smart, engaging, enthusiastic, classy, and charismatic. You will learn so much from professor Wellman and you will have a good time doing so. He is really hip and youthful, and pretty easy on the eyes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2013<br>Class Name: HON350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wellmann is one of the nicest and most helpful professors at DePaul. There is quite a bit of reading to do before each class, but you don't have to read all of it. D2L discussion posts about the readings are due before each class. 3 papers that he walks you through. Really easy to participate in and no book. Interesting and great class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2013<br>Class Name: CTH235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wellman is one of the most brilliant people I have ever met. He knows exactly what he is talking about every topic that is covered in the syllabus. The subjects we cover can get dry at times, but his personality and attitude keep the class entertaining. If you need to take a religion course, go with Dr. Wellman!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Wellman is seriously one of the smartest men I know.  He is also a great teacher, very understanding and truly cares about his students and having them actually LEARN!  Take him! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An incredibly intelligent and insightful person. Very open minded and kind. Helpful and willing. Yes, there is quite a bit of reading, but the reading is interesting and always discussed in class. He is very passionate about his job and about learning new things as well as teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2010<br>Class Name: REL298<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared to have your brain twisted into new and exciting thought.  This class proves to be very challenging but all the expectations are clearly outlined in the syllabus and Dr. Wellman does a fantastic job in teaching the class.  It is the corner stone for the Religious studies program and therefore is intense in vocabulary and expectations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2010<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wellman is awesome. He lets you discover things for yourself and I found that his class had me learning a lot about Christian Ethics in relation to ME rather than just facts. He does grade a little rough, but offers a lot of extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2010<br>Class Name: REL201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very passionate about a very dry and boring subject. I enjoyed his enthusiasm. If you don't want to dress up as a historical figure and give a small presentation in front of class...don't take it. Great man, not so great of a class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: REL201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at DePqaul. Had him for 201 and he offered to do an independent study with me for a class I really needed, which was an exellent learning experience. He truly cares about his students, is patient and challenging and always willing to help. People who took him for 298: that class is supposed to be exceptionally difficult!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2008<br>Class Name: REL298<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wellman's class is unecessarily difficult. There are excessive expensive blackboard printouts and the papers/tests are at the same time and extremely stressful. He is very intelligent and tells interesting side notes. You have to give 100% in this class, it feels much more on the graduate level. If you don't need it, DON'T TAKE IT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this class personally.  Yes, you do have to post two questions to BlackBoard 24 hours prior to each class which is a pain, but not that difficult.  The readings aren't that necessary.  You can read a little bit and still manage to post a good question.  Grade is based off of 3 essays so if you're a good writer you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2008<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst class I've ever taken @ DePaul! This is the first time I've not enjoyed a class at this school. He tries so hard to be transparent that it makes him unclear. He has a very UNREALISTIC view of the world, and believes religion is the medium to solving major world issues. He doesn't allow for debate and fishes for HIS answers from the students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have to agree with the past few comments about the condesending and arrogant nature of Wellman. I dropped the class. I couldn't take it anymore. The computer printouts are worthless and cost a fortune and you have to post responses on Blckbrd for every single class, so you have no breathing room in this class! Larry Raspison is overrated!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2008<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unclear. Helpful only if you call his cell phone. Does not believe any students come close to being as smart as him. Perhaps the worst class I have taken at Depaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2008<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wellman is condescending. he is constantly &quot;fishing&quot; for answers in class and will randomly call on people to define broad terms in the most specific way. Also he asks all students to read at least a 1000 pages of textbook material on blackboard. I would not recommend him unless you want to leave every class extremely frustrated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2008<br>Class Name: REL201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was very engaging and seemed to care about his students. His attendance policy is strict- you can only miss two classes. There are only 2  papers and they are only 4 pages. You only have to read enough to be able to ask two questions about it. Easy class that you can learn a lot from.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2008<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is very smart and engaging. Although he may seem intimidating at first, he's the most friendliest and helpful teacher at DePaul. He does assign at lot of readings, but you really don't have to read them. u have to write 3 essays and post 2 questions on Blackboard. There are no tests in his class!u will def learn a lot in his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: REL102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wellman is a great teacher. Yes, he can be hard at times but it's throughout the papers. At times he can be vague, but it's only because he wants you to figure it out for yourself. There's readings every class that you don't really have to do. Just skim the pages and have something interesting to say. Papers are okay, I got As on em</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2008<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wellman is one of the best professors at DePaul. I would absolutely recommend taking this course. His enthusiasm is unrivaled and he makes class and the topic engaging. The course work can be difficult, but it is very straight forward, do what he asks and you will do well in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2008<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want a class that is challenging, interesting to attend, yet not that difficult to succeed in, take this class. I don't understand the ratings that say he was unclear in what he wanted out of his students, because in fact he is very clear. If you follow all his guidelines, and can write fairly well, you will get an A in this class. Prof. is</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2007<br>Class Name: REL262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't really care for the subject matter, but considering you need to take a religion class here at DePaul, you should try him out. Nice guy, passionate, and willing to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2007<br>Class Name: HST262<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class really wasn't bad at all. There are 3 papers which are 25% of your grade, you have to post 2 questions on blackboard 24 hrs. before every class as part of your participation grade. Just do exactly what he asks for on the papers and you'll do fine. The professor is nice and very enthusiastic about the subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2007<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was a little hard for me because i can't write papers, sometimes the class was a little boring, but he was trying to make it fun, when he will tell you how to do the paper - do it exactly the way he said, he also a hard grader. come to class and participate because you earn points</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2006<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>professor wellman is such a great professor! he is sooo enthusiatic, its actually kind of funny. he encourages you to become involved, he wants to hear what you have to say and is patient when you are confused and dont make any sense at all. he is so kind that he will work with you outside of class. he spells out what he expects very clearly and is</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He requires alot but is a good prof. His class isn't easy, but you're in collage- no one said it was going to be easy. It was an iteresting class.

He knows exactly what he's talking about. If you catch on quickly then you'll be fine. You have 3 Case Studies and a moral guidepost paper at the end. This is not hard at all- he spells out exactly what you have to do. I did pretty good in this class and if you post questions on blackboard and do what is required you</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2006<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely hard and confusing. If your not confucious dont take it. Purposely doesnt tell you what he really expects from you in essays.

As long as you act like your interested during his lectures and pay attention you will do fine. He assigns alot of reading but you only have to read enough to come up with 2 questions...so basically you can do it in 10 min.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: RELMG228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared to read ALOT!

Almost impossible to get A in this class. Only 2 out of 80 ppl got A- and rest average out  a C-. Not very clear to what he expects from you.
