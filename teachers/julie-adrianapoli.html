One of my rubrics was better than another students, yet he received an A and I was stuck with a B+.  She seems extremely pretentious and catty.  Her participation grading is ridiculous...I talk every class...the more i participated the more i got docked. You can tell shes new and cant teach.</div></div></div></body></html>
