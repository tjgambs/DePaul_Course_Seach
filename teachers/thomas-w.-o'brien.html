The discussions we have in class are super interesting. However, it's a pretty work intensive class- there's a lot of reading before every class as well as a discussion post. There are 3 papers that he isn't very specific about. But it's a very stimulating class, and I'm glad I took it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2015<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is always discussion with reading and d2L posts due ahead. 3 papers, 46and 8 pages. Easy paper grader because he shares clear guidelines.  Assigns chapter from great book each class and assigns repetitive articles about science each time. I got an A- in participation and I participated a fair amount. Honors seminar style class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2014<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy online class. I did not try and got a B+ so if I had put in effort it would of been better.  Book was not needed, because his lectures cover the entire chapters. Three papers. Two papers were short and the last one was your final paper which was one page longer. Recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2013<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard grader. i ended up with a B in the class. Write papers every week and do a discussion. Most papers are up to 2 pages long and the longer ones go up to 4-5. Dont really need the book</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2012<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took his online class. He requires weekly 2-3 page papers and weekly discussions postssuper easy. Email turnaround time is also pretty quick. He grades using a rubric, so sometimes you dont understand why he gives you certain grades. If he were to explain better, it would be a great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2012<br>Class Name: MGMT228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Graded randomly. Just when I thought I knew what he wanted from a paper, he would give me a poor grade on the next assignment. It felt like he was filling a status quo. I emailed him several times on a case study. He never answered. Don't take him if you can avoid him. I'm a senior and he is definately NOT DePaul status.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2011<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far one of the best teachers I have had so far at DePaul. The structure of the course was very clear. Homework was reasonable, just two weekly blog bosts, 2 papers and a final paper. There is a good amount of reading too. Thomas is enthusiastic and knowledgeable about religion, so class is never dull. Definitely recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2011<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I will definitely never take this course again.

There is a total of 10 papers, 4 pg the most. You have to participate on Bb every week for a grade. Read the book and analyze a few interesting ethical cases. The class has a great structure. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: REL183<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof O'Brien is BORING!

I genuinely loved this class. He didn't have a midterm/final test.. or any test for that matter. I still remember all the knowledge from this class because it wasn't forced. Very interesting, extremely insightful, and SUCH a nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: REL283<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the person below me. I mean, he is a nice guy and all but his attendance policy is ridiculous. The class is super boring and you find yourself staring at the clock waiting for class to be over. He did grade really hard on my papers for pretty stupid things. Overall nice guy but his class needs to be much different.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2009<br>Class Name: REL283<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a dope, boring class, actually a hard grader, he graded the grammar on the papers and would be wrong about it and mark you down heavily for it, got very little out of it, nice guy, but would never take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2009<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tom is a GREAT professor! It is obvious that he genuinely cares about his students and his course. Since he doesn't force you to memorize anything or take tests, I got much more than I ever thought out of this class. I learned SO much from Tom. It was a wonderful experience, and Tom is SOO knowledgeable! TAKE HIM! One of the best profs at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was sooo easy. If you are looking for an easy religion class than this should be it! He is so nice and understanding and also has some interesting things to say. We had seven one page papers that were spaced out over the quarter. There is NO midterm and NO final... the final is the last one page paper. SOOOO easy! take it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2007<br>Class Name: REL183<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice guy although the first few weeks are booooorrriing. talk during class discussions and cite a lot in ur papers and ur guaranteed an A. weekly quizzes are easy but lengthy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: REL183<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, class was kind of boring, Only homework is weekly quizes you do online, Their so-so. For a good grade just focus on one theme during class to memorize and then write your paper on it, he grades papers very easily. Only thing that i thought was hard was the subject. Some of the stuff we had to wrap our heads around was confusing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2007<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>sweet teacher. Very easy A.  all you have to do is give opinion in cases in class and I never have read the book yet.  Assignments are papers and he is easy on them. even lets you redo them.  My suggestion is to take good nots and remember one theory so you can write you papers. Thats all it takes. I would recommed him to anyone needing a JPA bust</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2007<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy...easy class...easy A. The &quot;case studies&quot; that everyone complains about takes about five minutes to do, and he isn't a hard grader by any standard. Take it from an anonymous guy on the internet who got an A in his class: he's good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2006<br>Class Name: DISCOVERCHI<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice guy, very nice and helpful. boring as hell though. he made us read his book but never tested us for it. he's an easy a just boring.  i recommend him if you want to learn something and get an a!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2006<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice guy but the class is boring!!!

All we do is write a 2 page thesis paper every two weeks, and on the days you don't &quot;present&quot; you discuss others' papers...papers can be stressful, but overall this is my favorite class and dr. o'brien is a really stand up guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: REL283<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor's lectures are extremely boring.  He reads Pope's documents outloud to the class the whole time.  Each class you miss he drops your grade by a certain percentage.  Not a very hard class as long as you can stand to sit through the lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: REL283<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him, good teacher and really caring, you learn something and have the ability to get a good grade.

He makes the class enjoyable and it seems like you aren't doing any work at all. But he does assign many lengthy readings which you don't necessarily have to read. He is fun and you can easily pull it off by showing up to class. He is never boring and knows plenty about the subject. I would definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2005<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The easiest class ever.  Prof. is totally cool.  Four papers and that's it.  Didn't even try and pulled an A.  I don't know what the other person saying he nails you on the paps.  He is too easy of a grader, I think.  But then again if you don't know how to write a simple 2 page paper...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A good, lighthearted teacher.  Fairly interesting class. Great class to take to get rid of that religion requirement, seeing as we did not talk about religion once. NO tests! Only papers.
