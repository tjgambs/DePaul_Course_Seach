Do not take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>If you complete all of the work and read the textbook you should be completely fine. He gives feedback on papers and discussions basically telling you what you need to fix to get an A. You definitely need a college level of writing to pass this class. You write a lot. Quizzes are 5 questions with 3 times to take them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most ridiculous class possible. VERY harsh grader. Has impossible-to-please expectations for his papers, where you basically need to have a Pulitzer to pass them. Instructions are unclear and basically wants you to rewrite the textbook. Tests are extremely difficult and contain the vaguest possible answers. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Easy easy class that fills the lsp, topic is on three cultures of America. I mean, easy class if only you're on college level writing and reading skills, some people are not. Do all assignments then you're A. Weekly MC quiz, 5 question only. Textbook is like a 300 page novel only and you just have to skim. Read slides and discussion topics site.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: AMS200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely tough grader. Took this course to fulfill a liberal arts requirement and it required more of my time + effort than any of the courses for my major. Only take this class if you are an exceptional writer - most assignments are graded based on paragraph structure and grammar rather than your understanding of the material</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2014<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Took online US history class. So much reading, videos and lectures to watch for a 7 questions quiz in which the answer is extremely ambiguous. Quizzes are unforgiving and worth a lot. Writing assignments were really easy. Theres a discussion post each week on primary sources in which you are supposed to read and write a lot about which sucks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear syllabus and guidelines provided online. Due dates are often on Friday nights which are very inconvenient. Overall, for a sophomore seminar class he was a very, very difficult grader and the world load was excessive. Obviously, to do well, you have to work hard but his expectations were too much for a non-major class. Avoid if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2014<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is not that difficult however his weekly quizzes are extremely confusing and difficult to distinguish between what he expects you to answer on the quizzes and what you have read in the book. Very unclear and harsh grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2014<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expects way too much and the course load is massive. Terribly harsh grader.  Not helpful at all.  Stay away if you do not want to have a teacher make your quarter terrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Discover with Prof Burton, seemed great right away and made all of us Freshmen feel comfortable. But by the end of the quarter I found myself hating him. He forces his personal lifestyle on the class, has VERY high expectations for your papers and is possibly one of the most boring lecturers I have ever heard. Only take if needed for major!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Burton's LSP200 online course was one of the most intensive I've had. In a 2 and a half weeks, we had to do 6 papers, 10 quizzes and several discussion boards. He's a critical grader and expects way too much. Don't take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2012<br>Class Name: LSP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Burton is one of the worse teachers I have ever had. I don't think he could be teaching high school either. Not only is he a very picky grader, but he also talks very slow and is redundant. He is not helpful at all and I would never take a class with him again. I came into this class with such interest in the subject but not anymore.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: AMS200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Harsh grader! Worked my butt off and recieved Ds and Cs. avoid if you?re not majoring in american studies.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2011<br>Class Name: LGQ150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Discussions were fun, but they would get repetitive at times. Fair grader. He creates a comfortable classroom setting. The only negative I would say is he expects a 10-12 page paper at the end of the quarter that's based on readings you've done throughout the course unfortunately most of the readings say the same thing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: LGQ150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I will never take this teacher ever again! To me, this was THE most mentally stubbing class I've ever had; I thought he was incredibly boring, incapable of getting a class discussion going, and he grades too harshly when he doesn't have a clear grading scale. Good things: reading pdf articles and a total of 8 papers including midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2010<br>Class Name: LGQ150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would completely recommend this class and this professor. I felt like he handled the issues very tactfully and as a straight student in the class, I felt very comfortable participating in conversation.  Professor Burton is very clear about his expectations and the class really helped open my eyes to LBGQT issues.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2008<br>Class Name: AMS200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, who means well and wants the students to do well. He allowed me to do some extra credit assignments which was very nice of him. classes can be   brutely long and boring some days and interesting others. Doesn't give too much H.W. but I still found him to be a very harsh grader. Overall I would say J.Burton just like any Prof. has his + an</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2008<br>Class Name: AMS200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>honestly horrible teacher. all he does is lecture non-stop for the whole hour, he uses boring powerpoints w one word on them and then talks for 15 mins about it. really the worst class I have ever taken and I regret it so much! plus he ALWAYS wears black which is super weird!!! DO yourself a favor and DONT take this class with him..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst College Professor I have ever had. He would make us sit in circles with our desks and stare at each other the entire morning and answer questions that no one would have an answer for. This was for the salem witch trials focal point class. He graded papers way too harshly, I got all A's in my english classes, but barely passed his papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2007<br>Class Name: AMS200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great speaker, obviously passionate about American history. Hands out essay questions in advance for midterm and finals. Lectures are important and pop quizzes happen about once a week, so attendance is a must.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Contrary to what some others have said, I found Mr. Burton to be very helpful. I missed class due to illness one day and he sought me out and made time for me to make up a video worksheet that counted for a large part of my grade.  I think hes a great teacher and very interesting.  Definitely take a class with him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2006<br>Class Name: AMS200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>took class based on other peoples ratings. Bad idea. Boring class, teacher made no attempt to make it interesting, no variance from day to day, No Blackboard, takes forever to email back. Not a good class or teacher. Avoid, unless you need a nap.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2006<br>Class Name: AMS200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked this class. He actually makes history interesting. You use the book alot, and the tests aren't easy, but if you study this class can actually teach you something. He's a great speaker and very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2006<br>Class Name: HST398<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome.

He and J. Baxter (the other professor teaching on the trip) do not do any work on the field, but instead sit and watched.  Also, no free time on the trip! Lastly, he wears his pants entirely too tight!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: COLONIALAMER<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible class. he relies on the class to have a discussion with little input from him. reading journals are busy work and a waste of time. however, you are not held accountable for the material (no midterm or final)...just a 10 page paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: AMS201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely great professor... class is not lecture but class discussion... tons of reading but I learned more than I thought I could have...
