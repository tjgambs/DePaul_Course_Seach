He talks from long years of experience and shows lots of cool new technologies in class. He is very helpful to his students and very understanding. My friends were not joking when they told me about him. Take his course I can guarantee you will not regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2013<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very well organized course. The professor seemed passionate about new technology and how it affect our daily lives. I high recommend this course and especially this instructor if you want to learn about technology.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2013<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the topic.  Thought provoking discussions are a nice change from the usual straight lectures most classes offer. Lots of work (5 short papers, weekly online quizes, online and in class discussions, and a presentation), but if you complete all the assignments, you will get an A.  Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2013<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear professor and knowledgeable course</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2013<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Generous grader, lets you out of class early, barely discusses the text. Very, very easy class. Buy the ebook so you can search easily for answers on the quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2012<br>Class Name: MIS362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class. Always got out early. Reads from and tests directly from the powerpoints, he skips over irrelevant slides, and applies teachings to his own work experience. His simplistic style enabled me to learn a lot from this class. He was very helpful with the final project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2011<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is great and responsive. Class is interesting, although could simply be an online course since it is taken up by presentations. Buy the e-book.  If you do your work, easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2010<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enthusiastic and energetic professor.  High volume of text book reading with weekly online quizzes.  1/2 of class taken up with student presentations - good exercise for the students but not very helpful for the class.  Case studies purchased but hardly referred to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2010<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Professor said that he was the VP for Verizon. Most, if not all, of his real-life experiences involve him doing webcam chat with a red sweater and personal use of the MiFi. I learned nothing from class. The text book is extremely useful. If you do not read the text (~70 pages/ week) + case studies, you will have wasted your tuition money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First 1/2 of class is dedicated to student presentations.  They did not add that much value and went too long (30 min vs 10 min).  Prof just let people ramble at times.  Rest of class is recap of presentations and then very little discussion on book and cases.  Book and cases are only necessary for online quizzes.  Prof was enthusiastic and nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. has tons of work experience and enthusiasm.  But most of the class is taken up by student presentations and prof's recap of their work. Some topics are really good.  Classwork: a 15 min. presentation, biweekly tech article summaries, online quizzes, and disc. board comments.  Super low stress class, but high vol reading (the whole book).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Impossible to keep up with the volume of reading, but half way through you realize you don't have to if you'd bought the digital versions of the book/case studies.  Recap of student presentations is a waste of time.  He talks a lot but he gives half the class time to student presentations. I wish he'd do a slide or two of key points for each class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2010<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm a Finance concentration that new very little about the IT world.  I learned a good amount in this class.  Knoerzer is an enthusiastic professor who wants you to learn.  There is about a couple hours of homework needed for each class, but it is his grading is very generous.  If I was forced to take another IT course, I would take Knoerzer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2010<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I work in the IT world and I did not learn one thing. The class time was poorly structured into boring student presentations on random IT topics and then the a recap of those presentations. The book/case material was hardly covered. Maybe the business students found this class interesting but I found it a waste of time. Easy A if that's your thing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2010<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He teaches/talks with a lot of energy and enthusism. There is a lot of reading (the entire textbook) plus case studies. He tests readings via open book online quizzes. Quizes are pretty easy. Get the digital version of the xanadu case readings so you can search on the questions for the quiz.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2009<br>Class Name: MIS681<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was awesome! Not hard at all, a lot of reading and papers, but as long as you do it, you will be fine!  Real World stories that actually tie the class and homework together.

He motivated class to participate. His experience related to knownledge is so high. Focus on lectures, and business cases. You must read the textbook to take quizz online. Attend class every time.

The syllabus could have had a bit more clarity (to be fair, he didn't write it), but he always answered any questions.  Brings in a lot of real-world experiences, which help a lot.
