She is really clear and will answer any and all questions that you ask. Too bad I do not have any more requirements with her. She is by far the best programming teacher at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2012<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really easy course.  During the quarter, you only have to pass/fail some easy hw/quizzes, and your grade is dependent on the midterm/final.  Sounds scary, but almost everyone got an A on the midterm at least.  She's really helpful and a little scatterbrained, never a bad thing in a prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2012<br>Class Name: CSC262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Heart is a great teacher who is very down to earth and crystal clear.

Encouraged students' engagement in class, made it a very safe environment for them to inquire or discuss the course material. Very informed about the programming field, assignments were clear, she quickly responded to any questions I had with a clear answer. I wish I could take more classes with her.</div></div></div></body></html>
