If you're not a history major,  don't take her.  My four years at the DePaul she was the first teacher to gave me a D on a paper. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Loved taking this class with her. She makes history interesting. I have always hated history and I got an A. Lectures are very long but she makes them interesting. Tests are easy and straight forward. There are three over the quarter and she drops your lowest score. There are two papers that she grades hard, but they're manageable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2014<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I was a bit skeptical she seemed as though she was going to be strict and a drag. Like mono toned history professor drag. Turns out she was actually quite engaging and really challenged the class to look at history with a critical prospective rather than memorize the facts. She LOVES what she does. Oh and be prepared to read a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2013<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>If you ever wanted to hear a Southern belle (she grew up in northeast TN) lecture about the Civil War, this is the teacher for you. A drawback, though, is she assigns is one essay per month, and she grades them brutally; she worked as a copy editor before she was a professor. Straightforward outline-style lectures, and a great sense of humor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2013<br>Class Name: HIS181<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was so boring. Never 8:30 lecture with her. She reads directly off powerpoints, yet refuses to post them online. Nice woman, not so great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2013<br>Class Name: HIST182<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Terry was a great teacher! Tests are really easy, and final was crazy easy. But she's a super tough essay grader like its ridiculous. Even after she peer reviews your essay you still get a bad grade after doing what she says. Whole class is 100 its so don't slack off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Terry is fabulous. Her class is very organized and structured and she's super clear and helpful when teaching. She has a strict no-electronics policy in her classroom, which people tend to complain about, but it's really not so hard to put your phone away for 90 mins.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2012<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. Her lectures take basic theses about the topic and go into some specific examples. Take note of these, they WILL show up on the test. You barely need the textbook (I think I read it once all quarter) but definitely get the other books for the class. Tests are cake but she's a very hard grader on papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2012<br>Class Name: HIST181<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall good teacher. Speaks clearly and follows the rubric accordingly. However her classes are a little hard, much material to cover and lots of reading to do.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2012<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love, love, LOVE Prof. Terry. She really cares about her students and what she is teaching. As other comments mention, she doesn't allow electronics of any sort and attendance is mandatory (but not part of your grade). Yes, she grades papers hard, but I don't even like history and I loved her and loved the class. I learned so much. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2012<br>Class Name: HIST371<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher who was thrown a class that she has a true passion for. Her grading scale is difficult, but entirely manageable with proper planning. Anyone who loves a challenge and to actually learn things please take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does not anyone use electronics or go to the bathroom. Don't even bother coming in late, or she will stop class and stare at you. Attendance is mandatory, and workload is manageable. Tests are extremely easy, but papers are almost near impossible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So yeah Terry doesn't let you use electronics, learn to use a pencil! The class is very structured and if you keep up with reading this class is not difficult at all! If you like Am History you will love this class if you don't, then yes not being able to use your cell phone will drive you crazy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: HIST181<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid this class! Professor Terry is very rude and controlling. Not allowing grown adult students to go to the bathroom during class, or use any electronics. Treats class as if in grade school. Lectures are straight from text book, and test are very easy. She grades papers extremely hard and no matter what seems to not give out A's. AVOID </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2011<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Taking time out of my busy schedule to warn you all--Professor Terry is an unfair grader. Tests are easy as pie. When it comes to papers, though, it's laughable! I was in a freshman history class with her. She grades papers as though she's teaching a graduate level English class. Don't expect to get an A on papers. I'll never take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: HIST181<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NICE PROFESSOR BUT GRADES PAPERS VERY HARD...THE CLASS IS INTERESTING BUT SHE GRADES EXTREMELY HARD!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2011<br>Class Name: HIST181<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Terry is one of the worst professors ever. Attendance is not mandatory but don't ever come into class late or she will hate you. All of the information is from book and powerpoints. She is a tough paper grader,I had her proofread my paper before turning it in and she said it was good. Then she gave me a C+. she is arrogant avoid taking he</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was my replacement teacher after my first one went into the hospital. She was great! It may only seem that way because my first teacher was horrible, but whatever. She was clear and helpful and guided our discussions but still made us figure things out for ourselves. She basically saved us all from a wasted quarter. Great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>well... I've never taken time to write in this before and can't believe i actually am. But seriously, this professor is possibly the hardest grader at DePaul.. such a big work load. if you have other things going on in life then do not take this class.. it is not manageable</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2010<br>Class Name: HIS181<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont get me wrong shes a very nice teacher but her paper grading is nothing that i have ever seen before by any Depaul professor. Almost everyone in the class had low paper averages and it counts as 40% of your grade. Be prepared if you plan to take her that you must be an excellent writer</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: HST279<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic teacher. Enormous amounts of reading, but it pays off with knowledge. She is the most interesting person, I don't understand why anybody wouldn't love her as a person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Terry's class to simply fill up a learning domain req.  I am now using up one of my gen electives just so I can take her again. She was extremely clear and helpful. Always wants her students to succeed. Class was engaging and workload was manageable. You will not regret taking a class with her! She is so nice and a great person to talk to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2009<br>Class Name: HIST181<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exceptional teacher, very interested in subject material and enjoys connecting with intellectual students. Can teach every min, outside of the 15 min break, in a 3 hour class. Difficult to get an A but easy to get B+/A-. This is due style of question she uses on multiple choice, often two correct answers requires you to choose the best one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2009<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Terry is absolutely wonderful! She is very funny and relates well to students. Attendance is not mandatory but she sometimes throws in extra credit for the people who do show up. Very straightforward and her tests are fair and easy if you pay attention in class. You want to take her class, I promise!</div></div></div></body></html>
