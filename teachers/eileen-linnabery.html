She gives few homework assignments and covers all the material from the book thoroughly in class. Her midterm and final are all multiple choice and they are very easy. Take her class, its worth it even if it's an 8am!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2014<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers I've had at DePaul. Very nice, patient, and helpful, and has very clear and interesting lectures. With her, the material is very easy to understand. Not at hard grader either. I very highly recommend you take her class, I would do anything to have her teach my next Psychology class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2013<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Very laid back teacher and she knows her material very well. Took a PSY class in high school and this one was a piece of cake. I would recommend to read the chapters before class, as she wants you to. Makes the lectures that much easier to understand. I have over a 100% in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2013<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far one of the best professors. She is so patient and extremely helpful. There are daily quizzes, but they help you to prepare prepare to study for the midterm and final exam. She makes the class fun and getting an A is easy if you put enough effort into the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most helpful teacher ever! In my opinion I think Psychology is the most interesting subject and she makes it so much fun. She loves to talk about drinking and partying. Only 6 HW assignments the whole quarter. There are 1 question quizzes every day on the material from the pervious class but they are "give me" questions that are not hard</div></div></div></body></html>
