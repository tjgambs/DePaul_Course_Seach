If I wanted to read the newspaper everyday, I would. I don't need to pay DePaul's bogus tuition rates for someone to read me the media's crap. She would look for ways to take up ten weeks & made tests hard. Class is BS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2004<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the worst class.  teacher can be very moody.  sometimes treates students like 3rd graders.  if you like pain take her tests.  she loves making things difficult and doesn't grade real easy.  too many readings too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2004<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2004<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really great teacher. Her class was hard (especially the tests) but it was worth it. She was interesting and always willing to help. Only bad part is she assigns long readings.
