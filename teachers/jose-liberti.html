Jose does not treat you like a student, he treats you like a colleague. He is blunt. Unfortunately he is leaving DePaul. He hast taught at LBS, Chicago and Kellogg. I heard he is moving back to Kellog. I never understood what he was doing at DP. Great loss for the school, but I understand why he wants to leave.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2012<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jose is the real deal.  He is extremely passionate about the material and he translates that passion to his students who want to learn. You won't want to miss a class as you will learn so much about each case...it turns into a lot of fun.  A solid group is crucial to the level of enjoyment you will get from the semester. Be ready to work HARD!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: FIN551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took 551 in the Winter Quarter. Enrolled in Jose's FIN 558 in the Spring. I know as he says: I love pain! Incredible class, by far the best teacher at DP. What is he doing at DP? Sure he'll be leaving soon. Get ready to work for 11 weeks as you never did in any other course and to be challenged.  Be prepared to be corrected in class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2012<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worked like a dog this quarter!Over 25hours/week for case study. BUT for me the most Awarding course and most Responsible prof. in DePaul. If you really want into the finance industry, take it. Last thing, Jose may leave after summer, so hold the last chance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jose is best of the best professors I have ever meet in my whole study life!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2012<br>Class Name: FIN558<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantaaaaastic class! Jose is clearly a prof that doesnt teach thinking on course evaluations. He will tell you the things straightforward. If u dont like to be corrected or challenged then dont take the class. Be ready to work for 11 weeks like any other class at DP. You'll realize you wasted a lot of money in other courses. Be ready to work!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2012<br>Class Name: FIN551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take Jose's class. I have learned more in 5 classes thus far than in the entire MBA finance program. It is a shame that some students complaint about the amount of work.

What a fantastic class. I do not understand why Jose is at the depaul. he is clearly a top-business school teacher. this is the best class i have had in the whole program. he is so passionate. he really cares about students understanding. other professors at dp should imitate jose's attitude. thanks!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2012<br>Class Name: FIN551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing prof. So much passion. Had first class last week. Excellent professor. Very challenging, interesting and no etiquette! Do not take this class for the sake of a grade. I heard many times he is leaving depaul. school should be grateful if they can retain him. i guess this is how a top business school prof looks like.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2012<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We had yesterday our first class.

Silly to even compare this course with other DP courses. There is just no comparison! This course is from a top MBA school. All other finance prof. should learn how Jose teaches.  Practical, upfront, interesting, challenging, and absolutely blunt. Fantastic insanely demanding course by a fantastic teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2010<br>Class Name: FIN558<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best prof I've had, ever! Be prepared to work harder, think more critically and be challenged more than you ever have. He is very up front and tells you how hard you will have to work. Believe him! But he puts in as much, if not more, effort than the students. Don't take for an easy &quot;A&quot;. But not a hard grader if you work really hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2010<br>Class Name: FIN558<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best prof I've had, ever!

Jose is an amazing teacher, he is very dedicated, cares and teaches as a top-MBA institution. He is by far the best teacher I've had. You will work like a dog, but every penny of your tuition is worth it. If you want to really learn take his class. DePaul should hire more profs. like Jose. He is the best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2010<br>Class Name: FIN558<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had first class yesterday.

If you want to learn real finance & valuation, he is a MUST take. Unfortunately, he's one of the only Professors at Kellstadt that drives home financial valuation so you know it in your sleep. If you want to compete against MBA grads from Booth, Harvard, & other Top Tier, he is must.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: FIN551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree to everyone, best professor at DePaul, if you intrest in Finance  you must  take Jose as professor. Its lot of work,group meeting and its a case base class different from traditonal midterm -final system.Be perpared to work hard and commit to this class.Jose is like a coach, you get trained to work hard  and work smart.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: FIN558<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the best Professor at DP. Other fin profs should learn how to teach from Jose. No barrier as Dr, no Professor title, just Jose, but it is all about respect, and hard work.If you want to learn take his class. Just talked to him & he is leaving DePaul. Very sad. DP should be ashamed of losing him. DP cannot accept that profs need to change!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2010<br>Class Name: FIN551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of THE BEST professors in Finance at DePaul.

The professor truly cares about how you do, and cares more about you understanding the material - quantitatively and qualitatively.  He doesn't emphasize grades, he just wants you to learn.  His course alone has made me want pursue M&A valuations as a career.  His passion in knowledge amazing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: FIN558<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are a finance MBA at a DePaul, you do yourself a disservice if you don't take one of his classes.  He is by far the best professor the program has to offer.  He doesn't lie about the work requirements of his class, you will need to dedicate ALL of your free time to his class but it is worth it.  The knowledge is invaluable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2010<br>Class Name: FIN558<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've heard Jose is leaving DePaul. This is sad for the school. How can it be that they cannot retain this high quality profs.&#63; It is clear he has tried to change many things at the school, but he is frustrated. The best prof. I've had at DePaul. If you want to learn something and not waste your money, take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2010<br>Class Name: FIN588<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The weekly projects are very challenge, but also very valuable.

I think the stigmas are from people that have not had Jose or are not dedicated; anyone that is dedicated says Jose is the best professor and it is true. Yeah, it's hard but rewarding. Get in a good group and go to Plymouth after every class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2010<br>Class Name: FIN551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the best prof I had (and have) at the school. Jose is too different than the rest of the profs. It is clear that teaching is his life. DePaul should hire more profs as Jose.  Very friendly, but dont get fooled about this. The 11 weeks are the the most intense, enjoyable and REWARDING you will have at DP. He really cares about the student.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: FIN558<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the man. If you enjoy business, I hope you do if your an MBA student, take him! But know, the comments are correct, it is VERY challenging and you won't have much of a life, but its worth it.

At the beginning of the class he tells you that it is a very involved class and if you plan on traveling on the weekend not to take it.  HE MEANS IT.

Jose was willing to spend additional time with students, but without enough feedback, it is difficult to assess progress in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2009<br>Class Name: FIN558<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jose is phenomenal and it is a shame to hear about the way some students have reacted to him. If you are in grad school you should be prepared to learn and work hard, both of which Jose's classes fulfill. If you are doing 553 or 558 prepare not to see the sun for 12 weeks but also be prepared for a challenging&rewarding class with a great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2009<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Professor ever. 100% commit to the class.Big fan of case study, best way to learn!
