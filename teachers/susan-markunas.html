Modules run week to week and everything is under that tab for what you need to know. Discussion posts are kind of repetitive but she uses current examples to move the class along. If you want an easy online class, take this!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2015<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>A fairly easy class. Not an easy grader but okay. Textbook isn't that important. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2015<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Markunas was super helpful, and clear about what she expected in class. Average amount of homework. Made a super boring topic relatively interesting. Lectures are super thorough so I barely used the book. No tests, just weekly quizzes and assignments. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2015<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Markunas was a very helpful professor. As long as you do all of the assignments or most of them, you should be fine! She's really not too difficult of a grader as long as you give her everything that she is asking for in the assignment. There are also a good amount of extra credit opportunities that really boost grades! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2015<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Markunas is a great professor! She goes through and thoroughly explains the material. You can tell that she genuinely cares that her students do well. All the tests are open note and open book which is a plus, but you don't really need to buy the book. I highly recommend taking her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2014<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A if you remember to do the homework.

She is great at explaining all of the research concepts and provides plenty of examples to help students understand what is expected of them. She responds back to email very promptly and is very accommodating to students' needs!

Just five online quizzes, two papers, plus random/fun activities she assigns. The class is interesting in general, but even if it wasn't she's very engaging with the students/chatting. Plus she's super friendly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2013<br>Class Name: 340PSY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the best teacher ever!!!!! I have taken three of her classes and she is amazing. She cares a lot about her students and will work with you to accommodate you without letting you short yourself on any learning opportunities. She makes you work for your grades but you will get out of her classes what you put in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2012<br>Class Name: PSYCH240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Professor Markunas! She is a great teacher and made me actually excited about math! I took Psych 240 with her and I loved her so much I took 241 with her too! I highly highly recommend her. She wants everyone to succeed and works hard to make sure everyone understands the material. Take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2012<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Markunas is amazing!!! I took PSY240 with her and am currently taking PSY241. Before taking PSY240 I hated anything math related, but after her course I'm a true believer that all it takes is an amazing professor who cares about what she does to turn those negative thoughts around.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2012<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Markunas is amazing. I had her for stats and took her again cuz she takes dull info and makes it very interesting. She gives many examples and does lots of activities to help you understand the material. She breaks down the paper in separate sections throughout the quarter so it's easier to write and gives lots of feedback. TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor is rude, seems to not really care if students pass or not. She goes over information but it's not clear and the examples that we do in class are more like 1+1 while the examples on hw are more like 35% of 64 *394/84.Not a very helpful professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2012<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher ever.  Very organized and easy going.  I had her for stats and now for RM I and I love, love her! You will love psychology just because of her.  She makes you learn and love to learn anything without any stress.  I would simply say she is a sweetheart. Hot too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Markunas is amazing! I hate math, but after her lectures I would leave feeling accomplished. I refuse to take a math course with anyone else but her. In fact I just registered for PSY 241 and hope she teaches PSY 242 as well. I believe every teacher can learn from her, she's the best!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2012<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Marcunas is the best.

Her classes are the only ones that I feel like I get a lot out of without stressing out all quarter. Things that would normally bore me, are actually interesting to me now. I'm not sure exactly what makes her teaching style work so well for me, but I would definitely recommend taking at least 1 class with her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher.

Super easy too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved her! She is very helpful and nice. We used the book a lot, lectures and notes. A midterm, final (both multiple choice and short answeres). We have 4 hw assignments 2 quizzes that are worth..noting basically and a few activities. EASY</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2010<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very interested in what she's saying and knows a lot about it. The class is almost all lecture (mostly from the book, so kind of repetitive if you do the reading) but she shows videos which break it up and make it really interesting. Lots of extra credit opportunities. I'd definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Markunas was very helpful and clear in class. Attending class is mandatory or you will fall behind. There is a lot of group work involved. As long as you keep up with homework and study for the exams (which are very fair) this class will be a breeze. Loved this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a great teacher.

She very helpful and the homework isn't hard at all!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2009<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Markunas was very helpful and clear, however, her quizes and tests were really hard unless you study extremely hard to cover every bit of the information.  Everything she teaches in this class will for the most part lead to the next thing she'll teach so keeping up with the information and showing up to hear what she has to say is mandato</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2009<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Markunas was a great teacher. She is willing to help everyone and makes her expectations very clear. She also gives extra credit which helps, because her quizzes are kind of hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT professor! If you take her for Research Methods she is great and thorough.  Had her for a hybrid course, half online.  If you get lost she is very willing to assist.  More professors should be like her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is very easy as long as you pay attention to her lectures.  She is very helpful in and out of class.  If you do your homework and study for the midterm and final (which are both easy) it is pretty much a guaranteed A.  She is also good looking which makes class more fun.  The class was useful and I learned a lot about Excel.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Information isn't very useful to know.  She breezes through explanations quickly and isn't very helpful. She is very picky about grading and will mark down  an assignment for the tiny details.  Would not recommend her class to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>super sweet and helpful. goes through everything in great detail and clarity and goes at a steady pace so everyone is on the same level. hw assignments due every week, as well as in class assignments. cares about her students and making sure everyone is on the same page. handouts of the notes every week, which are also online..def recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is really easy if you attend class and do all of the assignments. Only about 5 homework assignments you do by yourself and then there are a bunch of group in-class assignments. Final project isn't too bad but you have to meet with your group outside of class. Professor Markunas is really helpful and responds to emails quickly</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely easy class.  If attendance weren't required, I could have popped in for the midterm and final and pulled off at least a B range grade.  She is very helpful and takes time to make sure everyone is on the same page; this means class is slow and often boring, but why complain over a free A in a required course&#63;</div></div></div></body></html>
