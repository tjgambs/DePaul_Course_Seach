    Uninspiring. Aside from whatever 'knowledge' he possesses in this particular field, he has absolutely 0 talent in arousing student interest &amp; is as passionate as a stale piece of bread. I did extremely well on all assignments + extra credit, yet 'magically' got a B. (wtf&#63;&#63;&#63;) Find an instructor with more competence and clarity.

    This teacher is not very helpful and the class is very disorganized. He said attendance was not required, but then tried to crack down at the end of the quarter. I would recommend finding a different teacher.
