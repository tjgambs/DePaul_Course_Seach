She used a ton of examples of her own daughter growing up to help explain some theories and experiments that we learned about. She was super funny and made some hilarious comments while she was teaching! I would definitely recommend her. Very interesting class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2012<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved her. Very knowledgeable, and uses own stories/videos for aides. I asked many questions for clarification, and she was helpful and respectful and made me feel like all my questions were worth asking. Def get text bc exams are half text, half lecture, but you get to choose which essays on exams to do- so could do ones from lectures if easiest</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was by far one of the WORST teachers I have ever had throughout my college experience. She is not helpful and makes you feel uncomfortable if you ever have questions to ask. There is no study guide for any of the test and she never reviews the material out of the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2011<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are dry, but the material is interesting. 3 exams,non-cum. 50% of exam is from the lectures and 50% from the book. The only problem is that she never dicusses the book so you are on your own when it comes to studying. If you study the chapter outline, you should be fine. Okay class, but if you want to learn, take another class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2011<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HER! Her lectures are so unorganized and unstructured. Out of her lectures she includes only about 5% of the textbook and yet, she requires you to read all chps because info on those chapters will be included on the test. I hated that class. She is also a bit unclear and I think she should retire ASAP. Dont take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had her for Child Psych and she is NOT the professor you want, unless you love boring!She is the female version of that teacher in Ferris Bueller movie.  Yes she is smart and cited in the book and does crack some jokes.  HOWEVER for night class...seemed like forever. If you think you can focus, take her, but if you dont like boring dont.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is my favorite teacher at DePaul. She really knows her material, even cited in the textbook. Her class is easy if you attend and pay attention. As far as readings, you're on your own but if you read and understand the summaries, you'll be be good. Very helpful and she's hilarious. Very straight forward, highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2008<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Camras is very smart and knows her stuff. As long as you do the work, there is no reason you can't get an A. Her tests cover a lot but are not hard. But she is the one you want for Child Psych, especially if you are interested in it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2007<br>Class Name: PSYCH439<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had this professor a number of years ago. I found her to be unfair. When I went to her with questions, she seemed self-involved and contemptuous toward me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2007<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Camras knows her stuff! She's super funny and always makes jokes about celebrity gossip (espectially Tom & Katie).  She's a fun lady and is very easy to talk to.  Although there aren't very many grades in the class, she tells you exactly what she expects: attendance.  If you go to class you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2007<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very dry!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2007<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the biggest **** ever! One girl accused me and a friend of cheating & she was bias against us...wouldnt even listen to us...a hypocrite...Im graduating this year and im such a mess b/c this teacher doesnt want to listen to us...and both of us DID NOT CHEAT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2007<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You really have to read the book and study for the tests.  I didn't and my grade suffered.  The tests are worth most of your grade, but if you pay attention, you'll do fine.  She's really nice and very understanding and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2006<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Camras is a very good professor, but basically the three exams that she gives make up 90% of your grade (30% each).  She has an interesting personality and is very knowledgeable on the subject matter. Make sure that you attend class regularly even though its not mandatory and read the book and you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very knowledgable teacher. Her examples made me better understand her lectures. I don't know why others do not like her teaching. Her lectures were exceptionally awesome. :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: PSYCH330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Dr. Camras.  She has a great witty and pleasantly sarcastic personality.  Come to class (even though attendance is not mandatory) and you should do well on the tests.  Very fair grader.  She's a great professor.  Two thumbs up!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: CHILDPSYCH<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher and easy to understand.  Lots of material to cover on test between the book and lectures but tests are curved and fair. Interesting studies.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: CHILDPSYCH<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rather boring. Not mean, but a little rigid. Learning in her class was a chore, rather than an enthusiastic step toward our careers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2005<br>Class Name: CHILDPSYCH<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>all i have to say is....Bueller, Bueller</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: CHILDPSYCHOLOG<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most boring class I think I've had in my life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: CHILDPSYCH<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutly love this teacher. She is why I chose child psychology. I would only reccomend her class if you are a hard worker and want to challenge yourself and take advantage of what DePaul has to offer. Her voice is very monotone but her lectures are informative and the materical is interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: PSY555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Dr. Camras at the Graduate level. I would ONLY suggets you take her at the grad level. She has her own opinions that my be mistaken for fact, IF you are not familiar with OTHER researchers in the field. Also, does she &quot;teach&quot;&#63; or read her notes from folders from a seated position&#63; Reconsider..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does not ever shut up.

Is very knowledgeable and uses fun teaching methods.  I esp. enjoyed the discussion board on Blackboard.  Her class can be hard if you dont read or come to class, but if you put in the work an A is attainable</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2004<br>Class Name: PSY236<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Child psych...could kick my self now b/c a teacher I like is teaching it and this teacher is a wicked awful woman who can't teach for crap although is really smart.
