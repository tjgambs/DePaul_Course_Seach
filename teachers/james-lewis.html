Such a funny and relaxing class, and at the same time very interesting! Such a shame that he is leaving the country!

A great class to take at night.  This is by far the coolest class I have taken at DePaul.  Unfortunately he's moving.  Big Bummer!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2008<br>Class Name: REL212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jim's class was the most intresting class i took at DePaul.  Members from different religions come and talk to the class which makes the it fun.  Alot of reading, weekly quizzes, and a final paper.  As long as you read the material and participate you will do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2008<br>Class Name: REL212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the night class with him. He is awesome and his stories are hilarious. This is the easiest religion class you can take. There is no midterm or final, only a short quiz each week and a paper. Take the night class- you get out about 45 minutes early each week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2008<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jim is very funny guy! His life stories r 1 of a kind. The class is fairly easy, no midterm or final, kind of hard 6 quizzes, and 1 book review. Opportunities for extra credit if u participate in class. Take him 4 ur last class because half of the time the class will b canceled. *Sit in the front roll!* Can?t tell u y but u will thank me if you do?</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2008<br>Class Name: REL212<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jim is super fun. Quiz once a week. does not let you out early at all - would not suggest a night class. but otherwise class is really entertaining.</div></div></div></body></html>
