He gave us some knowledge about the location but mostly just let us roam. Final project was creating a photo book. Very easy compared to some DIscovers, but actually very fun and is very nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Jordan for Discover Photographing Chicago Landscapes. Each day during the quarter, we went to different areas of Chicago to take pictures. It was great! No papers, and the final was to create a photo book with descriptions of each location. So easy! He was also very willing to help with taking and editing photos. I'd definitely recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2013<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Schulman is amazing! He is by far my favorite art teacher that I've ever had! He is such a kind person and makes drawing super fun! I also learned a lot from him! :) I would highly recommend taking a class with him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2012<br>Class Name: ART323<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best photography teachers I have ever had, he knows what he is talking about and is actually helpful in critiquing your work. I learned so much with him and would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys photography. One class with him and you'll want to take anything he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2011<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jordan is a boss. take him and you will be wanting to take more classes with him. Class was basically painting and joking around!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I must agree with my colleague below, by all means take his LSP class for an extremely easy A. All you do is take photographs of about 20 different locations he has on the syllabus (half are in-class field trips) and present them to the class as your final. He is also a pretty cool guy so if you want a cool, calm, collected professor take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>PHOTOGRAPHING CHI-LANDSCAPES TAKE HIIMMMMMMM!!! never once did we stay the full time. So easy, we read a book but no test. ending final soooooooo easy. EASY A. lots of exploring and you can share pictures. one thing DONT BE LATE but otherwise take him whenever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2011<br>Class Name: ART224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy.  Expects you to be on time for class, which is completely reasonable and that you hand your assignments in on time.  Also, very reasonable.  The class itself was hands-on learning with the software and the camera itself.  No book was required.  All in all, a fun class.  As a non-art major, the class was challenging, not hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: ART225<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Schulman is a great professor! He demands a lot from you but it's expected in any art course, especially Photography which demands so much out of class time. He's pretty lenient with attendance and expects you to do a lot of the work on your own. If you're willing to put a lot of time, effort and get out of your comfort zone, you'll learn a lot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2008<br>Class Name: ART225<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Real easy going professor and pretty goofy. You practically work when you want, whether it's during class or not. As long as you get the word adequately done, you're fine. I'd recommend him for photography for sure but the costs are pretty high.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for a Explore Chicago class about photographing Chicago landscapes. Excellent teacher, I learned a lot about Chicago and how to actually enjoy and live in the city from him. He also had the world of photography creatively weaved into the class. Lots of fun field trips. Unfortunately he was a little over shadowed by a confusing TA.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2007<br>Class Name: ART220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great beginning photography professor!! Most classes were informal and very open.  Some days we just had labtime, attendance was optional(sorta). Assignments were challenging and fun.  Learned a lot and gave us much time to practice our technique.</div></div></div></body></html>
