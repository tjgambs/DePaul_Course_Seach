It is good because 308 is the most difficult accounting course. He only teaches nights, so lectures are long and boring because of that. He tells you most of what is on the exams and lets you use a note card in it.  Great professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2015<br>Class Name: 308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hug made consolidation easy and fun! I recommend him!! HE IS THE BEST! Weekly quizzes, midterm and final. He is straight forward. Nothing unexpected. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2015<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor. The midterm and final is based on the practice exams from the previous years and for the exercise he assigns from the book. You have to attend all his classes so you can get the credit for the quizzes as well, usually he distributes them by the end of the class. He is very straight forward and clear. I would take him again </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great!
