I loved all the lessons she taught. She was tough, but very understanding. Georgie is inherently  respectable. You want to do the work because you appreciate the things she does for you, rather than because you need to pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2014<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For my discover Chicago class I took Georgie's class Breaking the Glass: Privilege in Chicago. It's been one of the best classes I've taken so far here at college. She does a very good job helping you through the difficult material but it is hard and you have to work for it. But it's totally worth it.</div></div></div></body></html>
