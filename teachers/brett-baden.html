Nice goal however does little to get you there. In-class exercises are helpful since they show up on the exams. memos are time consuming. Lectures are boring and painful. esp if you ask a question b/c sometimes he confuses himself when trying to answer it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Epicly boring.  Reads straight from slides, with long pauses.  Makes material uninteresting.  Expects a TON out of you.  I learned some stuff, but very disappointed that he is actually allowed to teach as going to class was PAINFUL.  Tests are difficult, but doable.  He is responsive to questions though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared to work if you want an A.  You will read three texts + WSJ, mid-term, final, and three short papers.  Mid-term and final will wear your hand out and the papers are graded very hard.

Papers are graded unbelievably hard and mid-term and final will take every minute allocated without having a chance to review.  If you decide to take him, GOOD LUCK!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is horrible.  Be prepared to read three books and the Wall Street Journal.  Two tests which are beyond difficult if you don't put in a bunch of hours studying.  Three papers which he grades like a hawk and will take off points for minor grammar errors.  If you decide you're going to take him GOOD LUCK!</div></div></div></body></html>
