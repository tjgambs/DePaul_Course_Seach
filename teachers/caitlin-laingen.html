    It was obvious she loves her job teaching everything/anything about photography. Very flexible with students who use iPhones as their digital camera. My experience: I turned assignments 2-3 weeks late, came to about 5 classes total, decent job on photo projects, 75% on written midterm... GOT AN A! She's lenient, but don't take advantage of it!
