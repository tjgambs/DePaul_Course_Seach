He is into participation and would stop the class EVERY DAY and talk about how little people participated (not true btw) This took from learning and showed heavily in everyones papers. He claims to think outside the box, and supports going against the grain, but this is a ruse. Worst teacher yet at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2012<br>Class Name: SCU337<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely the worst professor I've ever had. Condescending and self-centered does not even begin to explain this guy. While I truly did appreciate the opportunity to discuss developmental theories with my fellow future teachers, I learned very, VERY little from this class. Not worth the time, effort, or money. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.</div></div></div></body></html>
