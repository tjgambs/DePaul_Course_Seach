No homework, just a midterm and final. She gives you previous exams to study from and the exams are almost identical to past exams and problems from class. The material itself is not easy but she explains everything really well and there are no surprises on the tests. Great professor, you don't need the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2015<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>No quizzes, just midterm, final, and weekly hw. Show up to class, follow her lecture packets, and do the hw. No textbook or access code needed. The hw is just like the class problems. She is the best accounting professor ever! Very clear, concise, and helpful. She lets you out of class early as much as possible. I would take her again and again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: 101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I have had so far. Clear and concise in what she wants while being able to convey the concepts successfully. No quizzes with short homework assignments. Gives 'additional problems' to prep for midterm and final. Often gives points back if you justify your reasoning. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2015<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Heltzer is an amazing teacher!! Her lectures were great, she shows a lot of interest and knowledge for accounting. She gives out these awesome lecture packets which really helped me study for the final and midterm. Accounting in general is tough but she made things clear and was always available when I had questions. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2015<br>Class Name: 101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Heltzer is one of the best accounting 101 teachers at DePaul. If you need to take 101, I would definitely recommend her. Her lecture notes are so clear and very helpful for the homework and exams. Prof. Heltzer made everything crystal clear and she truly cares about everyone in her classes. She gives practice exams for the midterm & final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2014<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Proffessor Heltzer is great! Never tries to trick you. No homework, just midterm and final. Gives you past exams to study from. She goes over things quickly and we often got out of class early, but you learn a lot and she goes through a ton of examples. Her note packets make the material easy to understand. I wish I could take her for 305 and 306!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed her class. I understood everything that was going on. All i did was study the packets she gave us for the midterm and final and received good grades on them. Super nice, taught fast but she gave you everything you needed that you needed on the test. Cancelled class a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This Professor was only helpful because of the lectures and practice midterm/final she gives out. Other than that, prepare to put a LOT of work in. She goes through the lectures FAST, probably so she can end the class early. However, this is a class where you need all the lecture time you can get.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is super cool and kinda funny but she teaches way too fast. she usually does cancel one day out of the week which gives no time for review. makes it easier to slack off. and fall behind.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wendy was an okay professor. She goes through all of the materials way too FAST and cancels one out of two class in the week. Horrible thing since you can't remember things from last class...She has a lot of opinion regarding DePaul and this class. I don't blame her though, ACC101 is so dumb. and the test are standardized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take her class! Very clear in her instruction. Lets you know which stuff is irrelevant in actual accounting but is required by the accounting department. One of my favorite professors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2012<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors Ive had. Quickly responds to emails. Sympathizes with students and is interested in having all of her students do the best they can. Teaches really well and really clearly. I would recommend her to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2011<br>Class Name: ACCY101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a wonderful teacher! SO clear and SO helpful! If you do her extra textbook problems they help a lot, and she responds to emails so fast. And she was VERY helpful and concerned whenever I had q's. Definitely loved taking her she's so encouraging and a wonderful professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes everything so clear you dont even need the books, she gives past tests with answers so you are fully prepared. If you dont pass her class... change your major!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's great and she almost always lets us out early. and the homework is so easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at Depaul. If you're majoring in Accounting you must take her! She really knows the material and all the short cuts. I'm not saying she's easy but she does prepare you in every way possible. Her lecture notes are crystal clear and she even has practice exams & you have to answer questions in class for grade points</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Heltzer is a really awesome professor, she is crystal clear and if you like accounting you should have no problem with this class. She gives previous midterms & finals to study from and they are very similar to the actual exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2011<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Heltzer is AMAZING. She is the nicest person, and such an awesome teacher. She is so organized and works so hard to make the accounting concepts clear. Her notes are stellar and she goes above and beyond to help students with anything. Wish I could take her for every accounting class, I will definitely miss her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an amazing professor. Her way of teaching is superb. She has practice finals/midterms on blackboard which are an exact replica of the official final/midterm you will take. The practice tests tell you how to solve every problem so for the real test you just go and follow exact format. If you get less than an A on her tests, change majors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BY FAR THE BEST PROFESSOR OUT THERE!! If you have had to retake this course take this teacher, she is super easy and explains everything. She even gives you hints on what the midterm and final will be like. There were only 4 F's and the rest were a C and above. AVG midterm grade was a B.  Not gonna find that in any other professors class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My only complaint is that she should give printed hand outs. It's hard to write notes and listen to wawt she is saying. I don't know wawt stupid researchers made the claim that taking notes help you absorb material, but it DOES NOT WORK.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very caring and always sending emails (scholarship, clubs, career related stuff). Midterm + Final. She doesn't check attendance so you get 5% FREE to your grade basically (If you don't show up to class and are majoring in ACC you are an idiot.) Has practice midterm and final on web. Mid+Final exact copy of practice tests just worded different</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She speaks to fast and nonstop. Hard to follow if you are not super focus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Phenomenol professor! She is smart and knows exactly how to teach accounting so that you understand EVERYTHING! If you pay attention in class and take notes, you are golden! I would take her again in a heartbeat.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>1 word......AMAZING! Her teaching method should be set as the standard for the rest of Accounting professors. She should be the head of the Acc. department, she's knowledgeable, intelligent, caring, and very experienced! If i had an accounting firm, she'll be the CEO!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The BEST accounting professor I've ever had. There are a lot of class notes but they're really helpful and EASY to understand. One midterm and one final. Study the notes and the practice exams she gives you and you'll be fine. She definitely prepares you for your following financial accounting courses.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher.

Prof. heltzer does an amazing job teaching accounting to intro students. Makes everything crystal. However, dont let this comment and all other comments fool you. You still have to work your ass off in accounting, no matter what teacher you may have.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Heltzer is honestly the BEST accounting teacher. i failed accounting twice before and with her help i got an A!! must take this professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Prof</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2009<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>had the time and money for a PHD but not cut out to be an acc profesr. Makes you copy down stacks of notes that she rites on the board instead of normally giving printouts like other profsrs.Cohen is better because he actually teaches you real business. All wendy does is say &quot;all rite guys lets get started, if you dont copy notes its disrespectful&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Heltzer is a great asset to the accounting department.  No pun intended.  She's kind of a rebel and marches to the beat of her own drum.  Crystal clear lesson plans, very very predictable homework and grading.  Not much else to say.  Great class great professor.  Take her for ACC101!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best!!! If you have to take Accounting 101, make sure it's with her. Her tests are very to the point, there is HW which is 20% of your grade so if you mess up on the exams, you will be good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the best professor I have had yet. Extremely clear; I didn't need the book. She does her job and expects you to do yours. Inspired me to pursue a CPA - ACC 102 will be the first time I am going to seek out a specific professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the best profeesor that I had at dePaul university.

Very little accountind professors with there phd like to dumb things up for you, but she does a great job trying to make everything as clear as possible. Print out the chapter outlines and study them for the midterm and final, do the hw, and the labs and you should get an A.

Uses lots of examples in the book and makes everything clear. You have to work because some of the material is difficult, she makes it as easy to understand as possible. Midterm and final are straight from what she teaches but they are long. Would love to take her again. Too bad she doesn't teach 305  instead of Cohen.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2007<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice and is easy pretty easy in general but you still have to study alot she will do a little review towards the end for the midterm and final ... take notes.

Whatever she teaches during class will be on the midterm. She's very down to earth and nice. You really do need to study for the midterm and final, they were about 12 pages-back to back, but if you study you should be okay.

I would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
