As long as she sees you putting in effort, you will be graded fairly. Despite that I'm neither a Lit nor Asian Studies major, I loved her class and wish I could have taken more with her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2010<br>Class Name: AAS290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professer I've ever had. Expect a lot of reading, and discussion every day. She sets aside time for every student to meet with her outside of class, about 40mins. She wants to know about your interests and help you in whatever capacity. Her classes are engaging and she is just amazing. I cannot recommend her enough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2010<br>Class Name: MOL308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great prof who takes a keen interest in her students on an individual level. Attendance is highly recommended because you'll miss a lot in discussion. Work is pretty much just a short blog response to readings. Easy. Interesting and fun. Grades are a cinch as long as you show intellectual effort which is easy bc the readings are provoking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: ENG389<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Miho is amazing. I had no interest in the course, it was just a requirement but she makes the subject material really interesting and the class ends up being really fun and laid back. Fastest hour and a half class all quarter</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2008<br>Class Name: MOL310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Miho's Geisha course, and I have to say that it is one of the best classes I have taken at DePaul or anywhere else!  Miho is sweet and funny and energetic, and (most importantly) she cares about her students and wants them to do well.  Take her if you can.  You will learn alot more and have much more fun than you anticipate!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2007<br>Class Name: JPN201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is hilarious. Take her. She's very helpful and will go into detail explaining the course material, but she does veer from the schedule a bit. She's a REALLY hard grader and does assign a mountain of coursework. Her class is HARD. However, she really cares about her students and will try to get to know you, so you won't just be a face.</div></div></div></body></html>
