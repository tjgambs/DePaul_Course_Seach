    Dude, this man can make you excited about 4 million year old skeletons. He really loves what he does and it shows and he wants you to love it too. When you sit there in arch class youll find yourself contemplating becoming an archaeologist in Mexico because he lays out the finer points of the profession. Then you leave and say wtf was i thinking. Well this is rambling but seriously hes great.

    Awesome professor.  Powerpoint presentations each day made class a lot more than just a lecture.  Midterm and Final were take-home essay questions that were decently hard.  This was his last time teaching at DePaul however, which is too bad.

    Middleton was one of my best teachers at depaul! He's inspiring in the fact that the man LOVES what he does. Everyone should have a passion for something like this man does for archeaology. Very interesting class, awesome as one of your pre-1800 histories

    Okay wow EASY. Take home midterm &amp; final...he suggests that you work in groups for every lab and short paper (which i did), and in class assignments guarantee you an A. VERY EASY A, if you do NOTHING you'll at least get a B. He is funny and always EXCITED
