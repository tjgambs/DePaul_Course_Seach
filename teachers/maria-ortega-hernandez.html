She is an insanely hard grader, and takes off points for word choice. Even if you use a proper synonym for a word, she takes points off if it isn't the word she wants you to use. She is a difficult grader, and when you go to her office hours, she just tells you you're bad at Spanish and to see a tutor. Highly recommend not taking. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2015<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting and fun lectures; she's upbeat and funny. Four long compositions are each 10% of your grade  and she is a VERY hard grader--first teacher I've ever had whose averages were usually around 65%. If you work hard for it, she rewards you. Makes an effort to know her students</div></div></div></body></html>
