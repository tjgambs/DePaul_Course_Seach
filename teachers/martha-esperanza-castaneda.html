She has unique ideas and encourages great conversation in her class. She likes to sit with her students rather than lecture at them from the front of the room, and she is very very very helpful. She's not at all jaded, and really into her profession.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: SPANISH104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really easy</div></div></div></body></html>
