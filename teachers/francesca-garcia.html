She is by far one of the most helpful professors I have ever taken. She always answers emails and reviews tests and quizzes in class to make sure we understand the material. She is very strict about class though. Do not take her/class lightly for she won't hesitate to call you out</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2010<br>Class Name: NSG200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned so much about how to live a healthy lifestyle. The professor is not hostile at all unless you completely disregard her rules. The syllabus says no phones or talking in class. She WILL call you out if you ignore the rules. She is so willing to talk about the class and even career goals with you. Attend class and the tests are very doable.</div></div></div></body></html>
