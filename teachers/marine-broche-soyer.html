Couple of the hardest classes my freshman year, but learned a lot.  No final, but grammar+ vocab test every couple weeks+ 3-4 mini essays. LOTS of exercise book work, but also does poem analysis, film analysis, things to keep you interested.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2005<br>Class Name: FCHPRACTICUM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>veryy nice and sweet. always willing to help and answer questions. she's not too hard with grading either.

Very sweet, soft-spoken, informative, sometimes funny, native-speaker. Always open to answering questions (grammatical/cultural/etc) and does so until you understand. Approachable and fair. Recommended :)</div></div></div></body></html>
