Yes, she is demanding. She is strict. You have to work hard. But no one else is as loyal as she is. No one is more relentless; she will never give up on you. She is a wonderful person and you are lucky if you get the chance to be in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2009<br>Class Name: TTS201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The skills I took away from speak outs are applicable to all academia and everyday life. I listen to myself, use more active voice and have a thought through idea before speaking. It sounds silly, but I learned really important lessons even when she was really harsh on me. The tears were worth the lessons.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2009<br>Class Name: INTRO210<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As previously stated her teaching style SCREAMS of insecurity, she does things just so she can bring her students down a notch and make herself seem the be all end all of the world. Name dropper to the max, if at all possible AVOID THIS CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2008<br>Class Name: TTS412<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is one reason that Lenora has changed her tune: TENURE. This woman does not deserve it, as she finds it impossible to communicate with her students. Instead she rips them down, and can never find 1 positive thing to say. If she is the person shaping the future of American Theatre, as she claims she wants, theatre is going to suck!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2008<br>Class Name: THEA511<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Our playwriting program suffered b/c of her presence. At play readings, she openly laughed AT students WHILE they are talking- she was a guest, NOT in charge. Her teaching was underhanded because she is adversarial. Her manner of speech =incomprehensible. Her behavior SCREAMS insecurity. I feel sorry for her -she needs so much adoration. TAKE NOTE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2008<br>Class Name: TTSTION<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Any recent kindness she displays is to save her reputation and job. Intelligent, hard-working students are exhausted dealing with her cutting criticisms, in-class break downs, using students for her professional advancement, and severely inappropriate personal judgements. There is an end in sight.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: THE212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It appears that Lenora was a lot nicer to our class (the class of 2011) than any years prior. Even so, I loved the class and I thought she was a great teacher. Why she changed so rapidly, I have no idea. But I got a LOT out of her and her class. Thanks Lenora!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2008<br>Class Name: THE212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lenora confuses me. She is brilliant, and a wonderful teacher and I would love to take a class with her again, but I honestly cant figure out why people are reacting so negatively to her. She has been nothing but and incredible help. Her class is intense, yes, but I have learned more in her class then in all my years working in theater.  She deman</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2008<br>Class Name: THE212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lenora Brown is a caring and helpful person. Before coming into the class I had based my opinion on what I had heard from others, and I was very surprised at how they had talked about this woman. She has helped me so much with my writing, and I feel that if she did not push me to use my knowledge nothing would be learned.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2008<br>Class Name: THE212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just because Lenora doesn't spoon feed you info doesn't mean shes a bad teacher. She's a teacher that cares about students enough to tell them when they're wrong and why. The class is damn hard but so is life. She isn't a teacher you can charm with fancy writing and get an A. You'll work your ass off but what you get in the end is totally worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2007<br>Class Name: THE490<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lenora is the worst.  She contradicts herself, takes things on a personal level, and makes you work for nothing.  She acts like YOU came up with the wrong ideas, she'll make you cry and tell you that that says something about yourself, and if she doesn't like you, her mood will reflect on your grade.  All you need is luck!  Ah, tenure&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2007<br>Class Name: THE212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While in the class, you are feeled with fear and frustration. It is a very hard class, probably the hardest class you will take but after the class is done, it is one of the most rewarding classes you will ever take. Not only does she open the students minds to different thoughts about theatre but she teaches better writing and communication skills</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2007<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seems to enjoy when students feel extremely overwhelmed by the work she assigns.  I have never put SO much work into one class before...and still I received a B.  I have a 3.8!  The grades were clearly subjective; based more on charm of the student than actual dedication to understanding the material and completing the numerous lengthy assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2007<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Brown is a very intelligent woman, I like her a lot! She gives new insights about the curriculum.  She challenges me! One minor point is that the readings are too much.. The texts are not clear buit we need to write essays about it.. ai!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2006<br>Class Name: INTROSA<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2006<br>Class Name: THE<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are not in the theatre school you probably shouldn't take this professor, unless you are ready to be challenged. But for those in TTS she is one of the best profs; Brilliant, demanding, and truly committed to her students. It is sad that next year's freshmen will not experience her, as it is our &quot;cut&quot; system.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2006<br>Class Name: THEATRE<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2006<br>Class Name: THE<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Raving ****.

I thought this would be one of the easy ones for the quarter- nope. she's arrogant and tends to go into accents that she does not have. i didn't learn a thing and i think i got a C even though i went to class and read. bull sh*t. - and she yells at you like youre in 5th grade.

She gave everyone in the class the wrong grade because she forgot to factor in the midterm grade. When I called her out on giving me a B when I knew I deserved an A, it took her forever to fix the problem and she wasn't apologetic. Don't take a class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: THE212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really isn't that bad.

She is always helpful and I just love her.  This woman has changed my life and I will never forget her for it. She will take her own time out of class to help students with their personal problems.

Her class was great, but then again, I love to write. When I was having a hard time with a personal issue, she took time out of her schedule to ask me what was up.

When you step into her classroom come with your A game. The work is intense, but she really prepares you for college level writing and speaking. Most people are bitter towards her, because she didn't kiss their ass.
