    Great professor who is always there to help. Very funny and is clear about everything. Midterm  is easy if you study the review she gives you and for the final, you have a group project to do which is not hard at all. Overall, best professor and would take it again.

    Jen in AWESOME! She's super funny and makes class interesting. The midterm is super easy and you almost don't even need to read the book because she goes over everything in class but even if you do its pretty interesting. I took it as a freshman and loved it!

    Jen is an awesome teacher and is really funny. She is really straight forward and gets straight to the point. The papers are straight forward and is only one project due at the end of the year that is done with a group.

    One of the best I've had at DePaul to date. She's very helpful, caring, and respectful of everyone in the classroom. I had to miss class to go home, which resulted in two classes in a row being absent. She had no issues with it, responded to my email questions, and told me it was ok to miss class as long as I emailed. Take her class!

    SHE IS AMAZING!!! She is super fun, but she teaches you. She relates things to actual things. She is nice and doesn't teach anything unnecessary. If you look at the review she gives you for the midterm you are sure to get a 100. I got a 99.

    Jen is hilarious! You have to take her class; she's hands-down THE most entertaining lecturer I've ever had at DePaul. Her assignments are generally pretty interesting, too, and she explains the material in a fairly straightforward manner for easy retention.

    Jennifer was an awesome teacher! She is very knowledgeable about the subject which makes it easier to understand the material. The textbooks were used more for reference, so try to rent them from the public library if possible.

    Jen is AWESOME! She's hilarious, easygoing, and passionate. Don't be afraid to speak up in class and participate, because it's just a fun class and she will take your comments and expand on it. Very high energy. She will occasionally be slightly confusing but will always, always, always clarify if you ask. Her assignments are not hard at all.

    Great professor. If you wanna learn the basic of Screenwriting and become a better writer, take her! Also, she loves Transformers so be sure to mention that. Plus, she's kinda cute in a goofy, fun way!

    Enthusiastic and knowledgeable; it's refreshing to have a prof who has worked (and continues to work) in the field of study (screenwriting) that she's teaching. Provides fantastic feedback on drafts and writing exercises. If you do the work, you're guaranteed to finish the course as a better, more skilled writer.
