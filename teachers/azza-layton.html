With that being said she is very passionate about her discipline. Her class was awesome, but extremely difficult. She included interesting texts. Lots of reading. 1 midterm that required you to recall the smallest details from the lectures, texts, etc and a final 15 pg paper. Not for slackers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2010<br>Class Name: PSC100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want a challenging poly sci class that tells it how it is take hers.

If poly sci is not something that you find interesting do not take this class!! It is based on her opinions and nothing to do with the text. She assigns way too much reading and takes it personal when you dont read. She really doesnt know how to teach and her lectures all over the place. Do Not Take!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2010<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice lady, sometimes funny, but all her lectures are based on her opinions. Whenever she has the chance to bring up her middle eastern background (Egyptian, I think), she will. Basically, when she teaches the class, she is looking at the book and is going page by page. Few 2 page papers now and then, not too hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: POL120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was an amazing teacher.

The material was cut and dry.  You read, then take tests...pretty standard.  I enjoyed the classes in which we had class discussions about current events, but otherwise it was her lecturing to the class.  She has a great sense of humor though!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a tough professor when it comes to midterms and finals. She words the text so differently that it is hard to get an A on the tests. She does however give extra credit and try to help you. She is very opinionated and discusses her personal and religious beliefs during class way too much. Despite that, shes a good prof</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2008<br>Class Name: PSC319<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED HER..yes, she is scary..why b/c she hates slackers..therefore u cant bs the readings. I learned a LOT, and she teaches you how to THINK as oppose to force feeding you info. Tough in class, BUT very fair grader if you read, and are prepared. Unlike most poli sc classes- an A is achievable!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2008<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First professor I have felt let down by.  Very bias and opinionated, which got in the way of her being a good professor.  She was unwilling to help or even make the effort to help.  Your grade is not worth the risk of taking her, because she does not &quot;grade by the book.&quot;  Take her at your own risk.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An intense and passionate woman.  Layton has a lot to offer those student who are willing to listen to her.  She is outspoken and opinionated - definitely, but if you're ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTION and not just showing up crabby and hung over you will find that she may be one of the most interesting professors you will ever encounter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher.

I took her three times actually. You HAVE to read the book. Just do the work and she'll love you. If you don't, she'll let you know that she's disappointed.

You have to read the chapters, otherwise you will fall too far behind.  She is exactly what a poli sci teacher should be, knowledgeble, honest and controversial.  I will take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very good professor if you are interested in the class. She is very knowledgeable and you will learn a lot. If you listen to the way she tells you to study, there is no way you will not get a good grade in the class. She even gives the essay questions before the exams, so you can prepare!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2006<br>Class Name: PSC393<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a teacher worth taking in the political science department. Believed that the class was about social movements opposing globalization, but never really covered that subject matter in class. Even worse, the seminar format was a poor use of class time, and she fails to provide any new insight into globalization, just the liberal critique of it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>From reading some of the other comments, it seems that this professor has really improved.  She expects her students to do the assigned reading and care about coming to class.  She takes students' comments seriously and even does mid-quarter evaluations to assess her performance.  This is a challending but rewarding class and an interesting prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked her and thought she was great at breaking down the reading. She likes class discussion and really tries to grade you on HOW MUCH YOU TRY. Students cry that she treats the class like kids, but I think she is just trying to give breaks. She is BIG on attendance- so SHOW UP. Read and take good notes on the readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2006<br>Class Name: POLMIDEAST<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really: AVOID This woman.  She has some instability issues.  She locks the door and if you walk in 5 minutes late she treats you like a grade schooler.  She holds personal grudges, and is kind of off balance.  Someone needs to stand up and make sure she doesnt get tenure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2005<br>Class Name: AMPREPOLICY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Once you leave the university none of these professors matter. Layton has MORE problems with emotional and mental stability than most, but to avoid her periods of instability(DON'T TAKE HER CLASSES). Go into the world and become a great success and then invite their poor behinds over to dinner in your home that they will never be able to afford.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2005<br>Class Name: INT406<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Layton is one of the most challenging professors I've had. She's also one of the most inspiring, so if you're in college to actually learn something and not just pass classes, take her without a second thought. Maybe not your average American prof who takes care of the little students, but you will remember her lectures for a long time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2005<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's not an evil witch. She is liberal,she is oppinonated, but she is very passionate about what she teaches.  What she talks about in class isn't important for tests, so read the book!The only reason i didnt like her was because she treated the class like kids, always lecturing about grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the worst teacher that I have had at DePaul.
