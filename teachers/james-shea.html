Really cares about what his students write and gives genuine feedback. HILARIOUS if you listen to him. He's kinda weird at times but that's part of his charm. I have a major crush on him. HOT stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Focal Point Seminar - Chinese Poetry. Very nice guy! Quite knowledgable and helpful. Really funny if you pay attention to what he says. His voice is very soothing and kinda boring, but you miss his charm and wit by not listening. This class was way easy! I dont know if theyll offer this class again, but take it if they do!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2008<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I won't lie: he can be very boring if you don't have a love for the subject. But I thought he was an excellent coach for aspiring new writers. He is a thoughtful grader but not overly difficult, and is genuinely interested in helping you mature as an author/poet. He adjusts his advice to your own style, which is rare and valuable in a writing prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2008<br>Class Name: WRD101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE is pretty cool as a teacher, it takes some time to get use too him but my friends and i had game which was to obsereve him and when he smiled  or laughed because he barely smiled at the beginning but the end of our course he like our class!! bridge!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice professor and average grader.  He talks in a monotone, so grab a cup of coffee before you go!  Workload for class was average, but if you keep on track of assignments it goes pretty fast.  Only complaints were there was not enough class discussion and we never got out early.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes you do some grammar work like what you already did in high school, his lectures are pretty boring, and there is a ton of writing, but that should be expected of an English class. He's really helpful though if you ask him for help on papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is kinda... no really boring but it is not too bad. He is awkward and say ok A LOT... but it isnt too bad</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2007<br>Class Name: MOL321<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring class time; takes a crack at personality once in a blue moon. Expect to write no less than &quot;30 pages&quot; of essay/response per class. Graded on quantity of work; becomes deducible if otherwise. Must've killed a couple dozen trees with all the handouts we had to print for class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring as hell. Inconsistant grading. Take another professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best english class I have had. Class discussions are great and paper topics are interesting. Easy grader too. Talks in monotone and might need a few seconds to gather thoughts but other than that, a great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2006<br>Class Name: ENG389<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor and has a passion for his subject. The workload is below average for a lit. course and he is a generous grader. Take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's kinda an odd guy. He seems to get lost sometimes in his own little world but not too hard of a grader. I thought I'd be lucky with a B but I ended up getting an A along with many others. He's not too hard but don't hand anything in late</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most people didn't like him because he is a little odd. But it all adds to the flavor. He's very helpful and he's not a harsh grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shea's ENG 102 class was pretty easy.I didnt think it was possible for him to give out A's either but I ended up with one for my final grade. He is a good guy and pretty helpful. He is boring to listen to, but he can have some funny moments. A lot of reference to the Japanese.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He wont give you an A but he is easy and he loves to give out B's.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, with about 7 eassays. Topics are somewhat easy.  I thought I was gonna fall asleep though and my class was at 12. He talks really slow... and... with big... pauses.So that's the only minus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Looking to his profile, he is also a Japanese History teacher. It explains a lot why we are reading Japanese Essays, watching Japanese movies, and writing in Japanese format. But they're somewhat easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: CPL319<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a great teacher and his lectures are very interesting. he goes in a lot of directions with interpretation, so if you have an interest in literature, take the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: COMAPRATIVELIT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He plays favorites like no one else. So if you like sucking up, then you'll get a good grade. The readings were interesting, but he doesn't make you feel comfortable talking about 'em in class. yuck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall he is a good teacher. His class is fun and his sense of humor helped make the time go by fast. Paper topics are interesting and he allows you to use your creativity. He is a thoughtful grader, especially with papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not a bad teacher he is actually pretty cool and laid back.  I would take him again just a couple papers that weren't too bad, but some papers were political.  Basically it wasn't too bad and just proofread your papers he is a fair grader on paper. Oh yeah he also rarely gives out A's, only A-</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2004<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an interesting guy.

Monotone took on a new meaning when I took this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for a night class and the class went by so slow. He is an ok grader, but hearing him talk for 3 hours was horrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never calls on people during class. Readings are usually short and easy. He is a fairly strict grader on papers, though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is just plain awesome! I liked the class disussions that took place and as he made the time fly by. I thought that the class was extremely easy and the professor makes it worth your while.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: ENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
