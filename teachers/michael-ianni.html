Really funny. Easy enough class and he really cares about his students. The only thing that sucks is that attendance is super mandatory. It's a breeze otherwise.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2013<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mike is a great guy, he really cares about his students progress as business professionals. He makes you earn your grades and is a meticulous grader. He connects classwork to real world situations and truly develops the students into more professional individuals. If you show him that you care and he see your improvement, you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2013<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, really involved with the class. MKT 376 Communication was a game changer for me. But, Ianni was a tough (final) grader. He says he gives A's, but most of the class got B's and C's. I learned a lot though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2013<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>376 was a life changer, it significantly improved my communication skills inside and outside of the workplace. It makes you realize that the majority of the workforce is ignorant and unprofessional. Ianni is a great professor, the best I've had at DePaul. Take the course seriously because you will use the material throughout your entire career.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am not really sure how to feel about Ianni. He was fair and clear on his expectations. Not lenient whatsoever though. Not very good at responding to emails. I took a night class. He would come from work and you could tell when he had a stressful day. The class itself is very useful though, and he is generally enthusiastic, so it is not a bad time</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2012<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the best professor I had this quarter. I took him at night you not only get to leave early when you are finished with your assignments. He is very interested in the topic, and a great professor who knows his stuff</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2012<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Professor. I took the night class and it not only flew by, it was fun as well. He keeps the class involved. Easy A, make sure you do your projects and everything on time. Also this class does require you to present in front of the class! Overall great guy and hopefully in the long run I can run into him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2011<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be warned: It's a speech class! If you're in commerce you have to take a class like this anyway so do it with this guy. Super laid back, really fun guy. Don't buy the book you wont need it. 2 group projects that are easy. He picks your group.</div></div></div></body></html>
