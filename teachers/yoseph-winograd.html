His assignments require the use of the program SPSS and Excel and he covers this piece heavily. Unfortunately, when it comes to his exams, it's all manual calculations which is material he barely teaches in class. He is not helpful at all!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2009<br>Class Name: ECT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this professor, if you don't have to. I was a DL student and I had a hard time understanding his strong accent. He grades kinda unfairly and does not accept late homework. A textbook is not required, but if you are familiar with the programming language C# you should do fine in this class. I wouldn't recommend him though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2008<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yossi speaks softly and has a strong accent. That said, I had no problem understanding what he was saying. He is very fair. His exams are open book/notes/whatever - and his classes are well planned - to the minute. The material was easy. Sure the clases are not exciting - it is a statistics course!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2008<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow, this guys is not easy to pay attention to. i feel like he's very set in his ways, and although the class itself is pretty easy, it's challenging to get through to him. it's also impossible to pay attention, so i would never reccomend him for a night class. overall, the class was completely boring and pointless.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2008<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this professor. There were technical problems with submitting the midterm so half of our class just didn't get credit. I also had to miss class for a funeral and even though I notified him in advance, it was an unexcused absence and I lost points. You do not want to deal with him, believe me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: CSC239<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not that great of a professor....it was an easy A but it was really boring and basically repeated everything we learned in BMS 142.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2007<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher, but class is very boring. There's no need to go to class, just watch it on COL. Attendance isn't required. I went to class 3 times. Twice because I had to take the exams. The grade is based on HW, midterm, and final. HW is based off of in class exercises. I would take his class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2007<br>Class Name: IT230<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had to withdraw from the class because he never replied to my emails asking for help and was never available.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2007<br>Class Name: IT430<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy to keep up if lectures are attended.

If you pay a bit of attention you will be fine.

He seems like a very nice guy but his lectures will put you to sleep within 15 minutes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2006<br>Class Name: IT430<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His examples in class were inadequate and irrelevant.

He is very helpful and understanding. The class consists of several HW assignments, a couple of easy quizzes, midterm and final. The lectures are recorded so if you miss a class you can see it online.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2006<br>Class Name: CSC239<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not too hard. all info is on line. hard to understand some times with accent. nice guy. boring lectures. info not hard to understand.  two quizes with midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was neither amazed not impressed. For as many discoveries and exciting things that happened while I took this class, I also fell asleep.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2005<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm sure he's an ok prof, but he's gettin old and contrary to what others have written he ain't all that nice and helpful. Won't clarify assignment  questions and confuses people. Trust me, take better teachers</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: ECT355<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First time, apparently, he taught a class seriously, and apparently doesn't know how to do it well. Classes were completely useless. It seemed like a senior project class, yet we had midterms, finals and weekly essays. Overall it was easy, but WAY too much work for a non-senior project class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2005<br>Class Name: ECT353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this man for any ECT class that he teaches. He knows his stuff and his classes are somewhat entertaining. Also, VERY lenient on classroom behavior, attendance, and HW deadlines.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2005<br>Class Name: CSC319<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not a difficult grader and he has an upbeat attitude, I recommend taking his class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2004<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor took his class three times and he is very helpful.  His style of teaching is amazing changing the code around.  Best way to learn any of his courses.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: IS375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>excellent teacher, love him, taken 3 class w/him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: IS375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>excellent teacher!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
