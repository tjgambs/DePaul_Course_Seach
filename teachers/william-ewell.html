    Ewell asks for a lot from all of his students, but it's effective. He takes personal offense at disrespectful behavior from his students, whether it's complaining about the reading or being bored or anything, and he's 100% right. He is a great professor, and if you don't pay attention, you are missing a great opportunity to advance your writing.

    I don't normally feel inclined to write reviews on here but after taking his class, I just needed to. He was an AMAZING professor. On the first day, he came off as a hardass but after that, he was extremely nice. He's very helpful and always listens to his student's ideas. I signed up for another one of his classes b/c he's so awesome! TAKE HIM!!!

    Professor Ewell is great! yeah, you have to read and be prepared for class discussion, just like any English class, and when you are, it's a breeze. I really enjoyed the class as well as the class discussion. he's a no-nonesense kinda guy so don't expect to slack off and get an A

    I loved going to this class. Professor Ewell always kept discussion interesting. There was not a lot of work outside of class. Aside from reading poems previous to class discussions, there were only two papers. I HIGHLY recommend taking a class with him, especially "Reading Poetry!"

    very smug english professor type.  very little to do with multiculturalism, very tough grader, assignments and exams are all written papers, grades for writing style and grammar, not ideas.

    Very Mediocre. Class is a bit dull and the novels aren't given their due. He's young and inexperienced, which explains his less than dynamic teaching methods.

    I didn't really enjoy this class because I felt like it was rushed. I also felt like we never got too in depth with the novels we were reading, and often found that I could get more information from Wikipedia or sparknotes. I usually don't use these resources, but I was so unsatisfied with the class discussions and analysis.

    I had Ewell for my creative writing class. I liked the class overall and found it interesting, although he could try to make his students a bit more inspired since it is one of the first English major classes. He has a very dry personality, but my class had fun anyways and I liked that the atmosphere was always very light and comfortable.
