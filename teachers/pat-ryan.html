He is a great teacher. He really tries to get you to think. As a mentor, he is fantastic. He's straightforward and will call you out, but not a jerk about it. He knows the program in and out. I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2005<br>Class Name: FOUNDATIONS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pat is great.  He rambles quite a  bit but really likes to work with students to develop ideas and engage them in conversation.  Straightforward, sometimes crass but always kind.  He is also my Faculty Advisor and I'm very glad about that.</div></div></div></body></html>
