She was a teacher at columbia, and you will hear her talk about that on several occasions.

What a waste of the school's money. I took her as a nite class and America's Next Top Model would be on, so I would go downstairs to the caf and watch t.v then come back to class. Sometimes she let us leave. You will come to discover that it is easy to learn Avid on your own.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2005<br>Class Name: NONLINEAR1<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the person below.  Although she is very cool, she didn't have any cool projects... and I didn't learn anything.  This however isn't 100% her fault.  We are dealing with the free downloadable AVID!  Why don't we just download the manual and program and learn it ourself&#63; this is horrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2004<br>Class Name: DCNONLINEAR1<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow, she didnt know what she was doing and our class suffered for that.
