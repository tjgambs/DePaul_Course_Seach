    I really liked this professor so after seeing how bad the reviews were I wanted to write something. If you read the textbook before lecture, show up for lecture, and do a decent job on the group project you will be just fine. Its really not hard if you show up prepared to every class. If you don't want to do that take someone else.

    Overall there is no working with this guy. You email him about concerns or problems you are having and he is not helpful or willing to work with you. He is rude. He does not show you your grades, you have no idea how well you are doing as his grades he gives are like weird check marks. No direction on how to study as there is no midterm only final

    Don't take him. Avoid him, Avoid him Avoid him. very hard grader. attendance is required. doesn't give any extra credit. and not flexible with his explanations. he will want you to learn the material his own way and if you don't then its going to be hard for you to get a good grade. his exams are hard and weird.

    class was so interesting and I learned so much. He gives real situations and current examples. Hes a guru and will really grill you to make sure you know what your talking about. Great guy and funny to learn with in class. Test are straight from slides, just study and you can get an A if your work is correct of course

    Mr. Geva is the type of person who shows no concern for making his class comprehensible and spends most of his time telling the class nonsensical stories about his glory days of working in advertising. I was interested in taking the only advertising class at DePaul until I learned he was teaching it. Do not take any class with this man.

    Did everything he asked. Except I forgot to write a 1 page Reflection on what i've learned. He gave me a D+. Got A on midterm, A on the presentation, C- oN the final (told us to study "x" and he test us on "y") and an A in consumer journal. He is a rude man who picks on younger students. I cannot believe he is still a teacher at depaul? Fire him!!

    He's really not as bad as these reviews say he is. This was an intro to marketing class and he was FULL of knowledge and LOTS of experience. He's harsh sometimes but he knows his stuff. I recommend taking him. This is COLLEGE, it's supposed to be challenging. I learned more in his class that I did in my others. Marketing isn't supposed to be easy.

    In 4 years of college, Geva ranks among the worst I have ever had. Very unclear about what he wants. Tells you to study Chapter 3 and quizzes you on Chapter 4. Smart person but terrible teacher, simply relates anecdotes you have probably heard before and all the famous "business stories". Talks about his BMW and how great they are, and Nike. AVOID

    AWFUL professor. No midterm. Final, group project, random quiz grades,and a consumer diary. The final is obviously cumulative, since there was no midterm, and it had pointless questions. Make sure you ask questions if you are unclear, even though he seems irritated to answer questions. Keep all records of the grades you receive in this class!

    STAY AWAY FROM THIS GUY! The worst teacher I ever had! Arrogant, rude, absolutely useless in terms of teaching and help. Does not explain what he wants from the class. Always blames the class if something goes wrong during the lecture. If you do not want to guess what you suppose to do the whole semester do not take his class!!!

    If you want to to have to worst professor in college history, take this guy's class. I feel less of depaul for hiring this monster of a professor. He is EXTREMELY rude, doesn't help you out when you ask for help, and will pick on people he doesn't like. I feel he compromises depaul's integrity by being the anti-professor. Meaning he is out to destr

    Horrible teacher! he has great knowledge of consumer behavior, but he is a horrible teacher who should be in a position to give people grades. Every day we go over the powerpoint from the book, and that is it. All assignments are very vague and he doesn't tell what he really wants so it's left for interpretation, and if you don't do what he wants,

    One of the worst classes I've ever taken in seven years of higher education. Very unclear, picks on people, gets irritated when asked for clarification.  No one in class understood what the assignments were, even after asking twice for clarification. He kept changing the requirements.

    2 Projects and a final for the entire class. Attendance is taken every class and Professor Geva reads straight from the book every class. He is an easy grader, but is unclear on his expectations and grading scale. Going into the final- no one in our class knew what grade we had. Overall- decent class.. Geva is an interesting fellow.

    This guy is bizarre. Half of the class is spent talking about how his BMW is AWESOME, and all American cars suck. Give me a break. Very arrogant and unclear as to what he wants. Never gave any direction on either of the group projects. Gave us no insight as to what would be on the test. Most of the class was a guessing game. Easy grader, though.

    Although he is VERY knowledgeable, this guy is strange. There are no point values on anything he grades, you just get a letter grade with little comments. You never know where you stand in the class.  The class wasn't so bad, just be sure to participate and meet with him outside of class like he suggests.

    He's very intimidating. He WILL pick on you. He wants you to know the concepts and talk to him in marketing terms. He expects that you have read the chapters before coming to class. Quiz was easy. We had no final. Diary NEEDS to be detailed. Almost your entire grade is based on the Group presentation which he does not explains what he is expecting
