She is a bit intimidating a first, but don't be scared. She is really helpful and will work with you individually. The class was a lot of work at the beginning but it gets easier. It was helpful to front load the work because when I got to finals all my work was done. I really enjoyed taking her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enjoyed her class.  Attendance is mandatory but she makes the class fun.  You don't typically get out of class too early.
