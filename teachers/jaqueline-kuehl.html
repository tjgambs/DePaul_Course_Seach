A couple papers that she grades leniently. There's also online category management tests to take that she reviews at the end of the qtr. I did them all in one day, they're not difficult. She's very nice and funny. Take this class for a marketing elective (all 3 CatMan classes are pretty easy + interesting).  No book, no final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2011<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Professor!

Take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2011<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's such a nice pro,very helpful, just read some cases,not so much homework. two case analysis paper, one team presentation. very easy, i would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is my second class with Kuehl (I took her for MKT 380).  Again, she is probably my favorite teacher at DePaul. She is a pretty easy grader and she tells you EXACTLY what she wants. Brings a lot of real world experience...and sometimes brings her entourage (her sons) if they are home sick from school. She is simply an amazing professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2010<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its a case study based class so you have to read for every class.  She is very clear on what she wants for lengthy papers so just follow the guidleines and you will be fine.  Brings lots of real world experience to the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2010<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fairly easy class but you do learn a lot.  Many real world experience cases.  Papers are long but if you plan your time wisely, it's not too bad. Midterm paper, final paper, group paper, and individual paper. Prof Kuehl is fun and keeps an easygoing classroom setting.  Presentations are somewhat boring but overall, good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2010<br>Class Name: ADMKT359<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has interesting stories and real world experience. Class consists of paper for midterm and final on any company you want and a group presentation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2010<br>Class Name: MKT380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great professor! interesting class with a lot of real life topics! easy grader, interesting in-class activities. you will learn a lot :) TAKE HER</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesnt know how to teach. She grades inconsistently. Group presentation. 1 paper, then final paper. Her criterias are vague. I dont think she knows what she wants from the students. Lets us out and hr early every class. She shouldnt be a teacher. I wouldnt take her again. It would be nice to learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: MKT380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A class, i took two classes with her this quauter n i got  As in both of them.. u dont do anything.. just submit ur assingment on time.. n u are good to go</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2009<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class but you don't learn a single thing. She always lets you out really early. The classes are just groups presenting case studies which gets really boring and is worthless. Nice professor and is very knowledgable in the subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Make sure to be prepared for the quizes because they can either strongly help or hurt your grade. Marketing plans an auto A, for e-scan make sure to follow directions. The problem with the final is that its more of an opiniated questioneer and only like 10% textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great instructor.
