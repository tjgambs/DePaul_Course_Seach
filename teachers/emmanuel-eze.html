Required obscene amounts of writing from students for the time given. Unwilling to work himself or show up for class on time. This was a summer class and he was writing a book. Maybe he's better during the regular quarter, but his personal interest should never interfere with teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy sucks.

With that said, this is the first professor I had who actually understood what the underlying themes were in my essays.

Sometimes class is rough because it seems like he expects a lot out of you, but he grades easily. He just wants you to get a basic grasp of the concepts. He's really excited about what he teachers. You'll end up with a decent grade just by showing up and using Sparknotes.

He's horrible! First he says his books are not that much but one book a week is a lot. He can care less if you have other classes, so don't look for any sympathy on his part.
