    Finance is all about investments. By taking Harper you are investing in a great sleep. But honestly, he knows his material and teaches, but is extermely dull. I did well by attending each class, taking good notes, and didn't even own a book. Keep up to date with h/w though he doesn't go over all, it is good practice.

    Good prof. He doesn't require attendance but all of his quiz and tests are from class notes and homework problems. Grading: Quiz1 10%, Midterm 40%, Quiz2 10%, Final 40%. He does curve. I say take him!!

    One of the worse teachers I have ever had at DePaul! If you are stuck on something, he will not help you. One final and one midterm, two small quizzes which are all hard. He has told me to go to the 'tutoring center' but no one is there to tutor. I asked if I can email him w questions says Yes, I guess you can try that.  I had to pay a tutor to hel

    Ok...this is the true rating of this teacher.I took as my last option and did extremely good in his class. His curves are the best.  His voice is low and no energy in teaching.  His test/quiz are hard as hell. His teaching is not that bad. Take him and get a good grade by just reading the chapter and do his problems and you shld be fine.

    He is a pretty good teacher. Very nice guy overall. His classes can be a bit boring at times but he does what he can to keep them interesting. He knows a lot so he shares very valuable information that isn't in the book. The quizzes and tests are straight forward and he curves. If you go to class to learn and not for entertainment he is great!

    I got a B in his class. I came to his lectures I didn't do any of the homework, but I REALLY studied for the midterm and the final. He isn't a bad guy, but I just didn't find the class to be presented in an interesting way.

    Professor Harper is one of the true great teachers of finance. Not only he teaches you the fundamentals as the course describes he explains the material what the text perceives. Sure the exams and the quizes are a bit tricky but do the problems and read the text because it is based on concepts and you will do great. Total points will be curved.

    boring, hard to distinguish what he is teaching from the book and what he is simply adding into lectures from his own work experience. Quizzes and tests aren't horrible and DOES give healthy curve when grading but DON'T feel as though I've learned much of anything.

    I have no idea why everyone is giving him a bad review. Just go to his class, take notes!  For exams, just study the examples he gives you and study the notes REALLY well.  You will at least get a B.  His test problems are similar to homework.  Also, the test averages are like 50% but he gives a very healty curve!!!

    The book was more helpful to me. His lectures are boring; the quizzes (2) are helpful though so don't miss them...they give you an idea of the question that will be on the exams.

    Class is really boring.  I'm not a fiance major, so, i really had no interest.  Nice guy, just very dull and boring.  Hard to schedule time wtih him since he is only part time.  Just d the homework, and you'll get by with atleast a B.

    Harper is a nice guy but he CAN NOT TEACH. Avoid him at all costs. His notes are soooo unclear and he expects you to already know everything coming into the class. I had to teach myself everything in this course and chances are, you will too. Grade consists of 2 quizes, midterm, and final. Huge curve in class because everyone does so bad!

    I really dont think Harper is hard. Does know subject well, just not well at teaching it. I didnt really put forth the effort I should have in the class, otherwise I would have gotten an A. My buddy did the HW, went to class everyday, and put forth the effort ending in an A. I still received a B by just going to class and taking notes.

    i thought he did a good job explaining the subject matter. i was able to do really well on exams just by going off his notes/lectures and not even reading the book. very structured and organized. tests are tricky and each question counts for a percentage point, although i think small curve is involved. if you show up and take notes, you'll be fine.

    2 quizzes are ok.....Final and midterm very difficult (a lot of tough questions that weren't covered as well as expected), but he does curve which helps a lot.  Reading the book helped too.  Most of calculations on test were like those from homework, but he through in a few tough ones.
