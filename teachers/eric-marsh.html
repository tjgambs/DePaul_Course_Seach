He is very knowledgeable and passionate about his subject, and is interesting to listen to! He makes it easy to learn and participate in class, and he is a great and funny human being. No tests in this class - just a few papers and weekly movie reflections. You will regret not taking him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2015<br>Class Name: DC270MANN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marsh is hands down the most down to earth professor I've had at DePaul. I'm a senior so I've had my fair share. He comes off more as a good friend talking about a subject you both love, but still maintains the position of professor. Needless to say I was impressed by his teaching style and wish I could go back for more classes with him. Simply #1 </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2015<br>Class Name: DC100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, Prof. Marsh was one of the best teachers I had at DePaul. He makes every class really interesting and fun. No midtermsfinals, only papers that were really interesting to write. I highly recommend! </div></div></div></body></html>
