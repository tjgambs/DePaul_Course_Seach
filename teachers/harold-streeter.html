If the professor ever endeavored to verify whether his course was "user centered", he's realize how hypocritical his   teaching methods, tests, and assignments are to the beliefs he professes in "</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2015<br>Class Name: HCI440<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Organized guy but def not an easy goer. Has attitude issues which made him unapproachable. Uses grader to grade papers, which sucks. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2015<br>Class Name: HCI440<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a dream start to my Masters in HCI at DePaul University. The professor clearly put a lot of work and thought into every little detail about the course - the lectures, course content, logistics, grading criteria, course objectives; basically everything! Finishing this class gave me a great sense of accomplishment.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2015<br>Class Name: HCI440<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Clearly one of the good guys.  He's reasonable.  He really puts time and effort into his classes, his lecture slides, and figuring out how to make classes better for students.  He helps.  He takes his job seriously and it shows.  Only negative is the grading is a bit too harsh.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2014<br>Class Name: SE430<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very organized and clear on schedulegrading etc. Not an easy grader but that isn't a bad thing for the kind of money you pay at DePaul, if nothing else you are there to be challenged. All I look for in a professor is someone who has organized material, a clear set of expectations, and answers questions clearly and quickly. He delivers on these.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2014<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a fan of this guy.  He is totally unclear with his expectations for most assignments, and grades harshly when you don't understand.  He has no flexibility, and he goes off on random stories that make no sense and show how socially awkward he is.  I most definitely will not take another course with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart, knows what he's talking about, uses real world examples to simplify things. Quizzes and exams (all  openbook) and group projects check to see if u've really understood the material, they are challenging. But everything is from his ppt slides, know them well. Lets students meet over google hangout. Study the slides well and u'll do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2013<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A must take course for anyone who wants to learn about OO modeling ,design and requirement. Quizzes can be hard but nothing outside from his lectures or slides. The exam was easy but challenging. He replies very fast to emails and guide you to a solution. In general take this course its a must in any computer major</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: HCI440<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear professor when it comes to HCI knowledge. He responded to group emails fast and efficient and his assignments helped me learn new things in the HCI domain. Overall take his course</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2013<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Streeter is a great teacher but the Final was a killer. The quizs and assignments were ok.. but the final can ruin your grade. He does NOT curve the grade either..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class online, it was okay.  Professor Streeter really is passionate about this subject and shares a lot of examples to relate to the course material.  Overall the class is pretty fair and straight forward; don't fall behind and you will do fine.  There were two quizzes and one final which were not too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: IS421<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty easy course so long as you stay on top of assignments.  This was his first year teaching it, so he was putting together material on the fly.  He ditched the textbook altogether, which was helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2012<br>Class Name: SE477<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Streeter breaks it down into "Barny" terms and keeps the class interesting at all times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2012<br>Class Name: SE529<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is helpful and u can learn alot from this class.

He explains everything crystal clear and tells real life stories for a subject. You won?t get bored so easily in his class.In his assignments, you will learn how to design a real life system step by step(no coding required.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2011<br>Class Name: SE529<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned a lot in his risk management class. he was very friendly and helpful to everyone .

Challenging class but worth the effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2008<br>Class Name: SE477<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found this class to be very boring as Harold only reads off of his slides.  The keys to success in the class is knowing his slides (exams are open book) and having a good project team.  Definitely take online if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: SE477<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Appreciate his efforts in compiling all useful textbooks into his presentation slides. No need to get any textbook because his slides are more than helpful! Streeter is good in explaining and he absolutely knows what he is trying to convey! GOOD & had fun in his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2007<br>Class Name: SESECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great teacher, responds to e-mails instantly...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2006<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took his photography class for Explore. Great guy, interesting life story. But if you are seriously interested in photography or want to really learn about Chicago don't get your hopes up too high. No previous photography experience needed to pass this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2006<br>Class Name: SE430<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared to spend about 10 hours per week on his lengthy assignments.  This Professor thinks that we have nothing else to do in our life than his long drawn out assignments every week!  There was no down time in this class and it absorbed all of my time even from my other classes and my life in general.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2006<br>Class Name: SE430<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor!I was worried about this class, however this prof explains the concepts in layman's terms.HW assignments aren't too hard but very time consuming.Exams are all online using Blackboard. However, don't let this fool you.You need to know and understand the subject to do well on the exams.Just go in wanting to learn, you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: SE430<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knowledgable but hard in grading</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2006<br>Class Name: SE430<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>v</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: SE430<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was very uncertain about this class because the concepts seemed technical to me. But although they still are, he teaches it very well. It is well organized and his examples help the material sink in. Very dry sense of humor :). The only teacher who can teach such heavy stuff and not have me leave after the break!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2005<br>Class Name: SE450SE430<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I ever had. I am taking every class he teaches...so much to learn from him. Very organized, explains very well. Makes you use your head, so classes are not very easy, but they are very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2005<br>Class Name: THRUTHELENS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: EXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i did not have him for CTI class so im sure this was different.  but for those taking him for explore, hes a nice guy and it is obvious he really wants his students to enjoy class.  however kind of boring and we had to use poloraids for all our pictures-but still a good class for Explore Chicago</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2005<br>Class Name: SE430<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful, very clear, and very fair.  Probably one of the best professors I have had in DePaul CTI.  I learned a lot and was never overwhelmed.  If you get the work done, and follow his notes, you'll do very well in the class and learn the material.</div></div></div></body></html>
