She really has a passion for what she does and does not hesitate to share it. That being said, if your ideology about activism does not resonate with her and the many books you read, she is not much help, and she seems to only know her way.  It's a very biased class. Not fun unless you are passionate about it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: WGS320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ann is the best person on the planet.

Ann is an absolute saint of a woman who clearly knows her****. Unfortunately, her standards are too low and she is too willing to make concessions to busy students whose outside activism she (understandably) admires.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: ANYWMS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ann is by far the smartest professor at DePaul.
