Lectures were really boring but often were good substitute for actual text. Tests were pretty straight forward.Overall, very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2011<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy with a genuine interest in the subject, but lectures are boring. The first few classes will be fine but you will shortly find it extremely hard to sit through them, he just does Powerpoints of the textbook. Homework is light and easy, tests aren't too bad and he drops the lowest grade. If you have patience the class is fine to take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2011<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A nice guy and definitely seems to want people to learn. Assignments are pretty easy if you do them, but the tests are a lot harder.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2011<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes jokes and has detailed slides. Lots of stories about research projects, etc. Tests aren't easy but not the worst overall grading is pretty fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: PSY205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Currently a psychology major and love the subject. I'm a fan of the textbook, as it has a website component that's great for self-quizzing. I wound up with an A in Gutierrez's class but I found his lectures extremely dull, as he just copied and pasted images from the text into powerpoint and summarized for 90 minutes. Left early regularly or slept.</div></div></div></body></html>
