In spite of that , the teacher cooperates and attempts his best to explain concepts with practical applications.

He is a great help if you can get him one on one, but otherwise he is not the best teacher and cannot convey a lecture properly. Also, this was by far the hardest class I have ever taken in my life without a doubt. If you are interested in the subject, you can get by and will learn a lot, but stay away if not</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2014<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Class was straightforward for me, class had a structure.

I only look before I pick and choose classes. However, I felt that it was that important to let your students know that this professor is the worst I have ever had at DePaul! He is knowledgeable but does not know how to apply that to us students. I strongly do not recommend taking him. Plain and simple</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2014<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really awful and confusing for a student who knows nothing about economics. I still feel after this class like I do not understand economics. Additionally he had a grader so he never even looked at what we did wrong on the homework. His questions were very confusing and DO NOT take his class is you can help it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a good old math class.

He's hard to meet with, which you need to do for the project. Worse, the project is due the week AFTER finals...Exams aren't too bad, especially because you can have 1-2 pages of double-sided cheat sheets</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very difficult to understand. Did not explain concepts clearly. I relied mostly on book & internet to learn material. Soft-spoken & semmingly uninterested most of course. Time-consuming homework & some quite unnecessarily. The final was ridiculous!  Half the class didn't finish in over 3 hrs & ended up bringing my A down to a B-.  AVOID!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took stats 5 years ago. I didn't remember much of it. I had never taken calculus. I learned A LOT in this class. The textbook is very clear. Read the chapters AHEAD OF TIME. If you do that, you can use the lectures to build on what you read. If you don't, you'll be lost in class, and you'll play catch-up all quarter long. Advice for ANY class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2013<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got a bad grade in this class but it was mainly my fault. I didn't take it seriously and thought I could get by by just reading the notes. He is helpful though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2013<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have not taken math/stats/calc in a long time, take this class w/ Biner. I took calc 5 years ago, so the calc/early stats was very easy. I think Biner goes at a slower pace for those who have not taken a math class in a while. The regression portion of the class is rushed, but I'm sure it is for all classes. Overall, good experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2013<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was a hard class but doing the homework helped, I liked the math aspect of it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2013<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attending the class was quite helpful in my case.

Does not help at all, is not clear on any material. Tests you on concepts completely irrelevant to the course. Always off topic, setting students up for failure. I am a straight A student and received a C in this class.To portray how he is, we did not get our final grades until 3 days after they were due. Avoid this guy!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: ECON106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TERRIBLE teacher.

He's good at the math but I don't think he should be teaching a conceptual class.  Also, he should change his attendance policy.  It should be mandatory or else everyone will fail.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His homework is hard but good study guides for his exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teaches very fast and reads straight from the powerpoint. It's a hard class where you end up teaching yourself most of the material. His 3 HW assignments take forever and he is very vague about what to study for on the exams. Knows his material but he can't teach it to students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall a hard class because he teaches more material than what the book covers but if you can do his homework you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He read off powerpoints that we all had access too.

Homework were not a big problem, just takes a longer time. The main problems are midterms and final exam. Both are extremely hard. Always finish the essay questions in the back first, they are worth way more than multiple choice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2011<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard to comprehend.

You need to read going to class is not mandatory but he explains everything you need to know for the assignments for the most part in class. Great teacher just a little hard.</div></div></div></body></html>
