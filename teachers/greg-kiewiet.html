He was often disorganized and most assignments and classes were a waste of time. He was very unclear in what he wanted in his assignments which added unnecessary stress to the class. Seriously, I would suggest not taking him, and if you have him drop him ASAP for a better professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy really does not know how to teach. He's a cool guy that tries to be funny at times but is very unclear. He is highly disorganized and is always changing the syllabis. Doesn't grade more than half the assignments you do and for the first 8 weeks all my grade was, was a Check Plus. Impossible grader also. Do Not Take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this class. Professor Kiewiet is never prepared and extremely disorganized. He is by far the worst teacher I've had at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TO be completely honest, he's not a bad person. But he is unclear, unfair, and constantly contradicting himself. He will become incredibly angry and unforgiving at random times, while at other times he will just sit in front of the class silently. Even when we aren't talking. He will not give you a grade until the last week of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher. Doesnt explain anything clearly at all. Just take my advice and dont take him at all. I could teach better than him and I'm not even a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2009<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the worst teacher I have EVER had.  He doesn't grade most of the homework and he just wastes your time.  You will sit in class and not learn****.  He doesn't follow the syllabus and he doesn't give you a grade until like 8 weeks into the class. DO NOT TAKE HIM. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. HE WILL MESS YOUR GRADES UP.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2008<br>Class Name: WRC108<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont take his class it is boring and he always changes assignments and he does not fallow the syllabus.
