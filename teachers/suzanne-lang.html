She directs like a professional but allows us to explore our own unique strengths as actors. Lang is entertaining, intelligent and hilarious. The entire class bonded in the first week. No homework, just show up and have the greatest hour an a half ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2013<br>Class Name: PRF380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What an amazing woman!
