He is so bad that I decided not to take the games physics class because he is teaching it and I know I would not learn anything. The main problem is that he does not know the material that he is trying to teach and because of that, he is trying to teach something else that he knows about; architecture/engineering.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: GAM245<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jacek doesn't know what he's talking about in the subject, and clearly doesn't understand the core principles. He is a bad teacher, and highly unreasonable in his grading. He teaches nothing of any use and squelchs creative freedom throughout class. If you want to torture yourself, take Jacek in Game 244, 245, and any class he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: GAME245<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its true that Jack give a lot of work, but anyone willing to take the time will learn a lot. The other students who have posted here have most likely not been able to meet his standards so believe he is a bad professor. All you have to do is listen to his directions and follow them, its that simple, but be prepared to do massive amounts of it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2006<br>Class Name: GAM245<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, material on basics of internet and web design.

That does in no way equate to being a good teacher. In fact, I hated his class. Unfortunately he's the only one who teaches GAM 245 at the moment. Crap.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: GAM245<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy but a horrible teacher.

No help, poor assignments, imperious attitude.  Makes people work in teams, and your whole grade is based upon midterm and final benchmarks, so if your teammates mess up, you get slapped with the penalty.  Prime example of why earning a PhD doesn't necessarily qualify someone to teach at the university level.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: GAME<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His in class demonstrations are something aweful. He provides examples on making games that are so limited that it is nearly impossible to use that information in your own games. He has sort of a monotone voice so it is easy to drown him out because the class gets boring.</div></div></div></body></html>
