She's STILL there&#63;  I didn't like her 10 years ago when she was student teaching.  I still have nightmares about shadows on cave walls.  She was hot at least in 1996, can't speak to if that's the case now though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2005<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is probably the most incosiderate teacher I have ever had. She expects us to work on her class 10 hours/week outside of class and believe me, it takes that much time. Not to mention, she is incredibly stupid. She doesn't understand the material any more than the rest of the class. Tests= very difficult. Over half of our class dropped.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2005<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A bad professor and a bad person. This is the worst professor I have ever had. She failed to live up to her own expectations of class and did not take responsibilty for her actions. This class has caused me and my classmates a lot of greif. Most students received bad grades. Stay Away!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2005<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This Professor is REALLY BAD-I thought that she may be different actually taking the course but I was wrong!!! Like half of the class dropped it. Save yourself time and MONEY and DONT take this class!!! You will regret it. She is NOT helpful at all even in his office hours. DePaul needs to FIRE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2005<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was by far the worst teacher i have ever had.She gets mad when u ask questions, tells u to be quiet if u try to get a word in.Her lectures make no sense because she assumes we should know everything becuase she does.I managed to get a B thanks to my bf who helped me with everything.Do NOT TAKE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: EXPLORECHICAGO<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, this woman has never cracked a smile and has no personality.Lectures are sooo boring and she keeps you there until the last minute.

However, she's not too bad if you don't let her attitude get to you. Remember it's only five weeks. She's also one of those profs that waits til the last minute to post final grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well-informed and interesting.

Pagliaro is a professor who shows unfavored bias towards certain ethnic students and certain students who have so-called &quot;different religious backrounds.&quot; I found her personally offensive, and filed a formal complaint and I don't think she's teaching anymore.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2004<br>Class Name: ISPS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Susanna is wonderful. She is as difficult as any college professor - it is not high school and she does not take absences lightly. Susanna genuinely cares about her students. She is a great professor and friend. I highly recommend her to everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2004<br>Class Name: ISPEXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awful.. i dropped her class because she just seemed really cold.. no compassion for teaching or helping students.. its her way or the highway.. and she shouldnt be teaching</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/17/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>when it comes down to atittude she is terrible! i took a course on sexual harrassment in america and she seems to be a hypocrite! she harrasses anyone who comes late by continuously staring at them. someone else needs to be teaching this course!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very rude teacher, doesnt know what she is taking about.
