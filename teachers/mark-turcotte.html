No need to buy the books, just show up to see him and you'll have a good time.  honestly, on the floor laughing almost every class. his indian jokes are amazing. everybody gets an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>By far best professor I've ever taken. Too bad I'm an ORGC major and not English. He is actually native american poetwriter and teaches classes about native american literature. He relates class material with "indian sightings" of what students have seen outside class. He completely changed my pov on modern native americans.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest class I've taken because it's all effort graded papers. Also the most frustrating class I've taken because the professor makes very offensive, general claims about students. Don't take his multiculturalism class if you have an opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Turcotte is really passionate about what he teaches. He gives back great advice and is easily accessible through e-mail. Made class and assignments fun, definitely would take him again! Great sense of humor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2013<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool prof. Do the readings and assignments, be on time and participate/pay attention. He is very knowledgeable and has a lot of interesting stories. I would take him again and recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2013<br>Class Name: NATIVELIT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor and man. He has so many stories and is a great speaker/writer. Definitely opened my eyes with the books and discussions we had. I told everyone I know to take this class - not too difficult, just keep up with readings, turn in responses (he gives you a 100 for just turning them in), talk, and enjoy yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gets a 5 out of 5 as far as being a great person. As far as writing goes, he doesn't always provide adequate feedback to student's pieces and relies too much on peer-review, which is often questionably beneficial. The main benefit of this class, however, is instilling a passion for creative writing. At the very least, it is an entertaining class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2013<br>Class Name: ENG209<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Turcotte is THE MAN.  Take his class, end of story.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2012<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is amazing. If you're an english major, do yourself a favor and take him -- you won't regret it. He is very helpful toward his student and will help make you a better writer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor! His class isn't difficult but you still get a ton out of it. He's a writer himself and knows his stuff. Very encouraging to his students, and funny. And read his poetry! It's phenomenal!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2010<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is the best professor I have had at DePaul hands down. In fact, I still talk to him to this day. He is very laid back and doesn't demand much of you but you will learn a lot from him. He is an amazing writer and taught me a lot of incredibly useful things. This class is great because it's very easy to get an A but you still learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2010<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Turcotte is one of the coolest teachers at DePaul. You can just tell how much he loves writing and he doesn't tear you down in his grading he helps you so much. I looked forward to going to his class everyday I cant believe he only has one rating. Just get to class on time and participate. He is AWESOME.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2010<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the best professor I have ever had. His assignments were basically all interesting and fun: he gives you a format and let's you run with it how you want. Mostly focused on fiction writing btu poetry was there as well. Grades very easily and was just an overall knowledgeable and enjoyable teacher. Definitely reccomend!</div></div></div></body></html>
