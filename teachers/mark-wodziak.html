Mark really opened my eyes to the many issues that immigrants and the 2nd generation experience. Class is not difficult. You read 2 super interesting books and write a few short papers. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most inspiring professors that I have had at DePaul.

He's huge on class discussions and there are weekly reaction papers based on readings so you'll have to do a little work, but if you come prepared to discuss class will go much faster. Not a hard grader on papers, either. Brings complex racial issues to life - you can tell he's passionate about what he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wodziak is awesome.  All you have to do is come prepared and participate.  He is young and super hot.  I can't wait to take another one of his classes.  The only con is that there are too many papers (although they are usually short)...I'm more of a multiple choice person.  Learn with confidence, you can't go wrong with Professor Wodziak.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2007<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a really great Professor, made the class interesting and was more class dicussions then lectures on interesting topics dealing with our society.

I learned a lot in his class. Grades were based on writing papers. So, there is some work, but he's not a tough grader.I highly recommend his class.

He's so cool and always let's us out early.  A lot of reading but you can basically skim.  No midterm or final, just papers for both.
