    Cancelled class every other week. We were behind 3 weeks in the readings and homework! Still hasn't opened my final and there's only 3 days left to get my grade in. He's passionate but I would recommend taking somebody else.

    You are actually graded on your participation in class including what you say. Numerous assignments consisting writing and reading, takes lots of your time. Don't take if you are expecting a filler class for GE. A bit hard to write in philosophy if this is your first course in the subject.

    You need to be ready to read the reading papers and write your responses on every film watched and paper read. After all you are in school to study no? You get graded on your personal thoughts on the materials, so there is no right answer. What better course?

    You have to love reading to get the best out of this class, and you employ your common sense a lot in analyzing. Clearly, the professor is passionate about the course. Just be passionate too and apply the readings in your daily experiential life. It helps!

    Philosophy is hard in general, and you have to read it over many times. I understood what we were reading in classs because he described it really well.. You actually have to think about what you are reading and comprehend it. I

    He is very unclear and not helpful and a slow grader, but not the hardest class.
