    I loved this teacher. He Knows what he is talking about; he is very well educated. He is also pretty funny. Just do your homework, come to class and use the practice midterms and finals

    Nice guy with acute little Icelandic accent. This is just simple math. Homework and quizzes are done online and it's so easy to do well. He is willing to help with any questions you have. Goes over material in class but I honestly, amongst most of kids just surfed the web while he talked. Always get to leave early too

    Uses mymathlab so you don't learn a lot since you can just answer questions multiple times. He explains problems and whatnot well though. Midterm and final were written mult choice but really easy.

    I really disliked this professor because his voice is so muffled and quiet that even if you sit in the front row you can't hear every  word.  Also I hated that he puts a due date on the coursecompass homework, unlike other professors, when its perfectly possible to keep it open.  He doesn't even have to grade the homework!!!

    THEE MOST CONSISTENT. Meaning, if u prepare(not memorize, but learn/understand), it will pay off. Promise. He teaches primarly thru example problems...I loved it.  Weekly quizzes and hw, one mid-term, and one final. Everything is straight forward. He doesn't try to trick you. He's a nice, approchable human being...I would take him again anyday.

    Overall a pretty decent class. You might have to teach yourself sometimes because he tends to teach things more complicated than they actually are. Other times he's awesome. Homework and quizzes are online, so there is no reason to do bad. 2 midterms and a final. He gives you VERY similar practice tests before each. I recommend this class!

    He knows how to teach but can be boring. Don't like his grading system. A total of 4 quizzes are given throughout the semester, each worth 10 percent, and each containing 5 difficult questions. So those total 20 questions will pretty much determine your grade which really sucks.

    I thought this class was hard and I am a straight A student. He does go over the material extremely in depth, almost too the point where he runs out of lecture time. Be prepared to study a lot on your own. There is homework assigned weekly but it is extremely helpful as his quizzes derive from similar homework examples.

    He was good. id say possibly one of the best... its not an easy class but if you keep up with everything you will do fine. He was awesome up until after the final then his teaching started to go a bit downhill. Overall I'd say he was good! if you can I would take him.

    Probably the best math teacher I have ever had. He goes through everything step by step and is more than willing to answer questions. Very approachable.
