I found it easier than ENG 201, which is an intro to creative writing. The main difference is that you must write two short stories instead of one. There is also a writing exercise due each class. The prof was very kind and helpful when students wanted advice on revisions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2012<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was very helpul n workshop and getting you to think outside the "norm" for your writing. She HATES cliches, so don't bother taking her class unless youre creative and willing to change your ideas if necessary. But her feedback is rather useful (esp. in her 1-on-1 meetings). She's pretty strict, so don't slack off if you plan on taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2012<br>Class Name: ENG307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Johns-Trissler is amazing. Always willing to help, gives amazing feed back on writing, and gives a reasonable amount of work. She's an excellent professor, and I've learned more from her about writing then I have from others.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2011<br>Class Name: ENG291<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class. Read the book, 1 page writing exercises due every class, 2 short stories(1,500 - 2,200 words)and in-class writing assignments, which she wants us to read out loud. There are also workshops for the two short stories.There is a portfolio at the end of the quarter that is due. No test. She is willing to help any student.</div></div></div></body></html>
