    Jim is very smart. His class is super engaging. He is very funny, and is incredibly knowledgable. You will learn a lot from his class. Show up, take notes, study, you will do fine. This class has no tricks or games to 'doing well.' Jim is one of the best teachers I've ever had.

    Best teacher at DePaul! he is extremely enthusiastic and entreataining. Makes sure all students understand and are able to apply the concepts in real life. Exams are very straigh forward, and a final group project that really brings home all the concepts. He is very nice and always available to talk to. I recommend him 100%
