Uses easy to understand examples to give you insight to basic financial investment tools.  Do the quizzes, which are nearly the same as the midterm and final.  Really laid back guy and teaches you a lot.  Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class wasn't that bad, but you don't really learn anything. The lectures are also very boring. If you're a finance major, I suggest someone else. A  joke class is not a good way to start your finance career -- you'll be a step behind. Also, the "practice exam" was worthless, just study the quizzes. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Gamble is the MAN! You're allowed a cheatsheet for all quizzes, you're allowed unlimited retakes on d2l quizzes which are easy, and his lectures make finance relatable to daily life and easily memorable. The guy is hilarious too! I have an A+ in the class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! One of my favorites at DePaul. He made finance easy and interesting. You do not need the book. The class is made up of weekly in class quizzes which you have a cheat sheet piece of paper for every test and then weekly homework assignments. No midterm and cumulative final with a cheat sheet as well. Definitely recommend taking him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A.

Such an easy class! No book or finance lab needed to do well in this class! Professor Gamble is always available for help (you will not need it).

He has weekly quizzes which can get out out of the final exam.  He gives you lots of opportunities to get an A (extra credit, counting quizzes twice instead of final, etc.) Always available and helpful in office hours and always answers emails in a timely fashion.  He understands FIN 315 is a required class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although the subject is not extremely difficult he provides really challenge tests that makes you nuts, however he's an excellent professor and is always open to help his students, so you end up with more than a good grasp on the subject.
