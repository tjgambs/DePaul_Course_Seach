We used literature and not academic work to explore ethical dilemmas which I thought was interesting and engaging.  Great course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2011<br>Class Name: MPS590<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible! When the 'Rate my Professor' survey asked me to rate her as either hard or easy it was hard for me to make a selection because she's just confusing, the assignments did not reflect the material. She is older and, with all due respect, needs to retire. Her teaching quality was disappointing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2011<br>Class Name: MPS590<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does not know what she is doing, she just gives us &quot;busy work&quot;. Taking her class makes me feel like I am wasting my money. I am in graduate school to learn and be challenged and instead I sit in class hearing her lectures on material that is not related to the class. I feel that she at times does not know what she is supposed to be teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2011<br>Class Name: MPS502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Though this nun is rather conservative, she's excellent at maintaining a fair and balanced debate atmosphere in the classroom. The primarily literary fiction assigned in ethics is an nice break from standard textbooks. She's always available to students & is no-nonsense. Don't ask direct questions unless you want direct answers. She's good.</div></div></div></body></html>
