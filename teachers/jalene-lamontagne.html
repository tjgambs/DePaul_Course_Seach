She made some remarks in class that were surprising. Overall she's a harder teacher to understand, so study a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2015<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor LaMontagne is one of the best biology professors I've ever had and she makes ecology an intriguing subject. She's very sweet and the lectures are interesting. As long as you read the book and review lecture notes instead of cramming, you're guaranteed to do well in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2014<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Dr. LaMontagne. She would write her notes on an overhead as she spoke so she never moved too quickly. She always listed the objectives for the day so we knew ahead of time what we would be covering. She used a lot of examples, graphs and diagrams to explain theories and experiments. She was wonderful and very helpful in lab as well!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2014<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! She clearly outlined the class everyday. Told you what you needed to know and what to study for the exams, she taught nothing more and nothing less. Great professor show up and get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, easy to understand. She writes out notes with you so she doesn't go too fast.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2012<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is not impossible to get an A in this course. If you actually put in the work and are willing to think critically it can be a really fun and engaging class. It's not easy, but also not impossible. Dr. LaMontagne is very helpful and wants you to understand Ecology so ASK QUESTIONS! She is great!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2012<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great teacher! She wanted us to THINK about the material instead of just memorizing stuff. It's a challenging class but the workload isn't too heavy and it's not really harder than other classes (midterm average of over 75%). Make sure to go to lecture and she seems to be genuinely happy to help outside of lecture. You'll learn a lot from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best profs I have ever had. I had to study like crazy to get an A but have never learned so much. Her tests are challenging, but she is accessible outside of lecture for questions. This is not a blow-off class, so if you aren't interested don't waste your, or anyone else's time! I would recommend her to anyone who is eager to learn!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2012<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, but nearly impossible to get an A.  Doesn't matter if you understand material, her tests are almost impossible to get an A.  Midterm average was 66% last year and 72% for the second one this year (she was happy with a 72%).  Do no take this class if you LOVE trees, plants, calculus and studying like crazy only to get a C.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2012<br>Class Name: BIO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great prof!
