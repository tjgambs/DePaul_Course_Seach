Speaking from my perspective, I thought his class was easy but you learned a lot.  He explains it in a way for everyone to understand.  His notes are super helpful.  You fill them in as he goes along and has questions for you to answer to help you. 3 total exams: 1 b4 midterms, 1 shortly after midterms, then final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2015<br>Class Name: ACC543<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Out of the many prof's I've had through the years, Mike Trendell is by far my favorite. He is the kind of teacher who cares about students learning, not about filling the air with useless talk or filling his 3 hour time commitment with garbage. Not to mention, he has a great sense of humor! Honestly, he's makes accounting fun. Highly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2015<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His outlines are very helpful, but he sometimes rushes through the material without much explanation. He likes to joke around a lot and by the middle of the quarter it got old and a little annoying. One group project and three tests. Would take again. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2014<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Lays out everything that will be on the exams and quizzes.

Great guy and great teacher. End of class quizzes about every other day, in which he drops the lowest score. Uses note packets, rarely uses the book. Great real life examples. Our midterm was take-home, but only because it was a summer class. VERY helpful guy, you won't regret taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2013<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Trendell was an amazing professor.

Very knowledgeable about the subject, ton of related work experience. Notes are key but you will need the textbook as well. He spends time outside of class to help. Crystal clear in his explanations.

Take him if you have a chance! He knows how to deliver and explain information. Smart, funny, and cheerful. Easy course if you are willing to study.
