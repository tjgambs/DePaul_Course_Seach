I enjoyed the material she covered and in class discussions were always good. Must do the assigned reading reading and come class to do well. This was my first CMN and I enjoyed it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: COMM211<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely terrible. If you've taken Comm 101 then don't waste your time with this class. She absolutely plays favorites and has way too high of expectations from students. Her class and teaching styles are very similar of an elementary school teacher. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2010<br>Class Name: CMN211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is absolutely the worst teacher in the world.  She picks favorites.  If she doesn't like you she tries to fail you...I'm a dean's list student and she's giving me a C.  She's an idiot, with dumb rules, she thinks she is funny, and she is an awful teacher.  She's HORRIBLY SUBJECTIVE AND UNFAIR.  AVOID HER AT ALL COST!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor is awful, the entire course can be summed up in two or three weeks worth of class. Furthermore; lady, this is a 100 level course not an MBA course. She has unrealistic expectations of her students and doesn't know when to say when with homework assignments. BEWARE!!! AVOID HER LIKE THE PLAGUE...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is awful. The entire course could be summed up in only two or three classes. Furthermore; lady it is a 100 level course not a MBA course. Gives a ton of assignments and her expectations are unrealistic. BEWARE!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2008<br>Class Name: COMINTE<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is very annoying. Her assignments are redundant and pretty much just busy work. She grades based off who she likes and doesnt like, as crazy as that sounds its true. I worked on an assignment with someone else, they were basically the same. He got an A, i got a C. if she doesnt like u, you cannot do well in this class. BEWARE</div></div></div></body></html>
