    Dr. Klugman has honestly been one of the best professors i've had at Depaul. Yes attendance is mandatory, but you wont want to miss class. He makes medical ethics much more approachable&amp; comfortable. Communication is key, and as long as you email him, he'll appreciate you much more I believe. Discussions in class are what midtermfinal based off of

    He is a super nice guy and he really cares about what he is teaching you. He opens up the class to interesting discussions. I want him to teach every class I take.

    Prof Klugman is probably the most insightful professor I have had at DePaul. He was very knowledgeable about just about any health related topic and could elaborate in language that was easy for students to follow. Very helpful, approachable and clear. I would highly recommend taking a class with him.

    Great professor! He knew his stuff very passionate and made it a lot of fun. A majority of the grade is 2 exams a group project and attendance. Very easy to get A if you show up and pay attention. Highly recommended.

    Interesting class! However, Dr. Klugman isn't very clear about project/papers. There is no text book so it seems like the class is not structured. He is very helpful, just ask if you have any questions. There are very few assignments and the midterm and the final make up most of your grade.
