For an online class is was fun and not too difficult. You have to make 5 podcasts, write 5 papers, and have weekly discussion board posts throughout the quarter. There's no textbook, but you do need a USB microphone. Would take again. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2015<br>Class Name: DC113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a new professor (he graduated from DePaul like a year or two ago).
