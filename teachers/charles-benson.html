Nobody should ever take a course with him. He doesn't use the textbook nor does he speak very clearly. He is extremely old and should not be teaching such a tough course because you can barely understand what he is saying. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TERRIBLE teacher. He pulls up powerpoints that don't make sense. When he does problems on the board, he speaks so quiet and sounds like he is talking to himself. I've had to teach myself everything. Homework questions are nothing like test questions. AVOID AT ALL COSTS IF YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT MATH. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I cannot understand what he is saying. ever. Teach yourself if you want to pass. That's what I'm doing. I believe he is genuinely a very nice man, but he is not the type of teacher one would want to teach them math if you don't know what's going on. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2014<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: D</div><div id="right"><div>he just conducts class from the book's powerpoints which you could do yourself.. there is a lot of hw and quizzes you should keep up with and the tests are very hard.. he is very nice and all but just not engaging or helpful when conducting class. i am quite surprised i passed the class </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2014<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice professor but he does not know how to explain how to do a problem. He stands in front of the class with the back to the students and goes through a powerpoint. He does give us practice problems that we do in class but he still does not know how to really explain how to do a problem. When asking for help, he will take the time to help. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2014<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far, the worst professor I've ever had. He starts class and basically skims the powerpoint and talks to himself. If you're a person who needs to be constantly engaged, your in the wrong place. The T.A. is the one who will be teaching you, not him. I highly encourage you NOT, I REPEAT *DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS*. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>Attendance isn't mandatory, and class is very boring.  All the homework is online on my math lab, so if you're good at teaching yourself then this is the man for you.

I taught myself a lot with the hw, took notes on his example worksheets, and went to class everyday. Additionally, he is awesome when it comes to curving tests. I didn't seek help from him or a tutor and surprisingly passed with an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice professor, but don't take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2013<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor does not care much about his students. Likes to keep back turned on his students as he rewrites the powerpoint slides that he takes from the book.  His teaching is not helpful.. If you want to suceed you will need to get a tutor or teach yourself all of the information based on doing the homework. 2 tests, 1 midterm.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2013<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Benson is a nice guy, but he was often confusing when working out a problem on the board. This class is mostly online (daily homework and quizzes) and it's pretty easy to ace both of those. Tests aren't too hard as long as you are familiar with the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2011<br>Class Name: MTH101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIM!!

He is available at all times and gives you his number so that you can get help over the phone if necessary.Recommend him if your looking to really understand the material</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2010<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree that his teaching lacks clarity. He goes over things a little too fast and often confused himself. BUT he is a very nice man and as long as you do the hw you will pass the class with a B. I failed my in class quizzes and somehow passed it with a B. He's boring but not hard to get a passing grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2010<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's an awful professor. he reads crap outta the book. he writes it on the board. i could teach better math than he can. he's a prick when it comes to missing class, even if you do have a doctors note. if the note isn't to his standards he will not listen to anything you have to say. DO NOT take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2009<br>Class Name: MATH101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Benson was a very nice old man. He tried to be helpful when he saw a student struggling, however he wasn't that clear. He is boring! He lectures all the time and does no hands on work. Instead of letting students do problems on the board, we had to watch him work them out for an hour an a half. He does try to get some computer lab time in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2009<br>Class Name: MATH105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Benson was a nice teacher...He is terrible with teaching and will give you a bad grade no matter how much you attend class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVED HIM!!!

He isn't very helpful but nice enough to talk to. I struggled the whole ten weeks and still don't know college algebra. He isn't really interested if his students understand the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst class ever. He's a nice guy, but seriously can't teach. Every single student complained. The best score from the first midterm was like a C. If you like teaching yourself math, this is definately the class for you. otherwise, better spend your tuition money on something worth while.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>class almost pointless to attend, except that every day you must take a quiz and these quizzes cannot be made up later, so missing class hurts your grade.  he is not good at teaching students, simply does problems out of the book.  often confuses himself and erases, its sad. helpful outside of class, however. wouldnt reccommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2008<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very nice teacher, but shouldn't be teaching. Saying come on guys be nice when you're spending thousands of dollars on education is ludicrous. If you want to teach yourself(Which I ended up doing), take his class. It's very simple: Some are meant to teach, and some aren't.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2008<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had a lot of bad teachers over the years, but prof Benson is easily the worst. Biggest waste of tuition money ever.  Under no circumstances should anyone take his class, avoid at all costs, unless of course you love to take tests that have nothing to do with the material he &quot;taught&quot; and love to spend countless hours studying what wont be teste</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like teaching youself that is what your going to do in this class.

I took him last quarter and yes, he does get confusing but he's a really sweet man and if you ask him for help he's totally willing to help you out.  He's also hilarious.  Some of his comments were just hysterical.  I'm not good at math, but I still managed a B in his class.
