Lots of assignments but they're all  easy. Midterm and final are online. Never did the textbook readings but the test questions are straight from there, so the book is mandatory. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2014<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Erin is one of the highest quality instructors, She's so smart and you can tell is really passionate about her field. She was helpful. Definitely would recommend her to anyone</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this course during the Fall. It was a small, morning class. The professor did a good job of using lecture, videos and discussion to stimulate involvement from the small group. Both exams were take-home, online exams. If you keep up with the readings, then you'll be well-prepared. We had to do an evidence-based presentation. It was fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2013<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class over December intersession. I really enjoyed the class and think it is great for an intersession class. It is essentially one business simulation. Expect to have to do some work before/after the long 9-4 class. It is tiring, but it goes by really fast. I would highly recommend it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2013<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Very organized, easy to follow, easy grader if you put work in. Midterm/final rely heavily on book. Other items are written short essays and a 10 page paper. Topics are not difficult to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class. she is extremely organized and very knowledgeable on the subject of behavioral management. Be ready for tons of reading, assignments and classroom discussions. Exams and assignments are graded fairly, just need to show her that you understand the subject and always back it up with examples. Smart lady, appreciates hard work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2012<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor and great usage of real life examples.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2012<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lot of work, but graded very easily</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2012<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Online course.  She's extremely organized and offered a very interesting variety of resources including TED, podcasts, and cases.  My only complaint is that it is a TON of work- papers are graded more so on meeting a page # requirement than content. Same for quizes-I applied what I learned but missed points b/c I didn't copy/paste answers from text</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2011<br>Class Name: MGT535<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We had some issues getting our textbook for the class so the textbook was dropped. However, there were numerous other readings that were integrated into the course. I felt the professor provided useful readings that she integrated well into the class. She cultured a wonderful discussion based classroom environment. I highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2011<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is difficult...bottomline.  The entire thing is running a business with your group. Prof was nice and helpful but she did reveal our company's secrets to the class during the simulation (the point is to beat the other groups). READ because she does pop quizzes. Dont think you can get away with not reading...you can't.</div></div></div></body></html>
