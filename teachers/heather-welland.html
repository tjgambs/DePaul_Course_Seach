She's so cute, and as long as you take good notes and study for her tests you'll do fine in the class. She's super clear about what you need to know, and if you show that you're interested in class she'll notice. She graded me generously because I always tried to engage in the class conversations, and I think it helped my grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2011<br>Class Name: HIST1001<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her while she was teaching a class at SXU. She was insanely helpful and helped make my classes interesting by integrating videos into the class. The work is easy and clear if you just do it. One of my absolute favorite teachers.</div></div></div></body></html>
