Demands that you participate in class, yet eager to shoot students down. At some point you are hesitant to even say anything.One of the most difficult,dry, and serious classes Ive ever taken.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2009<br>Class Name: REL227<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG! We wrote three papers: 10, 8, 5,pages in length, Gave a speech, wrote an extra credit paper, spent almost all of quarter on the topic of justice and undocumented citizens of the U.S..If you want to be a lawyer take this class, otherwise AVOID it!...Prof. Mousin is an attorney,writer/editor, and a reverend. Very picky when grading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2009<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I regret taking this required class and wish I had read the previous review first,which is true. This class is more like an Advanced English Composition combined with Law. Most if not all classmates felt the same sinking feeling. Good Luck</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Way too hard if you take it as a gen ed.  Really interesting discussions but the one book was unbearable.  Smart, nice guy but expected way too much especially given that is was a night class in the Loop so most of us were full time working students.</div></div></div></body></html>
