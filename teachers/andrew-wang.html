Honestly, I didn't learn anything in this course and got a high grade (mostly because I showed up all lectures - which didn't increased anything on my knowledge - and studied from youtube videos before exams).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is not as bad as they made him sound like, IT 263 was not easy but not the worst. he is one of the most helpful teacher u will run to. he will guide you and try to help you as much as possible.  i will mention it again it s not an easy class unless you either have a networking background or be ready to spend some time with the material. GL All</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2014<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor. Avoid at all costs. His English is poor and very difficult to understand sometimes. If he's not reading directly from slides (basically copied from the cisco netacad site), he's rambling on unintelligibly. Even the network lab assistants say he's a bad teacher. He's also very stubborn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2014<br>Class Name: TDC362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Take with another professor if possible, if you have to take it with him, just be ready for a weird ride.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If given another option, take a different teacher unless you have a background in networking. Otherwise, expect to be confused 90% of the time. However, if you go to all his classes, complete all his labs, and ask questions he will give you at least a B. Super nice guy, just can't teach to beginner students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2014<br>Class Name: TDC362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid if you can.Worst professor at CDM easily.Becomes totally lost when asked for help in class,can only read off his powerpoint.Has blown off myself and several classmates when asked for help outside of class,then lies about ever agreeing to meet in the first place. Many times in class people will literally LOL at his attempt to explain concepts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2013<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really not as bad as other raters make him out to be.  He will expect you to have some knowledge of networking prior to his class so I can see non-IT or new students being intimidated.  If you know a bit already he does a great job covering just enough material to get you by.  Straight to the point and simple final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2013<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice person, but easily the worst professor I have ever had. Can't explain anything thoroughly, and confuses himself a lot when he goes in depth talking about things. Don't take this class unless you're already familiar with networking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: TDC362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor at CDM. Reads word for word from slides. Doesn't know how to explain or teach any problems in class (on rare occasions he covers the in depth material). Slides are taken directly from book (no added insight/explanations). Strong language barrier. Avoid taking at all costs; wait for another professor to teach the class if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: TDC362<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst professor I've ever had. Reads from slides, assigns way to much homework and expects students to learn complex technical formulas and concepts own their own. Final literally every question we ever did and most of the class didn't even finish more than 75% of the test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2010<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Look for another professor , if you are planning to learn by your self then this class will be ok.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2010<br>Class Name: TDC425<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>High accent ,doesnt prepare for the class,reads the slides and for all questions gives mant answers and finally says he confuses and doesn't clarify properly.Gives tomuch assignments takes toomuch time to comple and same with mid term and final with too many questions and each question will have many more questions. Good subject but wrong professor</div></div></div></body></html>
