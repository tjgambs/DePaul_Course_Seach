    Navia is really nice and wants everyone to do well. He was teaching the class I took for the first time and was pretty disorganized, but in the end it was pretty successful. I do think he speaks too much English for an upper level Spanish course. Love him as a person, so-so as a teacher, but I would definitely give him another shot :)

    Very chill. I think his accent is Chilean. Teaches so you understand the basics. Test after every chapter, comps, and orals. some HW too. Class is fun because he is interesting.

    Awesome teacher. I've always wondered why my Spanish teachers didn't explain difficult concepts to the rest of the class in the most simple, comprehensible, and useful way possible. He does this. Highly recommended.

    Really good professor.  He really wants his students to do well and he was always willing to help and made himself really available.  He made test review sheets even though he wasn't supposed to.  He has an accent, but it's not bad at all he's lived here for like 25 years or something.  4 quizzes, 2 compositions, 1 oral 'exam'. Take him if you can.

    This guy is really incredible. He grew up in Chile under Pinochet, if that means anything to you, and he's always got something interesting to say each class. He's not a very tough grader, and there isn't a single D or F that you can't talk your way up to a C. He's nice, and pretty funny. Take him if you have the opportunity.

    Profe Navia is probably my favorite teacher that I have ever had at DePaul.  He is very insightful and really piques your interest in the subject. He will make a point to talk to every student personally to find out their opinions and progress on the course. If anything, take him cause he's definitely easy on the eyes :)

    Can't go wrong with Bernardo.  He's nice, he's helpful, he's funny, he'll cut you serious grading slack just because he likes you.  As if that weren't enough, he's a good, engaging teacher and he knows his****.  Definitely take him for ALL 100-level Spanish if you possibly can - you'll learn what you need to and have fun doing it.

    Bernardo is a wonderful teacher and a great guy. He is genuinely interested in what his students have to say and treats them like adults. The most difficult part of his class is that he doesn't spoon feed you the information. You practice the material in class, but usually I had to learn it outside of class.

    Bernardo takes the spanish language and transforms speaking into an art form. He spent entire classes discussing politics, war, love, faith, and dreams. He is the kind of professor you won't forget.

    He's good at sharing experiences and teaching you about culture. He is not, however, the best at teaching grammar. I recommend taking the class for the experience and having a tutor or taking the time to read the book to help you with grammar if you're not already good at it. If If you don't understand, ask. He happily answers.

    He has some good stories and insights, which add much to one's cultural understanding, but when it comes to explaining some points, like the verbs, he is not clear.  He jumps around a lot and does not emphasize the grammatical points enough.  His love of his subject is clear and he enjoys teaching

    I love this guy! He makes a boring Spanish class bearable, with his hilarious stories. You will learn, despite the fact that the workload is easy. He's a native speaker, so your pronunciation will improve just from listening to him. If you're taking intermediate spanish, make sure it's with him!

    Navia has a professional way of working. If you are not doing good in his class it's because your not working hard as you should be as a  student not b/c of your gender. He is the type who will go out of his way to help you and he's highly trained for what he is doing. To prove this I am a male and I got A's in all 3 spn classes I took with him.

    Bernardo is an awsome teacher, he is a really nice guy and will try and help you understand things, the only problem is that he is not always so clear on things and somtimes things will be on the test that we never talked about.  Really nice guy tho.

    Bernardo is a really great teacher. He makes sure that the whole class understands the importance of an issue and is very open to student's views. He is one of the most humble persons that I have ever meet.

    Bernado is awesome.  As a teacher, he's average, but what he lacks in ability he makes up for in sheer enjoyability of the class.
