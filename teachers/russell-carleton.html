    If you go to class and pay attention and take notes you will be perfect. Tests are with a cheat sheet and will only have questions that are similar to homework problems which are due once a week. Always willing to help and explain anything if asked. Also more than willing to meet with students to discuss anything. Great teacher!

    Nice guy and class is pretty easy, but his jokes get old very fast and eventually you will want to shoot yourself.  Class would have been great had he realized he is a psych prof and not a comedian.

    Easy teacher, but I don't know why everyone has said he's funny. His jokes are probably cheesier than my grandpa's. But he knows his stuff, and he's really approachable.

    Dedicated, fair, enthusiastic and usually entertaining.  Lectures are comprehensive and essay tests are easy to prepare for and do well one.  Very willing to help however possible.  Also, talks about his wife all the time... so cute.

    Funny, energetic, and all around a good teacher.  Always open to questions and available to help out.  The class is actually quite a bit easier than I expected.  The only part that blows is the 5 hours of experiments you have to be a guinea pig for, but that's department policy, not his.

    easy to pass, but horrible to sit through. i think he practiced in front of a mirror to make sure he went from 6-9:15 every single night with only 1 15 minute break.  annoying and boring...do not take him

    He was enthusiastic and easy. We had two papers (3 pages doubble spaced each), a midterm and a final. For both tests he gave us the questions ahead of time.  It was easy to get a good grade.  However, if you're looking to actually learn something, I doubt this is the class for you.  Most time is spent reviewing basic psychology terms and info.

    He is the best teacher I have ever had. I looked forward to getting up at 630AM in order to drive in rush hour traffic to his class. He does require effort to get a good grade and he might not be the easiest grader, but you will learn so much. Very energetic...keeps you interested!

    Anyone who has ever worried about taking a stats class, take him!  He explains homework assingments very well.  If you do well on the homework and come to class on a regular basis, there is no reason why one cannot be highly successful. Grading is fair.  Tests are fair. Minimal in class assingments (not hard).  I would definitely take him again!
