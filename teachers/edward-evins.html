Don't skip class because there is always something due. If you skip more than twice, you automatically fail. He is very nice and helpful. I  always went up to him after class just so he could look over my essay and check if it was okay. I will totally recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Evins has an incredibly huge attitude. Not to mention his refusal to listen to his students' comments and give them helpful feedback. I feel as if his WRD 104 class was more of a journalism class, since everything revolved around the NYT and analyzing various pieces of work. Would not suggest taking his class.  Anyone else is better. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>While I love this class, Evins is hands down the sassiest professor at DePaul. If you text in class? You'll receive a passive aggressive request to leave. Come to his meetings unprepared? You'll receieve a sassy remark to leave. While I enjoy having the NYT as a textbook, you really don't have to buy it. But you can't come to class without it. So..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Show up, do the work, and work hard, and you'll do good</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives good feedback. You can care less about grades because you sign a contract for a B at the start, and provided you keep to it, you will be fine. To get an A, you just have to be excellent. Expect to enjoy mouth watering doughnuts for free. He is a free-spirited and kind professor. Don't give him the unpleasant task of walking you out. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>He is an amazing teacher. He has this "contract for a B" he makes you sign on the first day and to get an A you actually have to try. You wont get bored in his class and he is enthusiastic. He will help you when you ask and does not give grades on papers, only feedback. If you follow contract for B, you will be fine. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you come ready to learn and prepared you have nothing to worry about. This professor has a deep passion for the subject he is teaching which makes it easier to get interested. Overall a great experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Started off very professional and curtious; ended on a bad note, becoming one of the sassiest teachers I have ever met.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST WRD prof depaul has. He is extremely helpful and reachable 24/7 via email. He is very clear in his assignments and expectations. If you show up to class every day and turn all the assignments in on time AND PARTICIPATE in class you'll get an A. Overall, Evins is an amazing and thought-provoking prof. Take his class if you get a chance!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool professor. We read the NYT Sunday edition every week (lots of reading, if you actually do it. no one did). More than 2 absences and you automatically get a C in the class. Office hours are good & he's very hands-on with everyone's work. A lot of group work which sucks</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Evins was really cool. As long as you show up, keep up with the work and occasionally talk in class, you will do fine. He is very helpful if something is not clear and really wants to help. He does talk a lot and has some funny mannerisms but other than that, he is great and really nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not boring at all and is fairly fun, at least for a professor. He assigns work just about every night so there's lots of writing. Still don't quite understand his grading scale but just show up and do everything and you'll get a B, even if you do it badly. I managed to pull out an A and I feel like I'm bad at writing, maybe that's a good sign.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome guy, love his energy in teaching, keeps things interesting. Lots of writing in the class. He has an interesting grading method, but it's not hard to get a good grade. If you attend class and do all minimum requirements, you're sure to get a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is a lot of work.  Guaranteed a B if you show up to every class and turn in everything on time, but there is a lot of writing every single night, hard to keep up with all classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Evins is a good guy and really makes class enjoyable, but completely overestimates the workload of a 100 level writing class.  Assigns too much daily writing and papers due friday nights.  Does not allow the student to work at their own pace and gives work as though you don't have any other classes to do work for</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best proffesor yet. passionate about what he teachers, very hyper and energetic. class is never dull. he is engaging. the work load is acceptable. alot of short papers before class every day to go along with reading and 4 essays. not an easy A but show up (mandatory) do your work or you get kicked out, & participate. if u do that no less than a B-</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A with a fun, helpful teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome guy! He's so nice and approachable, not to mention funny! He requires you to meet w him for every paper but it's not a huge deal and the comments he gives you are extremely helpful!! Class time was used well, lots of in class group work and discussion. The readings were a bit boring and long. But overall take him you won't</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Greatest writing instructor I've ever had.  I've always HATED writing and, while I don't particularly enjoy it now, I've gotten better at it.  He is willing to meet with students to help them on their papers and he will make you a better writer if you are willing to put in the effort.  be prepared for a lot of writing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, excellent professor and very helpful. Just the workload is completely unnecessary for a WRD class.

This professor is always willing to help you out anyway he can and he does it because he cares.

For every major assignment he will meet with everyone individually and personally comment on your essays, so you can improve them.  He's kind of a tough grader in terms of papers but if you do well on the midterm and final portfolios you'll be fine! I definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2010<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I always hated writing and after taking his class writing has become one of my favorite subjects. He is funny, easy going, but his grading is a little tough. His mid-term and final portfolio make up your grade so do not slack.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's great.

Alot of bs assignments that do not affect your grade. Go to class and try really hard on your midterm and final. Still do-able not as easy as he looks intially</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2010<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so great! I felt that my writing did improve. He can tell you exactly what you need to improve.  4-5 short essays and some reading assignments, but it is managable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!

Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great teacher, He's very helpful and easy going.
