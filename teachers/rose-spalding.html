Participation is key, so have a good understanding of the readings and you'll be solid. She has no set office hours, but she's very willing to help. Short papers throughout the quarter and a research paper due at the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Spalding is very knowledgeable but her lectures are very dry. The books that she had us read were interesting but she is not very good at explaining them. There were a few presentations and days that had group work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2011<br>Class Name: PSC244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a brilliant professor. Yeah she is tough but so what I went to college to be challenged  and it is not like she won't help anyone if they ask for it. Lots of reading and tough midterm and finals but if you really want to learn about Latin America she is the professor you are looking for.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She admits some of the reading is difficult to comprehend but gives great feedback and notes for all the reading assigned. She is extremely knowledgeable and very helpful out of class to help you with whatever trouble you are having. Gives great feedback if you hand a paper in early for review. I would recommend her without a doubt.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2010<br>Class Name: PSC244<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very hard grader, the material is interesting and she knows a lot, very nice woman and helpful after class but I feel like she is talking to herself and not to a classroom, very hard to pay attention to and boring.. needed to teach myself most of the material</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2010<br>Class Name: PSC244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor, teaches the class really well. Tough grader when it comes to midterms and finals. Overall good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2008<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If your a poli sci major, or are interested in politics/ economics take her! She isnt an easy professor and grades pretty tough. However I feel like I learned a lot in her class! I would def take another course with her. If your are having a hard time she is ALWAYS willing to help. Also she is tolerant if you need extra time for an assignment.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2008<br>Class Name: PSC282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her Fair Trade class in Fall and every class we did something different--role playing, presentations, analyzing websites and organizations.  Working at the farmers market was a lot of fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2008<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You've got your A if you can write a paper that she agrees with. Otherwise, watch out. Her lectures were full of rambling ideas that didn't make sense a lot of the time. She really encourages participation, but it's hard to participate when she's domineering the conversation. I would recommend taking someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2007<br>Class Name: PSC344<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great! Some readings were hard but she explained things well. The course was on globalization and we got to do research on any international topic we wanted. Smart and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the best professor I have encountered so far at DePaul. The material is not easy, but she is dedicated to bringing students to a better understanding of it. This woman is smart, punctual, diplomatic, sympathetic, personable, and best of all: She knows her stuff, and wants to share it with students. Absolutely outstanding class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2007<br>Class Name: PSC359<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was also in that dec. session. 30-45 minutes&#63; Wow, my watch must've been slow... Brilliant woman, appropriate workload for a class (unless you assume that a dec session should be a freebie)boring if you dont like to learn I suppose. Knows her stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2007<br>Class Name: PSC252<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very approachable, friendly prof. Insanely knowledgeable. If Latin America is an area of interest, absolutely take her, it is worth it. If not, she's a difficult grader and lectures are kinda dry and usually take up the whole class period. Gotta respect her though, the lady travels all over L.A. (got invited to Nicaraguan elections), she's a badass</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2006<br>Class Name: PSC359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talks forever and shes boring.  The class only met 10 times for 3 hours four days a week (wint inter) not once did we get out on time.  She talked so much we got out 30 minutes to 45 minutes late every session.  Grading system not clear. work load is rediculous I asked for help made corrections and she graded me lower. I should have an A got a C+.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2006<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dread coming to her class every time. I do admit that she is very knowledgeable and a nice person, but she is just not interesting, not even one bit. She is also a difficult grader. I cannot wait until this quarter is over.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2006<br>Class Name: PSC234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a great professor...for those who found her boring, I believe you are not at her level. She knows all about LA, great person and teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: PSC359<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Spaulding's ratings here fit her perfectly.  Extremely nice, but extremely difficult.  I admit it probably would be difficult to find the class interesting if you are a moron.  I would also think that it would be quite &quot;boring&quot; if I was getting bad grades.  People here are just upset that they were finally held accountable in college.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: PSC359<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice as an individual, but needs to retire. Extremely boring, one of the worst classes ever. Do yourself a favor and take someone interesting!!! Materials were dull, and overall the class was horrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: LATINAMERICAN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very very nice person.  wealth of information given in her lectures.  Doesn't allow a lot of discussion which can be tiring.  I highly recommend any of her classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: LAPOLITICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  This was my second class with her and I only have good things to say (although, she is a tough grader).  She rarely uses notes and can just ramble off ideas and topics for hours.  She is obviously liberal, but she is so professional that it will never show the whole quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2005<br>Class Name: PSC252<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice teacher; can be boring because she mostly lectures but she is brilliant.  If you want to learn, she'll teach you.  Can be a tough grader but class does not involve a huge amount of reading/writing.  Great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: PSC244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS AWESOME, WONT BE AT DEPAUL IN THE SPRING. VERY HARD BUT REALLY PUSHES YOU TO ANALYZE AND THINK</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really interesting and very nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2004<br>Class Name: LAUSRELAT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely bright prof.  Can lecture all day from the top of her head.  She is liberal, but it does not come out in in the class. How refreshing.  She is a rather tough grader, but if you put forth effort I would think it near impossible to get less than a C.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2004<br>Class Name: LATINAM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely difficult but extremely nice and she does not force her political view onto her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2004<br>Class Name: FOCALPT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Like everyone else said, she is an extremely tough grader; be ready to work really hard. she is very nice and approachable & soft spoken. knows her stuff & you learn a lot. if ur looking for a blow off class, do not take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2004<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brilliant woman yet humble. She is very helpful and most importantly teaches you to be critical and analytical. She is very challenging, but it works to your advantage if you are really interested in the material. You'll do well if you put work hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2004<br>Class Name: ESP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yea.. I'm doing my final right now and I'm looking back at the class as a whole.  I couldn't stand this class.  Shes the toughest grader I've run into at DePaul.  She really seems to play favorites as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty good professor.  The class discussions were interesting, although sometimes it gets boring.  She's a very tough grader, so if you want a good grade you better work for it.  Lots of reading.  Nice lady.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of reading, shes a really hard grader, but she defenetly knows a lot about Cuba.  Spends the whole class talking.
