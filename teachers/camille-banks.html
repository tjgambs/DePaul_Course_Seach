    I took her WRD 103 and if you do what she asks you'll be good.  Give her a copy of your paper and she'll edit for you, go to the writing center.  Learned a lot and one of my favorite professors, really helped improve my writng!  Also very clear and concise in what she wants and talk to her about your paper and it will HELP!

    Overall, just not a good teacher. Terrible personality, disorienting criticism, absolutely unapproachable...really all the bad things you could find in a professor.

    One minute shes snarky and mean, and the next shes as nice as can be. Hard to read as a person. She grades rather unreasonably, giving low grades on papers with very few marks on what you did wrong, just broad statements. She has very inflexible hours just because she doesn't want to come down to Lincoln Park. Overall, I'd try to avoid her.

    She's okay...I'm surprised that this is the first review of her.
