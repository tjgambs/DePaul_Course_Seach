He is a good political science professor and he will definitely teach you a lot. He assigns a lot of readings and gives pop-quizzes that can be a little rough. Make sure you participate in class and take advantage of his office hours. It'll help you, if he knows who you are! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2015<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Stalley was amazing and wanted us to have conversations that weren't just about political science. THE FINAL IS OPTIONAL and the biggest part of your grade is a final paper but he makes you write most of for a rough draft. All around amazing professor who wants to see his students succeed. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2015<br>Class Name: 349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor, awesome class.  I didn't know much about the environment before the class but learned alot.  Lots of discussions debates. There is one big research paper, but he gives you help and he's easy to talk to. Funny guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2014<br>Class Name: PSC359<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For online class, this course was impressively engaging. This class was really interesting and you will learn a lot from it. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Basically  a soul destroying class if your not an economics major.  Worst decision of my life.  You'll literally work for weeks on a paper and get it back with the most ridiculous comments and grade. He doesn't acknowledge that some people aren't econ majors and that this is a class you're being forced to take</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2014<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. If you stay on track for the final paper its nearly impossible to bad on it. Go to office hours if you need extra help, he is a funny friendly guy. I would definitely take a course again with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2013<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Very intelligent man but very confusing professor. Too many small details/ requirements in order to secure a good grade. He covered many important topics but had a lot of nit-picky quirks that made the class frustrating at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2013<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor. There's a ton of reading everyday but he discusses the main points in class. His power points are clear and helpful. Discussions in class keep it interesting. 8 page final paper as well as a final exam but they're not too bad if you study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: PSC359<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to take a class where not a minute of your time is wasted, take Professor Stalley! He is always extremely prepared for lectures, and takes ample time for class participation. His passion for everything China is clear, and makes it much easier to stay engaged. High reading requirement outside of class, and attendance is mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2013<br>Class Name: PSC359<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't recommend Stalley to anyone--he is very knowledgeable, but his classroom felt more like a high school lecture. I've had classes with 75% of the political science staff at DePaul. With that being said, he is, in my opinion, among the worst. The one and only redeeming quality was his sense of humor, but I'm not paying for entertainment.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2013<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stalley is really nice, cool, and funny. However, there is much reading + reading notes. Say goodbye to your hand cause all these notes will kill ya. The 8 page paper is not too scary b/c he lets you pick ANY topic in politics. I recommend u take this class, but be prepared to be flooded with emails from this guy. sends emails like each other day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2013<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was pretty easy, just A LOT of reading. One long research paper, a midterm, and a final are basically the only grades for the quarter, so if you screw up on any one of them you're screwed. But hes a very nice guy and tries to make the class interesting, unfortunately it was not.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2013<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Stalley's Intro to International Relations does not feel like an introduction course. If you like rigorous reading schedules, take home final exams and don't have a job, then this is your guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2012<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You learn a lot in this class if you put in the work. Completing the assigned reading is necessary if you want to perform well on the exams. Stalley is more than willing to help and wants his students to take a lot away from his class. He keeps the information relevant and works to make it interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2012<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's legit. The class was almost all girls I think for a reason. Stalley's cute and can teach too!  A fair amount of reading about capitalism, but not too hard if you keep up plus he goes over it.  He's very enthusiastic and encourages participation.  Really wants students to debate about globalization. You'll learn a lot if you do the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2012<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is definately not for slackers, but you learn a ton. Lots of reading, but he mixes up class format so it's not just lecture.  Uses power point, but doesn't just stand there and read it.  He's actually a pretty funny guy. smart, but not intimmidating at all.  Just keep up and your fine.  If you want to learn, take Stalley!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2012<br>Class Name: PSC246<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's a 246 level but he gives so much reading and his exams are so hard that it seems like a senior capstone. His lectures are really boring and when you go to him for help he tries but doesn't actual help. And to "help" you study he simply says study everything and study hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: PSC359<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He isn't a tough professor, you just need to make effort. He is very helpful and it is clear he cares about his students. Participate in class, he appreciates that. Tests are doable, just make sure to study! I only did half the readings, and I did well in the class. Class consists of power point presentations, which at times got extremely boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You do everything on Excel. Every.Single.Assignment. On a PC. In the computer lab everyday where he gives Powerpoint slides for notes. A midterm and exam that are not terrible, but make sure you study. Boatload of assignments, working individual and group work. On top of the final exam, there is a time-consuming final group project. Don't slack off</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2011<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super Hard Grader, who treated the class like it was a 300 level course instead of a 100 level. SOOOOOO MUCH READING!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2011<br>Class Name: PSC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Great Class. Would recommend it to all PSC majors or China history buffs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2010<br>Class Name: PSC369<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor who cares about his students.  A lot of readings, but all are interesting and related to the class.  Grade is a combination of Iclicker questions, midterm, and final paper.  As long as you put in the effort, you should do well in the class.  Just don't be overwhelmed by all the readings.  Overall, an interesting, rewarding class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2009<br>Class Name: PSC246<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor, He loves teaching and you can tell. his lectures engage the class with discussions. Expect some difficult research papers as well as mid-term and final exams. He is a hard grader but a very good teacher. You will definitely learn something in this class. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stalley's the man.  He facilitates extremely engaging discussion and you can tell he puts a lot of effort into teaching his classes.  Take him if you get a chance; beyond that, get to know him outside of class.  He's a great guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stalley totally rocks. He seems like a serious, economics-minded man and I was worried that it would be very difficult to earn a good grade in the class. As the quarter went on, we realized how funny and smart he is, and it was obvious that he enjoyed teaching this material-- definitely open-minded and allowed flexible changes. Not very hard grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2008<br>Class Name: PSC359<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Guy- very good teacher. However, he is a hard grader and gives hard tests. But he is worth taking. Makes class fun w/ I- clicker, good lectures; expect intense research paper AND hard Mid & Final exams. Ya, it seems like a lot of work- But I would definitely take him again! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2008<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stalley is one of the best professors in the Political Science department. I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: SOC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Stalley is incredibly smart, approachable and accessible. Classes are very challenging and you will learn a lot. I had him every quarter this year and he was great every time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2008<br>Class Name: PSC359<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher i had him for comparative chinese politics and in that class there was alot of reading, tests pretty hard but i pulled through, i'm taking him again right now as we speak</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2008<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A real nice guy who helps you out a lot.  The classes are just notes which get kind of boring but he makes it somewhat interesting.  You don't really have ot read but I would recommend doing so.  Good class, would take him again</div></div></div></body></html>
