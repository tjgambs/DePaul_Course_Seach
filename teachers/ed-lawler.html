Everyone says he is easy, but I dont think so. Maybe he just disliked me because my attendance wasn't that great (He LOVES to track attendance and mark you off severely for it). My interviewee bailed on me and left me with no paper... he didn't care. Lost major points. Sucked.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: CMN396<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ed's a good guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: ADVISOR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really helpfull and friendly advisor.
