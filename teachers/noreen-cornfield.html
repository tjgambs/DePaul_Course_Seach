    Seems sweet, nice, and caring... but it's all a facade.  She is useless.  She is so strict and lives exactly by her rules with NO leniency or exceptions.  CANNOT MISS MORE THAN HALF OF ONE CLASS!  This **** is crazy.  BORING LECTURES (prob the reason for her attendance policy), and reads right out of the book.  Little class discussions- DON'T TAKE

    Extremely sweet woman, endearing in fact, yet a poor teacher.  She seems genuinely passionate about the subject matter, but fails to bring new conversation to class.  All of her assigned projects were fascinating,but that's when I learned the most--from other student's work.  Her lectures were monotonous. STRICT attendance policy!

    Noreen is a poor teacher. She is very soft spoken and seems tired when she speaks. She does not cover anything new in lectures that was not talked about in the readings. She wasted 4 classes showing us the musical &quot;rent&quot; which was an enormous waste of time. The book &quot;neo-bohemia&quot; was interesting, but Noreen killed it with her monotonous lectures.

    Wonderful professor. Loves class discussions. Extremely sweet and cares about her students' well-being, not just their classwork.

    Dr. Cornfield is my advisor, but I feel that she really needed to retire a long time ago because she's losing her touch in the way she teaches. Her exams are sometimes not clear in the way a student would understand.Her skill as an advisor needs work and students have dropped her class the first wee

    I skipped the into to soc classes so i could take her ASAP. She is awsome and very knowlegable. She expects a lot out of you but you can get good grades if you work hard and are nice to her. She is organized and prepared. Take her if you can.
