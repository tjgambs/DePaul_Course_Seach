He really knows his stuff (he's an Assistant State's Attorney during the day) so his lectures are very clear and easy to understand. Participation definitely matters but if you put in an average amount of effort and attend class regularly there's really no way you shouldn't get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2014<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher, he takes pride in what he does!

Definitely is hands on which is how it should be. He's extremely personable, intelligent and can take a joke. The courses he teaches are phenomenal in a sense that YOU ACTUALLY RETAIN INFORMATION. He presents topics and information in clarity. Don't take this guy as a joke either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Danny is the coolest, his class is so laid back it makes you want to go. He has a lot of connections so he is always bringing in awesome speakers. I had him for Discover: Justice in the City and the excursions we went on were easily some of the coolest things I've ever done. I definitely recommend taking one of his classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2013<br>Class Name: HOT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Danny is BOMB-DIGGITy.

This was by far the best academic experience I have ever had.  Danny is an amazing instructor/attorney who can relate to the students while teaching us a plethora of information.  I will continue taking his courses throughout my time at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Danny was an awesome teacher!
