Professor Rosey is one of the best chemistry teachers I have had this year. He answers questions and asks the class how they feel about a topic before moving on. He cares about students and is a fair grader. He's also nice and jokes around a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2012<br>Class Name: CHEM100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very excellent professor that cares a lot about his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2012<br>Class Name: CHEM3<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's awesome. He gets really really and i mean REALLY boring at times. But the thing is he cares ab students. He's the proffesor that knows every single student by their first name in class. He's also very clear and always willing to help I've e mailed him at 3AM and he answered me. Great guy take him! class is hard but ey, its chem. He also curves</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2012<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the greatest lab professor but he is pretty cool.

Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2012<br>Class Name: CHEM134<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His Lectures are TERRIBLE! but still attend because he drops hints about exams and explains everything step by step(which can be annoying but can save grades). Do the book problems and your golden.Hint: email him questions you have because he WILL NOT answer them in class. However, I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: CHM135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really easy going and exams are pretty easy as long as you study the night before. Can't complain, it was pretty easy. Just put in work the night before and you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: CHE135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy. Only problem is unclear at times so parts of tests can catch you off guard, but it's his first year and I see him improving a lot. Also, he posts all his lectures online and puts up a lot of helpful study materials online. Puts a lot of learning on you, but hey, it's college</div></div></div></body></html>
