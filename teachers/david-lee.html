    Messy assignments. Overall more interested in trying to win a laugh rather than explain the material. Very generic homework assignments and exams with answers often open to interpretation rather than based on things learned in the class. Would not recommend

    Very detail, passionate about the topic and gives real life examples. I don't feel there was enough material for 10 week course.

    He is a good teacher, prepared and knows about what he is speaking. To clarify things he often uses real examples what helps a lot. Only the grading is sometimes too hard but it is still fair.
