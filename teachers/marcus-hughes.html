    This class was supposed to be about Immigrants and Education but that was never spoken of. Marcus usually would expose a "truth" every class and honestly it was great. I always left that class wanting to make a change. It was mostly lecture and just as easy and interesting. He's a great guy and I would love to take him again.

    I remember our first class topic, "What is a mask?". We were taught to remove our invisible mask and accept other people's opinions and views. I learned lessons that I could carry for the rest of my life. I would recommend anyone and everyone to take at least one of his classes. They have changed the way I look at life.

    Marcus is dedicated to teaching his students the truth in a wide variety of subjects (food industry, bias in historical writing, educational movements around the world, subliminal messages).  I always went to class because I didn't want to miss his lectures which more closely resemble discussions in which the voice of each student is valued.

    One of the best professors I have had at DePaul! He tries to give his students all the knowledge he has and also learns from the students as well. I never felt uncomfortable to speak in class and ask questions. I learned about myself as a future educator and as a human being. I hope to bring as much positivity and enjoyment to my classroom!

    Probably the best teacher I have had at DePaul. He is willing to help you with everything. Super understanding, brings out the best in his students especially in group discussions, and he makes you want to be a better person. If i could I would take it again.

    He is a charismatic individual.  Teaches students to think critically and be aware of their surroundings.  He is also pretty funny.  Laid back class with a lot of classroom discussions and presentations.  The class is really what you make out of it.  You can learn a lot or you can just drift on by.

    Great professor! Great guy in general.  He makes the class environment very comfortable and laid back.  Discusses things that are happening NOW - things students want to really hear about.  It made us all want to go to class.  He's always there for additional help or if you need support or just someone to chat with.  Few assignments. Easy. Fun.

    Trust me, you wouldn't want to miss class he speaks the truths and you have to be open minded to his outlook on the world. If money wasn't tight I would be more than happy to take all the classes he offers. Very funny individual and will have a high impact on your way of thinking. You won't regret taking this class.

    Professor Hughes is not only a great professor, but an even better human being with a unique outlook on the world. Values ideas over intelligence.  One of the few classes I have ever looked forward to attending.  His worldview is radical but inspiring. His personal transparency created an open and accepting environment.  Take his class.

    I have never been in a class where students felt more comfortable to discuss their opinions. Prof Hughes allows students to learn a lot from him and even more from their peers. His class may seem easy, but he challenges you to think critically in ways you have not done before and about things you would not normally think about. Great man and Prof.

    Prof Hughes's class was always very interesting and engaging.  He would present information to the class (regarding issues from education to the food industry to perceptions of youth) and facilitate a class discussion.  He is very passionate about sharing knowledge to empower students.  Never wanted to miss class.

    Dr. Hughes or simply Marcus as he did not like the titles much. There is much to lean  from Marcus as he is definitely a breath of fresh air. You will get a piece of mind in his class and will come out of the class not only having info about the class but the "GAME" as he referred to. He is the real deal, i highly recommend him for any classes.

    Professor Hughes taught me something you can't just read from a text book. I learned more than I ever could have imagined. He challenges your mind with critical thinking questions, which as a senior in college, I haven't truly been challenged since this class. Professor Hughes is very straight forward and tells it how it is. speaks the truth.

    Dr. Hughes is a very profound professor (in a good way). You will never meet any one like him. Every class we discussed a new controversial topic that forced us to critically think about our self and our society. Take this class if you are serious about becoming a better person!

    He is foremost concerned with how much his students learn, and in my opinion this is the distinguishing quality of an excellent teacher. I learned about what's going on in the world today and how I am affected, not useless stuff I don't care about and will never use. Class discussions were super open and low pressure. Overall really superb teacher.

    Prof. Hughes' class changed my life for the better- I am not kidding! Hughes wants his students to really think and he does an excellent job. He is also incredibly knowledgeable and has great information to share. If more people listened to this man, this world would be a better place! PLEASE take his class- you won' regret it.

    Professor Hughes is AMAZING!!!!! He makes you think and he will most definitely  change your life if you let him. The class is so much fun and so interesting. After every class you will walk away thinking. He is NOT a stickler about grades... he instead wants you to walk out actually learning something. As long as you do the work you will be okay.

    Easily the best professor at DePaul. Made you think. That was his focus the whole time, all that really mattered to him. Created mutual respect and never took anything too seriously. Awesome professor but even more awesome person. Highly compelling and supportive. Made me feel at home in the classroom.  Best professor best class at DPU.

    This Doctor is not just your teacher, if you let him- he will be your Guide. He has opened my eyes, and many students alike, to the Real World. He gives Truth, only .. No BS. If you want to get to know yourself while learning about the country you call Home.. Take his class. If shallow papers and scantrons are what you're looking for- wrong class!

    BEST PROFESSOR EVER - Hands down. He's more of a friend than a teacher. He's much more concerned with hearing what you make of the course material than testing you on it. One of the most interesting men I've ever met. He will genuinely change the way you look at our government and social constructs. A philosophical genius.. TAKE THIS CLASS, DAMMIT!

    Hands down best professor at DePaul. Not only would I leave his class with a new perspective on practically anything pertaining life and our society, I would not stop ranting to friends about the things I learned in class. If you want to take a sophomore seminar that you will LOVE TAKE HIM!! You will not regret it!

    BY FAR the best professor I've had in any level of education yet. This man will change you. He gives out A's (but don't get caught up in that). He makes you think about things in ways that you've never thought about them before. He stimulates conversation and is the kind of teacher that can be your best friend by the end of the quarter. TAKE IT.

    Dear Professor Hughes,   I just received my diploma and I was reminded to thank those who were instrumental in my reaching my goal.

    Dr. Hughes offered light at the end of a dark tunnel.  I appreciate his class and the lessons I learned. I have a better perspective on my own philosophy of education and life. Thanks, Dr. Hughes for making a difference in my educational career and life.

    Dr. Hughes is one of the best professors I have had.  No doubt he is very knowledgeable about the content and exhibits a sincere desire to teach children and improve the educational system.  In both classes i had with him he assigned interesting and engaging readings and facilitated great discussions with the class.  You will enjoy his class!

    I really enjoyed the instructor and he always offers assistance to us (students). He continually wants students to think, in hopes, of being leaders instead of part of the 'human herd.'

    Best teacher I have ever had. I know a philosophy class does not seem that interesting, but trust me, you will really enjoy going to this class.

    The professor assigns work throughout the quarter with various readings and 5 journal entries due based on these readings. There are also a few group presentations (2 on readings and one that involves teaching a lesson plan), one ten page paper, and a take home exam. There is one tardy allowed. If you do your work you can get an A in this class.
