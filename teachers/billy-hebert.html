He may seem like he wants you to work hard for the class just to help you w/ your work ethic but after week 1, it's a ride in the park. Prof is funny-corny at times, you get to listen to music and listen to him serenate you with his piano</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2005<br>Class Name: MUS275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME class! I never would have even thought about taking a class on the symphony but Prof Hebert is amazing. You listen to music most of the time whether its a CD or him on the piano. Definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: MUS101103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The greatest teacher I have EVER had at depaul. So funny and you can really tell that he enjoys teaching. His tests are easy and if a lot of people will do bad he just blames himself and throws them out. I love Billy Hebert and would take all of my classes with him if I could. THE BEST!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2004<br>Class Name: MUS130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>tooooooooooo easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2004<br>Class Name: MUS275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Hebert is one of the funniest teachers I've had yet.  He's a very easy grader and goes over everything before the tests.  Just don't let your phone ring in class...  sometimes he likes to answer them for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2004<br>Class Name: MUS101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Freshman Musicianship teacher...awesome class.  Hilarious guy, mostly lectures - if you take notes you'll get everything you need for the test.  Usually helps answer wkshts in class or if the students approach him, tests are directly from sheets. THE BEST</div></div></div></body></html>
