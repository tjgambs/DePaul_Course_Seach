    Worst prof. ever taken. Advice to students: make the trats worth A LOT and irats little.Also speed through tests-dont take time to dbl check your answers.She lectures once a week, which often consists of her preaching or teaching us about the effectiveness of team based learning. She does not teach bio-you read everything you need to know

    Hands down the best teacher I have ever had at DePaul.  I hated her when I first got to class, I felt like I was back in high school and was uncomfortable with the whole team based learning.  However, after getting used to it, I loved it.  She knows what she is talking about, and is always very energetic, gives off a contagious energy.

    I think LeClair is a great teacher. I've heard awful things about her, but everyone I know personally likes her. I did best with her style of teaching, it helped me stay focused, she is very clear, and super passionate. Her excitement is contagious, and she is very professional. I have no complaints for her. Love her :)

    There are a lot of bad reviews for Leclair, which puzzles me because I think she is a very good teacher.  She is very passionate and keeps you engaged during lecture.  If you go to class (and listen) and read the book a little, you'll do well, providing you have some affinity for biology.

    I loved Leclair. She hardly ever uses powerpoints and makes her lectures sooo interesting. She is funny and really enjoys what she's talking about. Out of all the general bio series teachers she was my FAVORITE.  iClicker reviews make the tests easier. Definitely have to pay attention and attend lecture to do well.she uses a lot of outside material

    Amazing, Amazing teacher. If you're at all interested in material, she'll plunge you into a magical world of biology! She is very interested and knowledgable about what she is taking about, and she always explains everything in a few different ways to make sure everyone really gets it. I am going to take as many of her classes as I can!

    She's the worst teacher I have ever experienced. She makes you feel like your in middle school by making you do grammar worksheets, and also uses a crazy grading system. Getting a 100% on an assignment is nearly impossible.  I have frequently received 1.95/2, etc.  Ridiculous grading system that she cannot justify.  Class and lectures were BORING!

    Dr. LeClair presents the material in a well organized manner and it essential to attend lecture.  She is mainly there to teach and not really there for outside help, that is for the TA.  She has a very low patience level and this can be intimidating to students.

    She should not be teaching. She makes you feel like you are still in middle school and is very rude. She is the only teacher I absolutly despice and I have never met a single person who liked her. I am sure that those comments were left by her.

    She's an extremely busy research scientist with a passion for her work.  If you take her class and she shares her personal medical history with you, you may see why she's no-nonsense and doesn't really like slackers.  She's extremely respectful of everyone in class and encourages discussion/participation.  Come ready to learn or don't come at all.

    One of the best professors at DePaul. Truly understands how to convey the subject matter to students in a clear and organized manner.Some might confuse her strict policies as being a bit over the top but they are in place to simply push students to excel.People need to stop complaining and take their education more seriously!!

    I have to agree with the comment about immaturity. She does tend to be somewhat belittling when it is definitely is not warranted, not speaking primarily from firsthand experience, but from observations from lecture and outside lecture. If I could go back, I would go with another teacher who is not nearly as unpersonable or plays on favoritism.

    Dr. Leclair is undoubtedly the most organized teacher I have ever encountered. Her lectures are clear and she uses language that you can understand. The lectures can get a little boring sometimes but she makes sure there are no distractions so its easy to stay focused. She is a little overenthusiastic sometimes, but great lady and teacher overall.

    This has been my favorite bio class at DePaul so far because I could follow what we are doing. There are a lot of different assignments for this class, but she is a really good teacher. She has really good examples for explaining the material and she enjoys teaching this class. I just wish she was a little friendlier, she could be a good resource.

    A down to earth person willing to help at the drop of a hat.  Her lectures are clear and organized, and she gives many aids to help you master the material.  However, she does have high expectations of her students so be prepared to put in a good effort as she dislikes slackers.  Overall one of the best Bio professors Ive ever had, highly recommend

    I really don't like her. I find her lectures extremely tedious and boring and she goes off on too many tangents. She treats everyone as if they are incapable of simple tasks and seems to talk down to you when ever she talks to you. Maybe she would be fine at teaching another subject but not science.

    shes a good teacher; however, her tests consisted of 50+ multiple choices and it's all based on luck.  40 of the 50 questions are easy.  Then the next 10, you just have to guess.  I got an A because I'm a good guesser.
