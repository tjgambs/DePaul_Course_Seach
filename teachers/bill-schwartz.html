You will have nightmares over the period. I took class with him one period ago and still having bad time. It's really horrible to have professor like this, here at Kean University, NJ; instead, he shoud be teaching at elementary school level.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2006<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst human being hired by DePaul Administation.  The university could have done better by hiring a bum from the streets.  This man was HORRIBLE!!! Thank GOD, he was only a visiting professor.  May he never teach here again!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2005<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst prof i've ever had at DePaul. Doesnt know how to teach & expects students to know the material beforehand. His lectures were 10 mins long per chapter, and if u asked a question, his reply was &quot;you should have read the book.&quot; more than 1/2 the class dropped after midterm. if u want to pass, take another teacher, b/c his class is pointless.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2005<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst professor ever!!!!!! He is an idiot. He wanted to teach an upper level class but got stuck with ACC 102. He is not very patient and he makes the student feel like losers! He spends most of the time concentrating on accounting applications/problems -- but the exam was something different. Do not take him. I think he's a visiting professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher is the worst ever. Most of the class did not get a passing grade on the midterm. Lectures done on overhead,and most of the time you can not see what he is doing. If you dont understand something makes you feel dumb, basically dont take his class if you wanna pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far, the worst teacher I've had.  He doesn't care about the students.  Always sounds condescending to his students, and isn't helpful at all.  He only grades midterm and exam and makes you do homework that does nothing to your grade but lower it.  Don't waste your money because I already did.  Really bad attitude and picks on students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy got a mail ordered bride for sure.  Not friendly, not helpful.  He teaches class like its second grade, flips through cards to determine who to call on. If you go try to talk to him after class he'll have nothing to say to you.  He is horrible, bless your soul if you take him.  Dont waste 2 grand on this class.</div></div></div></body></html>
