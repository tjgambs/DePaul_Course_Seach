He is always there for the students and he just got another degree himself so he knows what it is like to be in the classroom and he caters the class to the students' needs. Easy reading, engaging lectures, straightforward tests, fun group projects, and snacks! Wish I had him for more classes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2015<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Geoff is one of my favorite professor at Depaul. Fairly new but has great outside experience and give real life examples. Pay attention and participate. His lectures are fun and relative. His tests are reasonable. Read the book and you will do fine. He is always available for help. I would highly recommend him. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2015<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor will reach out to you if he sees you need help. He is available for you all the time, doesn't have super short office hours. He is really engaging and goes a great job keeping everyone interested. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2015<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Geoff is a great professor. His enthusiasm to teach students is pretty cool. Finding professors who actually care about students and what they are interested in is pretty rare.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2015<br>Class Name: MKT383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>4 years of college and this is my first review of any professor.   Geoff (Jeff; which he requires you call him) if the best professor I have had at DePaul.  I am so happy to be finishing off my undergrad, having him as one of my final professors.  Former VP of Microsoft sales and makes learning lots of fun.  Don't miss out!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2015<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is your typical general business course, lots of general information and lots of definitions.  I'd recommend taking it with him.  He is pretty energetic which makes the 3 hour lecture go by faster.  He also brings snacks which is great.  The class consists of two group projects, 5 easy quizzes, and 2 tests. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: 383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div> we spent a lot of class time going over assignments for better understanding.  the lectures were frequently long. it would have been better to spend more  class time preparing for the 3 team sales projects.  there a few easy assignments and 3 group projects that have a fair amount of paperwork. overall would take again. would not buy textbooks</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2015<br>Class Name: MKT383<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Alright class. I thought the midterm was pretty easy, but some people managed to get bad grades on it. He has thin skin so challenging him can be pretty funny. The final three group presentations can be tough, so start them right away. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2015<br>Class Name: MKT383<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was pretty easy, but I had a good group - other groups struggled with the cases. He picks favorites and not-so-favorites, and takes forever to respond to e-mails, but he's okay overall. I didn't have any trouble with the material but some people struggled to get B's so I guess it depends on you. Getting an 'A' isn't impossible. </div></div></div></body></html>
