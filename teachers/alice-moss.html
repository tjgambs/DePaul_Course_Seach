    Professor Moss was really sweet and she has had a lot of experience teaching. If you do the readings and projects you will get 100 on the quizzes. Her projects are really interesting and you'll learn a ton.

    The class is mostly a lecture. We watch videos. She asks questions and we raise our hands to answer. We have partner projects and quizzes. There was neither a midterm nor a final exam. She is a very sweet old lady. She appreciates students who exceed the expectations. Easy class if you do the work. On our last day of class, she bought us all pizza!

    She is the best. She is very helpful and cares a lot about young teachers becoming the best they can be. She has the best openers to class where everyone stands up and does a rhyming activity. She cares about what you have to say and does private conversations for experiences at your observations just to make sure you're getting something from it.

    Do not take her. She is extremely boring, she uses the same lectures and assignments over and over again. She does not like differing opinions on anything. Forget e-mailing her because it takes days for her to get back to you, if at all. You will be nothing,but frustrated if you take her course.

    OMG. Ok shes a nice lady but soooo boring! I feel like that class was a waste because I didn't learn a single thing while being in there! We do useless presentations and all she does it go on and on about how teaching was back in the 1960s..save yourself the boredom.

    She is a great teacher. Class can get boring sometimes but we sing songs and do lots of fun projects. She is very passionate about children and is a great role model. Take her if you can!

    Does not deal well with being proved wrong. Ignores the obvious truth. Not very willing to accept other's point of view.

    Ms. Moss is a doll!!!  She is outspoken and passionate about children and their education.  I am not an early childhood education major, but I still enjoyed the class.  The assignments are not terribly difficult, but they each have a purpose, and help you understand the true meaning and philosophy behind ECE.  I would take her again if I could.

    Professor Moss is wise and knowledgeable in the field of Children's Lit. She is helpful, understanding, reasonable and really encourages student participation in the course. Although the course is relatively easy, what one receives from the course as a developing educator is mind-blowing.
