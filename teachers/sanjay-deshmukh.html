Lots of material covered in one class sessionso do not miss classes.  Lots of homework (not graded).  Do every problem as the test is very similar to actual homework problems.  His notes are very good with "simplified" finance language.  Overall, this professor is very good, take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2014<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I went into Investment Analysis with effectively no prior knowledge - just a bit of bond valuation and typical cash flow analysis from Corporate Finance. Deshmukh lectures in a way that forces you to pay attention and do the equationsscenarios with him. I think this is the key to his success as a professor. Do the opt. homework and you'll excel. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor I've ever had. Always ready to help students and teach with all his time and energy. He prepared so much for each class and always made hard things easy to understand and absorb. You'll definitely get a lot as long as you follow his materials and hw. You can really tell he is completely throwing himself into teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2013<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best that I have had in the MBA program. He will bend over backwards to help his students and more than anything he wants to see you do well. His structure and explainations around the material make a complex topic much easier to understand. Take him for 523, keep up with the material, work hard and you will learn a lot along the way</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Deshmukh is the best professor I have had in the MBA program. If you're ready to work and have a strong interest in the field of finance, you will have a great appreciation for his course. His teaching techniques are unmatched and facilitate the learning process. I highly recommend selecting this professor for all of his courses.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2012<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, one of the best professors at DePaul. Class included complex analysis of real options, leases, capital budgeting, and capital structure. Challenging course, like all grad classes should be. A must if considering CFA.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor lectures using his own notes which sometimes contain tedious derivations. Other than that, great professor, no surprises on the exams. Study the material and you will learn a lot and get a good grade. Will take again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2012<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super nice guy.  Lecture was boring.  Tests were moderate in difficulty.  Gives you formulas for exam.  All exams are essay format.  Writing what data you entered in calculator on the test counts as showing work.  Wouldn't say hes a great teacher but i've definitely had worse</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2011<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best teachers I have had! He is so organized and presents everything in a clear, concise manner. Great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2011<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher and very knowledgable, but has very little patience and will get upset with students at even the slightest of distractions. Even if there is an emergency and you need to check your phone he will call you out on it and ask you to stay after class, as evident on a couple of instances in my class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2011<br>Class Name: FIN380H<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is incredibly time consuming. Grades are based on weekly presentations which are based on that weeks material. The presentations needs to be very thorough! He uses a useful program on the projector that is easy to follow, however I found myself copying vs. understanding the material. Difficult topics. Clear but bland. Not an easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2010<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had a very similar experience to previous comments. Kinda hard to dress up the material, so you can't fault him for that. He's one of those solid profs that tells you what to study and then tests you on exactly those concepts. Do the homework, pay attention to his lectures, and you will be just fine. I'd take another class with him, for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2009<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Deshmukh has a very structured course but it teaches the content very well.  There are no surprises on the test, thoroughly goes through each step.  Those without background in the subject matter will benefit greatly.  Would be nice to expand from the base explanations and apply real world scenarios more but overall a positive experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2009<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor. Covers a lot of material and moves quickly but you get used to the fast pace after a couple of classes. Explains concepts clearly and I gained more from this class than most other classes. Tests are challenging but fair if you keep up with the homework which is a must. Definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2009<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Deshmukh is surely not an entertainer but is definitely a knowledgeable teacher for this class. Textbook is required for homework ONLY. You can rest assured if you attend the class and take his notes. 2 midterms and one final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2009<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You know exactly what you are getting with this guy. I find the delivery method to be very effective for this subject matter, given the high volume of formulas and concepts. This does not allow for much discussion, but that's OK. I am a repeat customer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2009<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class provided the fundamentals to understand the material covered.  There wasn't a lot of real world application or room for deviation from the agenda each session.  It was very clear though and if you do the homework and study the notes you will do well on the tests.  Not hard if you put in effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: FIN312<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall he is a good professor.  His notes are very clear, organized and easy to follow.  However, he is not very friendly or personable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2009<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned a lot in this class. I made efforts and studied on my own, but his notes were also very helpful. I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: FIN312<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems arrogant at the beginning, but once you get to know him he's not that bad.  He's a very clear and concise professor, you know exactly what's expected of you. I would recommend taking him...his classes are not hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2008<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good prof, has a better way to explain things can be little fast sometimes but in all ok</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2007<br>Class Name: FIN312H<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible professor. Very conceited, assumes students don't have a life out of class. I asked him for help once, his help consisted of me telling me that I should already know that. I never asked again. Also, he doesn't get grading done in a timely fashion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2006<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really expected much more from Sanjay Deshmukh.  He was boring, dull and seemed really conceited.  He was not at all helpful when I asked him for extra help.  If you can avoid a class with him, then I highly recommend that you do so!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2006<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone taken this class before&#63; or anyone taken any classes taught by Prof Deshmukh&#63; appreciate your feedback, thanks.</div></div></div></body></html>
