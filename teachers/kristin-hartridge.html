She is unclear what she wants and is extremely passive aggressive towards students. If you so anything that doesn't agree with what she thinks she will treat you badly for the rest of the quarter. A lot of papers and she often doesn't explain what she wants until right before it's due.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>She is very inexperienced, does not actually know much about writing. Most of the assignments have zero to no meaning (simply review from high school) Do not take her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2013<br>Class Name: WRT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Had no interest taking the course but had to because it was mandatory and I ended up loving the professor! She is extremely helpful and pushed everyone in our class to pass the course. Her enthusiasm made the majority of students do well. My friends would complain about their WRT class with other profs but I never did. An amazing professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice and knows what she is talking about.  She will help you with any of the assignments.  Go to class and follow directions and you will get an A. Overall a terrific professor.  Take her if you get a chance!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an Amazing prof!

She actually cared about her students, and she is a pretty easy grader. She's very young, but she knows what she is talkking about. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's great.

Young and energetic, great writing teacher for those that normally find it boring.  She sets the bar very low for paper/essay quality.  Would not be surprised if everyone ended up with an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is awesome! Witty and young enough where she seems like a friend, which is good since the class is BORING BORING BORING. but its not really her fault and she tries to make it interesting! I'd recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great class. very helpful and understanding.  really wants her students to succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far my favorite Professor. When I received my schedule, I was looking the least forward to this class, but it ended up being my favorite. Her positive attitude, and teaching style made me excited for class. All the work is very well explained, and she is very helpful.  She not only cares about her students academically, but also personally.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/24/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super nice. Helped out lots. Actually cared about her class and was genuinely concerned about how her students were doing. Pretty easy class. I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This course is enjoyable. Prof. Hartridge's teaching style and personality is very bubbly. She is easy to talk to and she will work with you. The only way to fail the class is to not turn in anything. Overall, it's a great class to take and she is a fabulous professor.</div></div></div></body></html>
