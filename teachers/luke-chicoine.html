I don't know about his other classes, but I love having him as my ECO 105 professor. He wants his students to do well. His exams are reflective of the review, and he is very helpful. Don't complain if you failed his tests because you didn't study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2014<br>Class Name: ECO375<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is good teacher and the subject is hard too. The only problem is you will not able to know what grade you have and he is terrible at communication.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2014<br>Class Name: ECO375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Econometrics is known to be a ridiculously hard course, so I kind of knew what I was up against going into it; however, there was a decent curve, and Chicoine is always around to help you out if you have a question. I ended up really liking this professor, despite the fact that sometimes he wobbled in teaching skills (first time teaching ECO 375)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2014<br>Class Name: ECON359<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is knowledgable, but is entirely unable to make dev. econ. intelligible. Not concerned that the av. on exams is a C (this tendency to teach courses that are too challenging is seen w/ recent PhD grads as they try to prove their status & reify their newly stroked egos). If he is teaching because he wants to do research, fine, so be it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2014<br>Class Name: ECO359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is very into himself. Teaching a higher level class without ever truly explaining it. He moves through stuff. Gets easily puzzled when others ask questions. His demeanor is not professional. Rolls eyes at students. Poor example of DPU economics dept.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>class was decent. he's very clear of what he wants. the online homework assignments are harder than the midterm and tests. pick him, he's prob one of the better econ teachers out there</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2013<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him!

He is extremely helpful and insightful about his subject and teaches the course with ease. You can tell that he is a very caring and progressive professor, and makes the material easy to learn. class is not mandatory, but super helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2012<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>amazing economics professor! if you have the chance take him. class is based on online homework, and 3 tests.  each is worth 25%. if you take a little time to study for this class and do the homework you will do great. & he gives out extra credit too :) i wish he could be teaching eco 106 too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2012<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Definitely take this course. Most of our work is online and the tests and quizzes are not hard. He replies to his emails all the time if you have questions and is willing to meet with you whenever. And offers lots of extra credit throughout the quarter. If you have a choice take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2012<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The tests are not reflective at all of reviews or notes. Class is easy, tests are extremely hard. I studied my butt off for this class and I leave this class extremely confused.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2012<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is very understanding, helpful, and overall a great teacher. The class is very easy to understand, but you must pay attention and STUDY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great teacher! His tests are based on study guides and lectures. Homework is assigned weekly and is online. It's a stress free class, but you'll learn a lot. He's fair and cares about his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2012<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so good at explaining everything! I was so nervous about this class but I ended up loving it because it made so much sense. He'll always answer questions and make sure you understand. He is fresh out of school so he can relate and knows what its like to be on our side of things. The homeworks don't take much time at all. Definitely take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2012<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Thi9s was my first quarter at DePaul and it was his first year teching and probably the best teacher I had this quarter. He explains everything very clear and he is fresh out of school and he can definitely think how we think, making this class very comprehensible. Definitely take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2012<br>Class Name: ECO318<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unclear but this is his first year. Very helpful and easy to talk with. Probably the best looking professor I've ever had.</div></div></div></body></html>
