He simplifies everything and you actually get it.  One of the only classes I truly enjoy going to.  The things I learned in this class are actually relevant enough that I will use them beyond this quarter.  Really nice teacher, he made exerything really pleasant and enjoyable.  I would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: PHY170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher, and I actually enjoyed going to class every day.
