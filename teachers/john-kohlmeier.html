I don't even know how i got the grade i did! Good thing he's retiring.. but i'm so mad because I should have just waited.. arg.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class started as a commercial for his former consulting firm, but by the end of the qrtr learned a lot about IT strategy and the importance of IT leadership. Never read the txtbk, but the casework was killer - use keywords from lectures and you will get As. Participate in class, ask non-controversial questions and get on his good side early.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2007<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Similar to ICS 395 - Mgt Strategy but ICS 395 was more interesting than this class. 2 page papers every week, one group presentation, attendance,& final.  Professor plays favorites.  Grading unclear.  Class is boring and uninteresting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2007<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He rambles and could not be more vague about his expectations.  He wants you to know things he knows about companies that are no where in text and grades you down if you don't use that information.  Grades very hard and is completely useless with getting help outside of class.  Hope he gets fired or quits, because he is your only option for ACC 396</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2007<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very long winded, never stops with random useless info. For participation he simply counts the amount of times you ask a question, quality matters not. His grading is senseless, and he does play favorites.  Hes a terrible teacher, 396 will not be required soon, stay away from him anyways, he talks about the most obvious things for twenty mins</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2007<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, this professor's approach to grading is rather a mystery. Without gving clear directions, he looks for certain words in the papers. If the words are not there and you are not one of his favorites, you will not get an A. it would be the same material as a person next to you who got an A. but... no, you dont get it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2007<br>Class Name: ACCSECT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just like the previous students said, this professor is hard to deal with, a lot of paper assignments, boring classes, grading criteria is a mystery & unfair! Make him love you and you'll guaranteed a good grade. Otherwise, good luck with your grade. He is like weird 70+ years old man. One of the worst(if not THE WORST) prof you'll ever meet!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2006<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The amount of favoritism this man shows is criminal. Assignment questions are very unclear, and his grading is also very unclear.  Presentations are graded unfairly. YOU WILL NOT LEARN ANYTHING from this man!   Accounting 396 is being eliminated from the curriculum but avoid this professor at any cost for any other class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2006<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is a fun class with lots of discussion, however, grading is a bit strange. There are papers due every class, and the method to his grading is unknown. It is a mystery. Also, 30% of the grade is participation. This seems to be more his discretion rather than a true reflection of one's participation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor has no grading criteria therefore, you do not understand the grade you receive. But he is a very smart person - interesting to listen to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2006<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Required class. Doesn't grade effectively; doesn't read the papers he assigns to write.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We had to write 3 papers every single class. One presentation. There's no final (which is nice). I would'n recomend him unless you love to write.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2006<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Waste of time & money!!! Unfortunatelly, this it is required. Very unfair!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2005<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>&quot;I showed up to this class five times and got a C+. Unforunately, even if I had showed up every time, my grade wouldn't have been any better. He grades ridiculously hard.&quot;  What a ridiculous statement.  If you actually apply oneself and work to get a grade you would have probably done better.  Maybe consider another major&#63;&#63;&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2005<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does not do a good job with the grading. he falls asleep through the presentations wo his grading is not very thourough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2005<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kohlmeier is an extremely difficult grader.  You need to give him exactly what he expects.  The first grade that he gives will determine what you get for the course because he doesn't take the time to read students work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of work with random grading, very poor feedback so no way to know how to improve my performance. Alternative opinions are not much appreciated in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2005<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I showed up to this class five times and got a C+.

The material was a huge waste of time, and expect a lot of busy work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is from Harvard and if this is the best they have, then that is the most over-rated university on the planet.  Jokes aside - this class will not prepare you for the CPA, and is a waste of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EASY class but time consuming with a lot of busy work. Good break from pure financial accounting. And you have no choice...he is the only one that teaches. On average, on of my easier classes at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2005<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher!

Sleeps during presentations!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: ACC396<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is an extremely hard grader.  He gave no guidance on requirements for the group project and then grades pretty harshly.  He certainly has the years to back him up but, he could do a better job with HIS clarification skills.</div></div></div></body></html>
