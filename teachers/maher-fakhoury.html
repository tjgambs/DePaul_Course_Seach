He does assign a lot of reading and is a tough grader. His class is challenging but if he sees you putting in effort, participating and taking his class seriously he will assist you in academic success. An amazing professor who try's to make a positive influence on students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2015<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Fakhoury is one of my favorite, if my THE favorite professor at DePaul. He is an attorney himself, so the classes are made much more interesting by the examples he brings up. He is firm, but has a soft spot for those who try hard- if he see's dedication, then you are gold. Absolutely take his class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intimidating at first, but the class is not so hard. It would be hard to get away with not reading. There are reading assignments due everyday, besides test days. Really cool younger guy with good stories to share. I would recommend him for sure. I really got a lot out of this class that is practical to life outside of the classroom. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2014<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor, awesome guy. Be prepared to read a ton and study hard because he does not hand you the grade. But his topics are fascinating and if you show care for the subject, he will definitely meet you half way. My favorite professor at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2013<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far my favorite class & teacher @ DePaul. If you're looking for a blow-off class, this isn't it. But if you're looking to actually learn something & participate in class discussions, this class is definitely for you. He's super helpful, fast to reply to email, & he makes class enjoyable! On a side note, he's young & not hard to look at either ;)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2013<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome,not too tough, funny,& helps students out in any way. He passes out pop quizzes on the case briefings, only if it seems like the class didn't read. Theres a mock trial for xtra credit.He shares personal stories about some of his own cases;if you wanna be a lawyer hes the man to see.it doesn't hurt that he's easy on the eyes either!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2013<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best professors DePaul has and i highly recommend that each student takes his class no matter your field. He is straight forward and firm</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2012<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>omg that bald head is SOO sexy! hes also an excellent prof. ;)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2012<br>Class Name: SOC220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is great if you are interested in crime+Law! He is a lawyer so he knows what he is saying.Study hard for midterm, he makes it hard on purpose! Final is way easier. If he notices some idiots not read, he will give pop quiz. Just participate, he'll like you.TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2012<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of intimidating, but otherwise very helpful. Participation is good, but not a must. Gives an awesome court room assignment paper that seems like a lot but is well worth it. Class is only out of 100 points so definitely study for midterm and final exam. I would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2012<br>Class Name: SOC220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is mandatory & textbooks are a must. Participation is a bonus! Always sucked if one person didn't read, make us take a pop quiz! he is a great teacher, i would recommend study the BOOKS for the midterm, makes the midterm purposely hard and final easy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2011<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Even though he is easy on the eyes for a night class, it annoyed me when he would let us leave an hour or two early.  He does not like people with an opinion/ people who know the information being taught because he tends to not call on people raising their hands.  On a positive note, he's straightforward with his learning and laid back.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2011<br>Class Name: SOC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class, amazing professor!  Not only is he a great teacher, he's also hilarious and makes class fun. He's a former prosecutor who recently opened his own defense firm. When I got into a little legal trouble, I emailed him immediately. He represented me in a small criminal matter and really helped me out. Best professor at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2011<br>Class Name: SOC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher ever! Actually cares and is passionate about his job and teaching. Goes out of his way to make sure you understand things. The class is a little tough but well worth the effort. He is also super hot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2010<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely take this class! The professor is among the best at DePaul and is very passionate about the topic. I found him extremely inspiring and enjoyed every minute of class. Be prepared to do a lot of reading and studying however!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very enjoyable class. He's very good at lectures, following the syllabus, knowing the material, keeping the class awake, and intimidation... he's a practicing attorney. Just make sure you do the reading and homework. Like another post said, you'll love him more if you're into law but he's good nonetheless.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2009<br>Class Name: SOC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class/professor! At first I was discouraged because I bombed the midterm and I ended up with a B+ If you show up and do the reading and participate you'll do fine. He's a really great guy, knows his stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is without a doubt one of the best I have had. He is very helpful & his lectures are interesting. If you like law, take this class!! Make sure you do the readings because you will be embarrassed if he calls on you & you dont know the answer. I was sad when this class ended, i enjoyed it so much. He also happens to be very attractive!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2009<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely helpful. Lectures are actually interesting. He's willing to help you outside of class if you need it. Midterm is harder than the test. You have to go to a court and observe a hearing for your paper which was  a hassle kind of. and... he's pretty hot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love him!
