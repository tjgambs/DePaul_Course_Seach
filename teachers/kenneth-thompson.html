Needlessness he is the worst professor I have had at DePaul. That is saying alot considering that this was my last class before I graduate. He gets of topic frequently and is vague with his assignments. Do not take him! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: 322<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was the worst class that I have taken at DePaul. He believes this undergraduate class to perform like his graduate class. Does not explain material well and gets off topic repeatedly. Gets frustrated when no one understands him and is rude about it. Believes that everyone has a Ph.D. like him and already knows the material. SUCKS. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: MGT508<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not reccomend this profesor. He is not clear with his expectation on the assigments. To focus on his own ideas to realized half the class no clue what he is talking about. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2015<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've never written a rate my professor review before, but this teacher was so bad I would be doing DePaul harm by not saying STAY AWAY. He assumes we all have a Ph.D in the subject matter like he does. Extremely unfair grader, his lectures make no sense and doesn't provide good feedback. Our group would spend 6+ hours on a case only to get a C or D</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2015<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely the worst class I have taken. He doesn't teach at all and on the off occasion that he does talk about management, he talks as if you should already know what he is talking about. When you go to him for help he doesn't say anything and then when you explain your thought process on an assignment he doesn't care. Rude, unhelpful, RUN AWAY!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2013<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is really nice, wish he was my grandfather. However, his content is bad bad bad.  Uses Baldridge Performance Excellence Program based on a Healthcare Booklet.  His job is to engage students, make Measurement of Quality Management an interesting, useful for the future.  This class is a waste of resources.  You memorize, spit back, forget</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2013<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice person but very unrealistic/ unclear expectation.  Mini lectures  he posted for the online class did not relate to the assignments. Had 5 assignments to complete and each took 20 hours to  complete to get a good grade on them. I wish I had taken the compressed class. I am normally a straight A student but suffered a lot in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2012<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so nice and sweet and willing to help. No one got below a B+ in my class. He is funny and willing to explain anything until you understand it better. Heavy reading, but skimming is fine because you talk about it in class. mid term and final both typed with a cheat sheet, two in-class assignments and a easy project. TAKE HIM.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an extremely nice professor who cares a lot about the subject. He clearly wants to see you learn and cares about his students.  As long as you pay attention and participate there are no surprises on the exams. Take the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very laid back and always willing to help students by clarifying ANYTHING! The lowest grade in my class was an 86%. He gives you quite a bit of reading but you go over it in class so skimming will suffice. Midterm, final, 2 in-class assignments and one project that can be done individually or in groups. Lets you type exams& use a cheat sheet!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2012<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Laid back professor. Has done lot of reasearch work in management and has contributed to many articles which he uses in the class. Can certainly apply the theories he teaches if you have some experience managing others. Expect a lot of reading. Overall a good learning experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2011<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unclear expectations.  Goes off on tangents about meaningless things during class.  Talks a lot about Baldridge award but the information is of little use for the class.  The simulation is fun but his grading technique is very subjective. Midterm and Final are somewhat easy  but rather long for time allowed. PPT Slides are poorly done and boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2011<br>Class Name: MGT508<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible professor. I can attest that I thought the others comment about the prof's workload an unfair grading seemed exaggerated, but IT IS NOT. Be prepared to work a ton of out of class hours to complete the workload.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2011<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Look elsewhere. He is very unclear on expectations of projects. The lectures are brutal, hard to stay awake. He is very knowledgeable of the Baldrige award which no one even knows about. There were many class speakers who were also boring. Nice guy, but needs different teaching methods.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2011<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Process mapping assignment (20%) Mid-term and final exams (20% each) Analysis of Baldrige winter applications (20% each). Total possible points for this course 500 points. Not a bad professor; however does a terrible job at explaining the concept.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice, but not very organized.  Many typos in assignments and reading questions. Provides lots of reading, several are things he wrote.  Few in class speakers.  Several group projects.  Easy grader. Does not like to lecture so you learn mostly from the book and the readings.  Book is research focused and puts you to sleep.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2010<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor.  He has extensive experience in the Management field, with real world experience. Not going to be super easy class, but if you don't want to be challenged then do go to college.   If you study, you can come out of this class with a solid base understanding for upper level management classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2009<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simply terrible. He may be funny, but that won't help with the horrible incomprehensible assignments. Talks about a baldridge award for the entire quarter&#63; Nobody knew what it was..other than an award of some sort..not recommended...unless you like useless facts and to throw away your money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this guy! This class is a waist of time and money! I had a lot of interest in mgt (as it's my major) but he just killed my enthusiasm towards it. He doesn't teach (instead he gives you tons of work to do and a hunking report as he calls it), no books,no lectures, and you will get no help from him either! Most owful class I had so far!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a very laidback teaching style with a sense of humor.  His class is definitely interesting to attend.  Homework, midterm, and final can be done in group.  somewhat a tough grader on hw, in my opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2008<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very interesting professor. He has tons of real life experience, however assignments are sometimes confusing. There are 3 group papers, and oral presentation on Capsim. I learned so much in this class. You have to put in a lot of effort and time to get an A, but is well worth the effort..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Thompson during winter break. Although I was only in class with him for a short period of time I enjoyed his class. We did not do anything like memorizing definitions or theories it was all relevant to the work world and to what management most likely does in real life. I liked him and would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NOT recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Thompson was one of the most narcissistic professors I've ever had.  Done a lot of cool things, but brags and rants on and on.  Projects are insanely intense for principles class.  Easily gets off topic into really boring subjects (made Civil War strategy seem boring).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor gives an extreme amount of work but I have never learned so much about management. I defintely recommend him if you have a lot of free time to work on his 4 40hr projects (which you do in teams).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2006<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class. Professor relates concepts to outside material. Management is more than just the business world and that stuff is a nice reminder. Big projects, but prof is willing to help you get the material. Quirky sense of humor. Group Projects.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2006<br>Class Name: MGTCAPS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was great, super nice as long as you contribute during class. If he knows your name, it's a huge plus when final grades are distributed.  If you go and contribute, get C's on your assignments he'll give you a B+.  Take him, get in a group, and you'll be fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2006<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS GUY! The work load is just insane (20 hrs. per project might sound exaggerated, but its really not). Unfair grader as he grades on a subjective view - if you don't agree with his way of thinking, you're wrong. I usually don't mind working for my grade, but along with the many ass. readings and the projects, Im glad to be done ...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>INSANE WORK LOAD! Class worth 500pts, 3'group' assignments, midterm&final each 100pts, but each assignment takes AT LEAST 20hrs! Pretty nice guy, but too much work for just a basic MGT class,especially if u have other classes,not to mention work! I would only reccomand if you LOVE working your ass off!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Insane work load, but a fair grader.  You will have 4 projects that take 20+ hours each.  Overall a nice guy though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tragic. I felt I needed to ask DePaul for a rebate after suffering through this cource. The material was irrelevant and intuitive. Thompson lectured more on his interest in the Civil War than Management Theory. Making this class required is extortion and allowing this guy to teach it is mental assault. You will learn nothing and pay $3K to do so.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was interesting. I looked forward to going cause the prof was entertaining.  He made it so we didn't have to buy the book. He made the subject extreamly relatable and used current topics.  Assignments are tough. Never really sure what he wants and they usually had many steps and many interpretations. Participation points help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Let me first state, you will have to work in his class.  You will have to work HARD.  he makes you work in groups.. your best strategy is to pick a group with the worst losers in the class or the best.  If group members dont help, you get to split up their points helping you increase your grade.  I worked hard to get my B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2006<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you are interested in killing yourself, i highly recommend taking this professor.

You can tell he couldnt make it in the real world, so he teaches instead. I learned absolutely nothing from his class, and he didnt teach anything.
