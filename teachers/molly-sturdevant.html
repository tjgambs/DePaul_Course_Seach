    Great great prof. She made all those crazy philosophy writers easy to understand and even interesting. Her style of teaching/grading is also a huge plus. Just make sure you're there everyday of class and take notes. (It also doesn't hurt that she's tall and quite sexy.)

    Professor Sturdevent was awesome. I thought I was going to be bored out of my mind but she kept the whole class involved.  I didn't do any of the nightly readings and still got an A-.  Easy class as long as you participate.  And she is kind of a cutie pie ;)

    Sturdevant was my favorite professor for my first quarter at DePaul. Her business ethics class was interesting and challenging at times. The textbook is a bit difficult, but she goes over it in class and makes everything really clear. The last 3+ weeks of the course are spent doing/watching group presentations. Not too labor intensive.

    As someone mention type of a genius. Sometimes she gets lost and confused by her own words - and it makes her difficult to understand. However, classes are interesting and most importantly she is a good grader.

    She is a horrible teacher; vague, unclear, and full of nonsense and absurd ideas. Her assignments did not make any sense. The books were a ridiculous waste of time. She's just a BORING teacher, who needs to learn how to teach and connect with her students.

    I absolutly loved this prof. Although she requires a lot of reading, she goes over everything significant in class. If you pay attention in class, you will recieve an easy A. Participate a lot!! She loves students who ask questions and comment on the readings. There are 4 quizzes and two 4pg papers, and a final paper.

    I thought that she didn't explain things well at all. She's very confusing and the material was not explained clearly. I would take this class again, but with a professor that makes the material easier to understand, because I was confused throughout the whole quarter with this professor.

    Excellent prof.Class is tough, but if you pay attention,do the reading,and show up to class you will do fine. She is very helpful.She gives a ton of reading, but it is all relevant and interesting.Presentations were boring and I did not learn much from any of them. I did learn a lot from her though. I would recommend the class to anyone.

    What an amazing Professor. Professor Sturdevant is so intelligent and intriguing. Class was a little boring and the presentations once a week were no help, but she explained difficult readings well. You can tell she is very passionate of the environment and what she teaches.

    Bottom line... the CUTEST prof i've ever had. Not difficult at all,maybe its because I am really smart. Answers questions whenever asked. Gave a study guide which we went over in class for midterm (no paper for us!). RECOMENDED! Made me like philosophy (not really, I ended up just staring at her).

    to b honest i think she thoguht she had to dumb down after the midterm for half the class which is too bad- i was actually doing the readings and was doing well- learning alot. At least shes passionate about the issues and so it all feels relevant.

    She is really nice and helpful but she gives random quizes that if you miss a class one time, you will not know whats on the next quiz or know if there is one at all.  But she is cool and pretty hot. Just read and  go to class. She is big on partcipation. So u have to talk in class.

    The subject is quite boring, but she makes a great effort to make class more interesting. It's a little on the tough side, but she gives you opportunities to boost those grades up. She's such a cute woman and very entertaining with her funny jokes.

    She's very nice and attractive in that nerdy-kind-of-way. She gets annoying after a while, cause you can tell she has her head far up her behind. Nevertheless, SHE'S AWSOME. Very recomended!

    Kind of boring, but she doesn't care if you come to class or not. If you don't read she will explain it all in class anyway.

    She was good teacher on time and understands if you have a problem. The class is more of a discussion all the time, she was always prepared and funny.
