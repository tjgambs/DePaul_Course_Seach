It's honestly an easy A and the quizzes are easy and sometimes they turn into group discussion questions and she gives credit for it. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. She's very helpful and she makes a seemingly boring class fun. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103X<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was the best professor I had last quarter (Fall 2014). She makes the lectures more entertaining by making us interact with our classmates, which is great to meet new people, especially if you are taking a course for international students. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Poncin is one of the nicest professors I've ever had! She is always willing to help without even asking. The papers are easy. I hated writing before this class. Professor Poncin made writing easy and fun! Definitely take her if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is great! the course load is somewhat heavy, but it is an advance writing class. She is extremely nice and helpful, she will meet you outside office hours if you ask her. Class discussion is interesting. She uses the NYTimes so that's a plus.  I highly recommend her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Poncin is absolutely brilliant. One of the most helpful, friendly, and passionate professors I've ever had the pleasure to meet. Pay attention in class, do your assignments, and you will be just fine :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104X<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice. If you have any questions, you can ask her and send email to her. She is  patient to answer you. The assignment is not excessive. Easy A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2013<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>RUN! Unless you enjoy working your ass off and having to go to every class and participate and get called on when you dont want to be bothered. She is nice, and kinda hot, but OMG she takes her got way to seriously and if you dont show up to class she will email you asking what happen? She does lower your grade for not showing up</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Poncin is awesome. She loves what she does and you can tell she puts a good amount of thought into her lectures. Course workload isn't overwhelming and she gives Checks, Check + and - for grades until the midterm and final. Oh, and she's super cute and fun to watch lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2013<br>Class Name: 104X301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is extremely easy, yes it is an easy A...but so easy that I won't even bother to go. She treats students like kindergarden kids. And most importantly she doesn't know how to teach at all. Lectures are pointless and painfully dull.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy going teacher and very sociable. I enjoyed her teaching method and her crystal clear information regarding the prompts in class. Before this class, I thought that gen ed courses were just a waste of class, but this class really taught me a couple of things. Interesting prompts for essays and class discussions. VERY KIND AND ORGANIZED.</div></div></div></body></html>
