    Teacher talks like he has the answers to the universe. Really boring lectures 75% of the time, and WAY too much work outside of class. This class is emulating a real world job, but you don't get paid for the work you do.

    Prof. Jones, is a great teacher, he recently just graduated so he understands students and their needs because he has been there. Java is a hard subject to teach, but he makes he alot easier, available for outside help, gives extra credit and is a fair grader. I recommend him
