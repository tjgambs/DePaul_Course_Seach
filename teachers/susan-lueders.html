It's a tough class, but if you pay attention, she will help a lot. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>She definitely knows what she is doing. If you actually want to learn something, I recommend taking her. It's a difficult class, but she really tries to make it not so bad. We had many online quizzes, take-home stuff, but the midterm and final were really difficult-As long as you print her class notes and study thoroughly you'll be fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lueders is the best professor I've had. she explains everything and make sure everything is clear. she gives out take home quizzes that are not hard. online quizzes are once a week but you get two chances to take it. She really cares for her students and tries to benefit them as much as possible. Take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2014<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady and very helpful. However, it was not an easy class be ready to study Governmental acc (that she says is not a big part of the test)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2014<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If DePaul had a few more good professors like Lueders, then maybe it would be worth the tuition. She honestly taught the class very well, class time passes fast which is  very unusual for any class, especially accounting. She teaches everything that is on the exam and tells you exactly what u need to know. Most students did surprisingly well!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was by far the BEST professor in all of accounting.  Clearly, I thought so because I took her for both 102 & 308.  I HIGHLY recommend her.  Accounting is a difficult subject so none of the professors are going to be really easy, but not only does she make great & organized lecture notes but the tests are not too bad either if you study well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lueders is a very nice lady. She honestly gave off the feel like she could be an intelligent aunt. Introductory accounting classes are difficult by nature. If you're looking for a blow off teacher in accounting you're not going to find one but Professor Lueders is the next best thing. She is so entirely organized and the workload was consistent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She can come off kind of strict, but the hour-and-a-half goes by like a breeze. If you're not a bum, I would suggest taking her, as she expects a decent amount from you. You WILL learn. I would take her again, too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is very helpful in class and office hours just ask for help! she is straight forward with her requirements. she DOES NOT curve final grades so try hard. If something is unclear just ask and she'll explain it again. If you have another professor, drop them and take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall Luders is a good teacher, she cares about you knowing the "big picture" as well as the working parts. I think she is a giving grader if you do the work. I think the key here is to STUDY! I would take her again but this time I would  study more.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very sharp and experienced, probably won't find a smarter accounting professor. It was difficult to keep up with her during class, I had to hire a tutor to reteach me. You really need to work hard in her class or you will fail the exams. Take only if you grasp accounting well. Nice lady though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was really bad at Accounting 101 and was terrified of having to take another class after a summer has past. Prof Lueders completely changed my mind. She is a great teacher that explains everything in clear detail and is very helpful if there is something unclear. Definitely would suggest her, she really does care about the students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hated accounting after 101. Still hate it. So from someone who hates accounting, I highly recommend taking this professor. She makes the subject as clear as possible. Class is midterm, final, and 6 take home quizzes. Midterm and final are straight off the quizzes and she gives a detailed study guide. So study and an A is a real possibility.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Weekly Quizzes. I liked them b/c they kept me on track. Looking back the Midterm and Final, they were very fair. She gives you a study guide that covers it and sometimes hints off a question or two. Sounded easier than Towers b/c they had to do some kind of 4 page page versus our 10 question-answer(ended up being 2 pgs)paper. TAKE!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a student apart of the Strobel Honors program and someone who had no prior accounting education in high school I can honestly say that Prof Lueders saved me from dropping accounting as my major! She is willing to go slow and help students. TAKE!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: ACCH102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wasn't too bad of a class. I would take her again. We were behind so she cut out 4 chapters, so that might not work in my favor in the future. But, overall, she taught pretty well and I ended up with a high grade in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2012<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is really tough. She is a very smart lady and does a great job teaching the material. She does have high expectations and assigns a lot of homework. I would recommend getting in a group to do it and also study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2012<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a terrible teacher. The homework is always way harder than anything she teaches in class. She's very disorganized especially when writing on the board. Also she has no mercy with late homework even if it late for a very valid reason. Don't take this teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102H<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was an alright teacher. A lot of people liked her but she seemed unorganized, especially when she writes on the board which sometimes is confusing. This class sounds like it was a lot easier than Tower. I would recommend the class for the fact that she tells you exactly what is on the midterm and final, which makes studying easier.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great professor, she taught me alot, but she is NOT easy.... Slackers beware</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102H<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's okay. Her final exam was pretty challenging but otherwise not that bad of a class. However, I'd take Margaret Tower if I could go back in time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE BEST TEACHER...super nice and clear and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Susan Lueders is a really good accounting professor. She is great at teaching it and fully describes why and how she does each step. Very helpful outside of class and easy to talk to. She is awesome. I would take her for all my accounting classes to come!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Weekly quizzes, all take home except the first one. Showing up to class counts as participation, otherwise I only talked when called on, still got an A. Tests are hard, but she gives detailed really helpful study guides. Keeps class interesting with her real experience and stories. Definitely take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2010<br>Class Name: ACCCT102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First quiz was in class after that all was take home. She explained stuff in class very well. Now the bad: You will have to participate, can't sit there doing nothing. The midterm and final is tough. Study hard on those or as a poster said, get with a group like I did.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very good at teaching accounting, she uses real life experience to apply concepts so you know why the hell you just entered an ACC 102 class. Her exams are tough so I recommend getting together with who ever is in your class and having a pow wow over your notes after class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2009<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lueders is an awesome prof! She def knows her stuff. She explains everything clearly and all her quizzes were take home except the first one.

She is very helpful, but she assigns a lot of online homework which you have multiple attempts so it's fairly simple. Definately one of the better accounting teachers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2009<br>Class Name: ACC102H<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class went slowly, but everything was understandable. She did a good job going over everything. Online homework and quizzes help boost your grade. Toughest part of the class were the exams which should be easily passed. I struggled in 101, but 102 seemed a lot easier because of this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved the class, hated the subject.  If you like accounting, then take Lueders, she is really nice.  Plus all the homework and quizzes are online, so all you do in class is listen to her lecture. Make sure you always bring in your iClicker.  Other than that, she's nice.  If you don't like numbers DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2008<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice, quizes and hw are easy most are online and are multiple attempts and you get full credit for getting 75% correct. final was non cumulative and our SI teacher ZOE was the best. she curves the tests and is very very fair no surprises on the final surprisingly and she basically tells you what will be on the mid and final. take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lueders tries her best to help all students do well.

Moves fast, but likes to do examples on the board.  Likes using the iClicker; expect to be called on to answer questions.  Tries making things as easy as possible.  Very open to questions.

Midterm was easier than Finals but dont know why she say the final was easier. She goes through the material fast and usually leave early.

She gives you a glimpse of what a real world business eenvironment looks like</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2006<br>Class Name: ACC202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dry material, lectures are very boring and not fun. Really no reason to go to class as everything is available on  blackboard and attendance is not mandatory. Midterm is FIN and Final is stats. Not the funnest class but its short. The biggest downside is if you're just a normal student she doesen't help you out. She def plays favorites.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2005<br>Class Name: ACCT202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you go to class you should get a B or C.  Weekly homework assignments took less than an hour to do.  Book goes along with the subject matter and she posts notes on blackboard too.  Examples used also correspond with what is on the web.  Midterm is a lot harder than the final.  I just wish this was a four hour class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101H<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>lueders is a nice person but when it comes to her class it is very dry and extremely boring.  do not take this class if you do not have a background in accounting.  she flies through the material which is somewhat difficult already.  highlights of class: window washers causing a ruckus, el train passing by window every ten minutes...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2005<br>Class Name: ACC202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So the first half of the class is straight finance 310. Never took finance in my life and got a 65 on the midterm. 2nd half was all business stats and took it and got a 96 on the final. Take fin and bms142 before this and you'll ace it. She isnt a good lecturer and def has her favorites.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2005<br>Class Name: ACC202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lueders is a great teacher, helped me a lot. The class however requires more work than you'd suspect for only two credits. If you don't have time to quickly learn time value and statistics, take BMS 142 and FIN310 before ACC202, because then ACC202 will be a review class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101H<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lueders is quite clear and helpful, but that is not to say her class is not challenging or difficult. Even though she tries to make sure everyone understands the material, you must read a lot and keep up with the homework to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lueders is a great prof who's always smiling in class. She always ties to call on everyone to make sure they are getting the material. She is very clear and easy to understand. If you listen in class and do the homework, which she doesn't check in this class, you will do well. Highly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BLAHHHHH....super boring, way to much homework, FLEW THROUGH MATERIAL because we were always behind.

Just go to 90% of classes and look over her notes she gives u.  Study like 2 hours aday for the last 4-5 days before the midterm and final and u will be fine.

She was very unclear at times and flew through the material. She always assumed that everyone already knew the material so she would fly though her lectures and examples. I was very lost a lot of the time. The class is all time value and regression. If you had stats and finance already, you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!

Exams are similar to HW, No Tricks on exam.  As long as you UNDERSTAND the HW you'll get a good grade.  1 Excel project, which the only work you have to do is plug formulas, which she provides, into Excel worksheet.  Laid back prof. & Easy course</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101102H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows her stuff.
