He is a super nice guy, but he can be very dry and boring. He likes to engage students sometimes, but he likes to talk more. When students challenge him, he sometimes ignores it or dismisses them: maybe he is just a new professor. He drinks a lot of water and paces constantly, so sit in the middle of the classroom. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny and nice guy. Class was fairly laid back, but lectures ran a bit dry at times. Has shorter, easier quizzes and helps you on any clarification if needed. Reading wise, there's a lot, but I didn't read at all, but others told me it helps a lot The textbook, for me, was just a place where I found the needed quotes for paper. Solid professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2014<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Deere is definitely one of the best professors I have ever had: he is fun and inspiring, making philosophy interesting. Take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall I thought professor Deere was a great professor. Lectures did tend to be a bit dry and boring but he did a great job of analyzing the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice professor, clarifying every single point of the text. It was sad to see so many people just not paying attention to the class and then getting annoyed at him. over all, the course was really helpful and exciting for those of us who actually took it seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I've had at DePaul. Very dry class with lessons impossible to understand. Requires too much effort considering the lack he puts in. Stay away from Deere at all cost.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2012<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Deere is very clear in what he expects from you and does a very good job at explaining the material. He is not very prompt in returning papers. The first paper I wrote wasn't returned to me until a month had already passed and I still had not received two quizzes or a paper back by the last week of the quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a fun professor that goes over every detail to clarify for the class. He is pretty lenient and interesting, but the course is the most boring thing I ever sat through. I think around 1/4 of the class is asleep when he is lecturing. Overall, I would recommend him if you're really interested in philosophy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely nice guy! Class is dry but most philosophy is, he really tries to clarify everything that is confusing! I would definitely recommend taking him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class, but its a boring subject. He's a cool guy, nice, and helpful if you ask.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although this class was somewhat boring, Deere makes it bearable. He was very helpful and knows his stuff. Beware, his classes are mostly him lecturing the whole time, but he does encouraging class discussion on occasion. He did great, for his first year teaching and I bet as the years go on he will make a great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really knows the subject well, but unless anyone asks questions or tries to start a discussion the whole hour and a half will be him lecturing. He's a really good guy and I learned a lot in his class it was just boring at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class. Sometimes his lecture could be a bit dry. During discussions he really likes to hear what the students have to say. Overall, a pretty good professor, considering this is his first time teaching.</div></div></div></body></html>
