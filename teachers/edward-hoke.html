Honesty is irrelevant. Be Real No one has a problem with honesty. BTW high school is the past. College students seek to move forward into the future You missed Something you go back to high school or is it already too late,Hoke or a colleague. Doubt that this is a student post</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed his class. He is not like most professors he gives it to you straight. So if he hates it or loves it he gives you the honest truth. If you are going to be in the film world then his honesty is appreciated but if you like things sugarcoated and sweet then go back to high school or don't take a class with this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: DC215<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I HIGHLY WARN ALL STUDENTS TO AVOID THIS ONE at all costs, as well. He's at the top of my list of the very WORST college instructors. Everything the first comment says is true~no exaggeration students; I can attest to it. Ed Hoke is simply a No-No for any class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: DC215<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS! He would nit pick at everything! He only showed us how to assemble the boom once and would not help us outside of class with our projects. The midterm and final are extremely hard (he included questions that were not even discussed in class) He expects you to know everything about sound design...</div></div></div></body></html>
