For a 200-level class, a LOT of reading and many papers. If you're looking to get a religion credit to graduate, find someone else. If you have some interest in the topic of history and religion (perhaps her forte), heck, she knows her stuff and she's moderately fun, you could do worse.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: REL162<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I completely agree with everyone who gave her a bad review! They are completely right! I went into the class thinking yes, she will be hard, but it will be worth it. No! She assigns a ridiculous amt of reading, her grading system is insane and she is not clear about anything she teaches. I will never take any of her classes again!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2009<br>Class Name: REL162<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher makes an intro class on an interesting topic horrid. She has does not communicate clearly. Lots of writing and reading. No clear lesson plan. Laughs to herself about jokes she makes. I am an A student and it was impossible to receive anything higher than a B. Hard grader and she insults students with her views on undergraduates.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2009<br>Class Name: REL161<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kay is the most annoying teacher I have ever encountered at DePaul.  Her tests are way too hard, and papers are impossible.  She also has the most annoying laugh I have ever heard.  STAY AWAY.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2009<br>Class Name: REL161<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst teachers I have ever had at DePaul. Avoid her; she thinks that she is the smartest person and does not care about her students doing well. The way she grades for participation is stupid...she will stop class to check off who spoke and has a very ANNOYING laugh...save yourself the aggravation and dont take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2009<br>Class Name: REL161<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An insane amount of reading.

Instead of teaching, she assigns massive amounts of extraneous reading and awards points for making often irrelevant comments somehow linked to the reading. When asking for help, she insulted my intelligence and interrupted me whenever i asked a question to clarify.  Within 3 years at Depaul, I've never been this miserable attending a class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2007<br>Class Name: REL161<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class as a first year, it was a hard class only if you dont do the readings.  It is a really interesting subject, and she is a great teacher!  The papers ge a little long, but the test arnt that bad.  I hate reading, but all the readings are not that bad at all. take this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2007<br>Class Name: REL202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the worst teacher i've honestly ever had. thinks shes the smartest person alive and treats students like their complete idiots. the tests are very hard and the material is boring. the class is all long, boring lectures that are awful.

Yeah there is a lot of reading in this class, but theres a lot of reading in every class.  The class is very interesting!!! If you do your readings you will be fine, and she will like you.  the test are pretty easy if you do the readings.  You get to drop one test at the end to the tri.

BAD BAD VIBES! She talked about her family for 1/2 hour and I was done. For those who like her - good for you but take my advice and stay away . . .</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2006<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To the wusses who can't stand college: Go home!  Read is easy.  You have no idea!  Read the material, come to class sober and sometimes interject an original thought in your papers and you'll do great.  She's also a nice person and funny if you're paying attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: REL162<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh come on...just because your rich parents pay the high tuition at DePaul, you expect to be handed an A on a platter&#63;&#63;  Who ever said that a good grade would be easy&#63;  She is a great teacher and if you work hard, you'll get the grade you want.  I went into this class sceptical, but left as a big fan.  So quit whining.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: REL162<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is quite possibly the WORST professor I have ever had!  The amout of reading is ridiculous for a 100 level class-5 books+blackboard! She makes you feel stupid for asking questions. Never discusses readings, but are expected to understand them for quizes. 21 students failed out last quiz- and she says it is because or our study habits. hmm...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: REL208ANTHROP<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow she LOOOVES to interrupt you and choke-laugh her way into the discussion, interrupting you STILL. She just can't stop. Its been over 2 weeks, still no returned midterm, she forgot to put up the assignment on blackboard, counts random points for random things. On a paper i redid everything she counted off for; she barely changed my grade. lame.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: REL162<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is an incredibly hard grader and manages to make the dry content even more boring.

Her lectures have nothing to do with the 5 hours of reading due for the day, her questions are unclear, and she eats tuna fish during class. She is delusional about the work load, especially for an intro level class. I dedicate 3+ hours a night to this class and my grade does not show the effort I put into it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2005<br>Class Name: REL162<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/17/2005<br>Class Name: MYTHANDMAGIC<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, very demanding, and requires lots of reading.

The way her curve is set up only works if the isn't a huge gap between the best and the next best.  Otherwise the class was interesting and the reading was a lot but it was more interesting than other religious reading I've had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2005<br>Class Name: NATIVEREL<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she forgets that this is an elective for most people therefore she asigns a lot of reading. she gives good notes that help on the test so be there! but i wouldn't have taken the class if i knew how much reading there is even though its interesting. she drops lowest grade though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2004<br>Class Name: REL202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are looking to work very hard to get a C-, she is the one.
