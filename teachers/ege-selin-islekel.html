Her lectures are amazing and she balances them with group work or films. Get ready to read, though!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Read a lot! Lectures are so repetitive, she milks a topic till she doesn't even know what to say literally! looks down thinks for a while and then she begins talking about the same thing. Her notes look like math formulas, except these don't make sense. Requires participation but leaves you with nothing to talk about because she just ranted it all!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: PHL240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Not much of a philosophy person and was super nervous to take philosophy again given I hadn't received a good grade in PHL 100, but I absolutely loved this class and this professor. The material is interesting and her lectures are wonderful and stimulating. She's a fair grader and the workload is just right. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2014<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely LOVED this class and her! ONE OF THE BEST TEACHERS AT DEPAUL Hands Down! She is passionate and extremely knowledgeable about the subject. THERE IS A LOT OF READING BUT IT'S INTERESTING AND REALLY REALLY WORTH IT. She is helpful! As long as you read and do the work you will do fine! I am changing my major because of this  amazing class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2014<br>Class Name: PHL1OO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly one of the best professors I've ever had. I only took the class because it was required for my major but it was extremely compelling. Islekel makes philosophy real, applicable and stimulating. Hands down one of the most inspiring, thought provoking professors I've ever encountered.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2014<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is great! I really liked her class, and she was really helpful throughout. The class was very interesting and even though some of the stuff we read was very confusing, she definitely made things easier. Yes, attendance is mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a DePaul graduate student who,  assumably had her first time teaching this past quarter. As long as you take notes during class and keep focus to all that she say, you will do well on the essays she gives. Some say her Turkish accent may be a bit of trouble clearly understanding. The course does require attendance. Very knowledgeable lady!</div></div></div></body></html>
