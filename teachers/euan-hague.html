He is anything but charming, but you will learn all about this subject and the way he structures the class forces you to do so.  Certainly not an easy class but one worth taking, great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: GEO170<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy can be an ass at times. Makes you print out 30+ pages of reading a week yourself, and makes an example of you in front of the whole class if you can't afford it. Smart guy who knows what he's talking about. Although, I'm not sure if I understand the point of this class and how it relates to Geography.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: GEO133<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Hague was awesome. He obviously knows a lot about what he is teaching and wants everyone else to understand.

Everything he teaches pertains to the midterm, and will definitely help for the final paper. He is very friendly, yet will be strict if necessary. I really enjoyed this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2008<br>Class Name: GEO170<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so im going against most of these comments. i did not like professor hague. his grading policy did not make any sense at all and his assignments required you to take one side and not consider a counter-argument. i hope i do not have to take him again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2008<br>Class Name: GEO170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So I am kind of in love with Prof. Hague.  His lectures were absolutely beautiful, the class material was engaging, critical and moving.  The papers were challenging and thought-provoking.  The exams asked not only for memorization but also for opinions.  Everything I could ask for in a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2008<br>Class Name: GEO133<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of out of class work.  You have to go to Pilsen at least 3 times to complete the assignment.  You also have to memorize very small details of the readings for the quizes and exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2007<br>Class Name: GEO133<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Professor. He is really cool, but can be a littl uptight. Just do what you have to and you will do completely fine in this. I would definately take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2007<br>Class Name: GEO133<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took his 100-level learning experiential course. Don't take the course level for granted, he expects hard work from you. If you respect him he will show you the same back; if you slack on the readings and half-ass your work you're certain to struggle. (Hard grader and gives pop quizzes)VERY interesting class and great experience in Pilsen. Take it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pah-lease, the department does not require 20 pages of writing for these classes.  Even if they do, most teachers do not abide by the rules, except for him.  he was a really cool guy and made class fun, but it was unnecessarily hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very nice guy, and keeps class interesting.

YOU HAVE TO DO ALL OF THE READING BUT IT IS INTERESTING AND IT ISNT TOO LONG. HES A BIG FAN OF CLASS PARTICIPATION BUT HE GRADES PRETTY FAIRLY ON PAPERS. THE MIDTERM AND EXAM ARE REALLY EASY TOO.

It makes you think about the subject material, there is a clear connection for the whole course. The readings were a little annoying (only b/c I don't like 2 read) but were easy. READ THEM...POP QUIZZES!! Easy A if you apply yourself, take notes, and do the two papers</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: GEO133<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy definetly needs to relax!

But you do have to print everything of Blackboard, which can get expensive.  He gives 4 pop quizzes, but if you've done the homework, they're totally easy.  Papers were kind of a pain, but I did all of them the night before they were due and got an A in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2005<br>Class Name: GEOSCI150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: GEO333<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Psycho.

Class is straightfoward - midterm, final, with 3 papers.  This class is not diffiuclt at all as long as you read, take notes, and pay attention in class - likes it if you participate.
