He makes the class about the students, their endeavors and dreams, and not about following a text book, cookie cutter career path.  Im glad i took this class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2009<br>Class Name: MGT302<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes this quite &quot;common knowledge&quot; class actually interesting!

You do need to participate a lot and read the book. It is a lot of work for a five week class. We had to do 2 reflections per week, an Ind. & Grp presentation and a paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2008<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took as a week-long class. I got 100% on every paper and the ind. presentation, had perfect attendance, and I participated yet still got a B+. Be prepared to share his opinion and pretend like you love talking about your feelings or he'll give you a low grade. fairly easy but prepare to sell your soul and opinions to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: MGT302<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've never had a professor as insightful and deep as Coye. The lessons you learn from him are not restricted to textbooks. He's the real deal,take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2008<br>Class Name: MGT302<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really nice guy.

More of conversation class. weekly one page chapter and article summaries. the thing that got bad in class was the individual presentation, 85% and the midterm paper 85%. very soft spoken, like a priest. recommend taking him if you don't want 2 get stressed</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2007<br>Class Name: MGT302<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice teacher.

He curved our midterm even though the avg was like an 85, pretty easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2006<br>Class Name: MGT302<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.
