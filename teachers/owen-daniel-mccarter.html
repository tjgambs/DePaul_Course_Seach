If you don't take a class by him, you're missing out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wasn't very interested in the topic prior to this class, but Owen completely changed my way of thinking and opened my eyes.
