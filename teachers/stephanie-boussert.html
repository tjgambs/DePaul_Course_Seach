Lectures were clear and to the point. Her tests followed the lectures and study guides. She gave us every opportunity to get a good grade. She has French accent, but I found that I payed closer attention to her because of it. I had no chem background before her class and I'm happy I took her. Would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2012<br>Class Name: CHE132<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Boussert is a good professor, she was always extremely helpful, and she is great in the lab too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2012<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unfriendly and condescending. She repeatedly said the phrase, "This is easy you all should know this!" when someone asked a question, making everyone feel dumb, even though her explainations were very unclear. Better off learning right out of the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2012<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a good teacher!!! The first few classes I had a hard time discerning her accent, but it gets easy very quickly. Her notes are very close to the book which is nice because you don't need to read to do well. She is very clear and even though it was a big lecture, she always encouraged people asking questions and was very helpful!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2012<br>Class Name: CHEM130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She honestly shouldn't be teaching this class. If you want to do well in her class learn the material by yourself. Her accent makes it hard to understand her sometimes and she messes up on problems a lot. She takes off points on her tests for the littlest things so make sure you show your work. Good luck, you'll need it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dear Christ. If you want to have fun and. or learn anything, do not take this class. She is confrontational, argumentative, and takes personal vendettas against students. Her accent is diffucult to understand as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2011<br>Class Name: CHE128<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was nice and helpful, though sometimes her accent did get in the way. No need to read the chapters beforehand, because her outlines are basically word for word from the chapter. Classes are boring if you dont like lectures. Be sure to complete problems assigned</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy teacher, very helpful, don't forget to do the problems in class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2011<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy teacher.  As long as you know how to read and do match, you'll do fine.  She's not going to baby you, but the course load is pretty light.  I didn't study for any of the tests and got A's on all of them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a heavy French Accent which makes it really difficult to understand her.  Plus she hates being asked questions and if you question her exam grading there is a 100% of her being offended at a 95% she will yell at you.  Despite this you can easily teach yourself and do well in the class.  You should bring your laptop to class to take notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Basically, if you read the book, ace the tests, and pay attention to her PowerPoints, you'll do fine. She isn't going to baby you and hold your hand thoughout the class. Take notes, practice some problems, and it's not that bad of a class. And make sure to DO ALEKS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unless you already have a pretty strong grasp on Chemsitry and can basically teach yourself, don't take her. I think she knows chemistry, but just cannot teach. Not to mention there is a bit of a language barrier so she doesn't understand questions well.</div></div></div></body></html>
