He is tough for a reason, he wants you to succeed and is by far the best professor I had since being at DePaul.

Very clear and precise. He will make you work very hard, but you will be better off for it. IE in his TV News 1 class, by the 3rd week we were writing, shooting and editing our very own news packages. Rick is a great professor.</div></div></div></body></html>
