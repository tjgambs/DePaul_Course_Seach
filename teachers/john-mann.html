He will mark off so many things on your papers. He will find the smallest errors in your paper. When he assigns you to read from the textbook, you don't have to read it for hw. He's going to read it the next class word for word. I don't even know why he assigns it. Other than that he is a pretty good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2011<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He reminds of me Dwight from The Office. He is a picky grader but overall not a bad teacher. Just a heads up, when he returns graded papers, it literally looks he demolished everything on the page. Don't even bother trying to read his comments, you won't understand it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although this class was extremely easy, it made me want to pull my hair out every single time. He assigns you to read a chapter, quizzes you on it, then her reads that exact same chapter to you aloud word for word in class. Shoot me. This could have been an online class. He's the worst.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>lectures are really boring. he reads every single word from the book. I don't even bother reading the chapters. He's a nice guy though. He's also somewhat picky with papers. He seems to want everything detailed. He had circles and scribbles all over my first draft. Ok Teacher, but not so crazy about his teaching style.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, but boring. Whenever he assigns a reading, don't bother reading it, since he is going to read the whole book to you anyways. Harsh on papers, picky on each detail and every line of the sentence of the paper. It helps but he just cares about the little details. AND he repeats himself like ten eleven times so that the whole class gets it...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice teacher. He can make class boring sometimes by reading things out loud to the class. We are college students we all can read. Fair grader, and gives helpful feedback. If you use the assignment guidelines while doing papers, there is no reason you won't pass. He clearly states what he is looking for.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, friendly guy. Knows what he is talking about. He gives good feedback on papers because he was previously an editor. Tends to over explain things, like he will read every word on a paper outloud to the class to the point where it's boring. But a fairly easy grader. Would recomend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Lots of feedback on your papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Mann is hilarious.  He is a good professor as well.  His voice is great.  What a freaking character. :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His knowledge has no limits.  If you have problmes with writing, I would strongly recommend his class. His feedback is priceless.  He really knows how English language should be used.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2008<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really knows what he's talking about.  very good teacher and very easy class. highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2007<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really knows his stuff, but is so monotonous. He's a pretty easy grader, gives pop quizzes, and your grade is based on 5 papers. He also looks and talks like Dwight from the Office, so at least he is entertaining in that way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2007<br>Class Name: ENG203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent prof!  My first impression of him was not good, but by the 2nd class he turned out to be a very good teacher.  Very, very, detailed and can be boring at times, but it's a grammar course.  Take him if you want to improve your writing skills.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2007<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mann is a very long winded, detailed prof.  He is crystal clear in what he wants in the papers.  Fairly easy papers too.  Hes very picky, but a fair grader. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's so easy. very fair with his grading. i took him twice got A and a B</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2007<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mann...is the man!!! he is a great teacher and willing to help after class...i took him for 102 and 103 and regretted not talking him for english 104..just write good papers and you'll do fine..boring at time's but highly recommand him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i love this mann (haha), i don't know what anyone is talking about, he is a really good guy, really understanding, very fair grader, and he really cares about how you do. and i did not find him boring at all, i enjoyed his class very much</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2007<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting professor.Been  moments where I was bored in the class and sometimes not. It's hard, but if you take good notes and pay attention to his teaching, you will be fine. One thing good about is sometimes he gives hints away. If i had to chance to take reading literature again, I would take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2006<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was so easy.  I got A and A-'s on my papers.  He is kind of a harsh grader in the sense that he pinpoints very miniscule things to complain about.  Otherwise, he's an average professor.  Boring, though, and like someone already pointed out, reads from the book during lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is awsome, we actually do assingments that will benefit us for the future.

He sounds like a living text book! Ambiguous grading, not very clear on how he grades papers and marks you down for things he doesn't discuss. Assignments required a lot of time and preparation, but were decent overall. I would recommend, but realize he is an ambiguous grader!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>omg i love the mann he is soo funny and a little weird but still one of the best professors here. he is also very helpful and gives easy assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2006<br>Class Name: 102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a good teacher and answered every question anyone had.
