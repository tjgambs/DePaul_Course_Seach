During class he would be very animated, he would go off on tangents and sometimes he would perform little skits that he thought pertained to the text. I found this style of teaching to be fun and engaging, but when it came time to write a paper on the material, I was very lost. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't say enough good things about this guy. He's nice, funny, helpful, understanding. Treats students like adults and knows how to talk to them and draw them into the lecture.
