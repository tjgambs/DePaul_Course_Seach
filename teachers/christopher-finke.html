He was basically like having another student in class, but still teaches well and gets important points across. Very funny/hyper if he drinks coffee! Take him if you can, the class is a fun time!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really cool guy & teacher. relates well to students. Class work isn't hard, a lot of reading but focuses on the process of writing rather than hapring on each paper & grade. not too overly challenging but requires some effort.</div></div></div></body></html>
