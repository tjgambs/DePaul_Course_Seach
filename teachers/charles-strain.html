I had him for a social justice course and I learned more on the topic in that one class than I had in my entire life. He is intensely passionate about human rights and makes the class enjoyable for everyone. Do the reading and you'll be fine. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2013<br>Class Name: HON<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for senior capstone. 25 hrs of service, 6 essays, 2 presentations, readings, attendance mandatory, grades fairly hard, AND had to watch a 2 hour movie on our own time. I along with 4 other students (out of 21 students) got B+'s. Not a blow off class. He's nice, but this class will eat up your time. I would NOT take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2012<br>Class Name: JUNEX259<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Requires a lot of reading! A lot of reflection essays! Final was easy but this class requires a lot of work. Requires service learning. If you aren't interested in helping other or philosophy DONT TAKE IT !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2012<br>Class Name: REL259<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down, one of the best teachers at DePaul.  Coarse requires reflection essays and take home assignments and you MUST do the readings for class each week. Other than the required work, he is an amazing professor, whose extremely passionate.  If you can take any religion class, take it with Strain.  You will not regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2011<br>Class Name: MLS101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OUTSTANDING professor, and OUTSTANDING person. Has devoted his life to teaching his  students. Knows his material, conveys it perfectly, but more importantly cares about each and every student.  Wonderful person.  Challenges the idea of God, but secretly is a firm believer.  thank you Doctor Strain, for everything</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: PSC235<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him as joint taught class with Prof Block.  Strain seemed okay, but wasn't able to talk much over the other Prof.  He was slightly boring, but not too bad. 3 papers and quizzes every class. You need to go to every class otherwise you don't get the handouts and wont be able to take the next quiz. Avoid this class- the prof may be okay.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2011<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful professor. PhD from UChicago, so obviously very knowledgeable. 3-hr night class but it went by unusually fast! The special topic was poverty and climate change, and was fascinating. Everyone should have to take a class like this. You must read, but selected readings are not textbooks, so it's easy! Participate & and you'll succeed</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2010<br>Class Name: REL285<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely LOVED this class. very insightful. really cleared up my image on the Catholic religion...pretty much a born again christian b.c of this class. and learned a lot about Buddhism. Essays were very easy for me b.c I was interested you HAVE to do all the reading in order to do well (skimming is fine) I recommend this teacher and class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2006<br>Class Name: CTH346<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooring</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2006<br>Class Name: ZENMIND<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely knowledgeable on topic and willing to work hard for students. Brilliant man.  However, he demands lots of work in turn. Reading assignments are lengthy and difficult with papers each week.
