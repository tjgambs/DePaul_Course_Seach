    Do EXACTLY what she says in terms of what the assignment is asking for and you will get an A. In papers, write what she wants you to and ask her if you don't know what she wants. The lectures are boring and long so make sure your phone is charged to keep you entertained. Find a good group too or the class could be hard.

    Her grading is very subjective, and she made what was suppoesd to be an easy class more difficult. Her papers consist of &quot;opinions&quot;, yet she takes off points, WTF&#63;

    Sticher is so easy. There is one test and 2 papers. You have to be an idiot not to get an A. Show a little interest, talk to her after class and you will get an A...if not perhaps you shouldnt be in the marketing field..

    She assumes everyone in the class dreams to be a salesman, so she gears the class towards how to be a good salesman.  All assignments and papers are 100% subjective and her grading is strange, so if you don't understand what's going on in her red head, you won't do good.  Annoying accent, and again assumes everyone wants to be a salesman like her.

    So easy. Do not buy a book, you will not open it once.  1 little test all from the powerpoint presentation and it's common sense, 1 main project and it's sooo easy.  Good teacher, however, if u have a 3 hr class, u may get bord but overall EASY.

    This trick gets on my nerve. She counts attendance and every other week, there's a company presentation. 50% of the time Target will show up. I put a lot of work into my group project. Just make sure you have people in your group willing to do work. Tests and papers and easy as hell. She gave me a B+ because I left and hour early 1DAY!!! TRICK!

    This class is not bad. But participation is very important. Make sure you talk a lot otherwise she will take off a letter grade down.
