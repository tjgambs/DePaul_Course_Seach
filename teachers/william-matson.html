Ask for help. He won't turn you down. He gives extra credit as much as he can. His grading scale is a little different too (in your favor), so there's really nothing to complain about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2011<br>Class Name: PHY310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

He makes nerdy jokes, and if you're taking PHY 310, you're a nerd, so you'll love them.  He's also quite fond of puns (he made at least 10 today, but he was on a roll).  I would recommend this professor, who assigns a lot of homework, which is weighted evenly with the midterm, which I find quite fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: PHY172<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what the first person is talking about.  Matson was and is the man.  He does teach certain things in a much more thorough (difficult) way than necessary, but in the end it just helps you understand the concepts that much better.  The class was a beeyatch, but he curves everything to make it reasonable.  Would love to have him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST PROFESSOR AT DEPAUL did not teach at all! laughed in your face if u asked for help tutors had to teach formulas to class that we never saw before. actual words he said&quot; everyone failed assignment b &quot; so lets NOT discuss it . the class average was a C in this easy A class! hard mid term/final T/F is worth the same amount as a workout problem!&#63;</div></div></div></body></html>
