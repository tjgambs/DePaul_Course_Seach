He is careful and honest and will help you or just BS with you if you both have the time. The class is challenging, but worth the struggle. I hope all students have a teacher like this or this teacher himself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2011<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Shanahan was a great teacher. He really made a subject that seemed very dull fairly interesting with his knowledge and enthusiasm. He knew a lot about other subjects as well and could always relate what we were talking about to something else, whether historical, literary, film or pop culture. Workload is farily light and the grading fair</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2010<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Read the material and find at least one thing to say about it. It is obvious that he does not want the entire class period to be a lecture. He appreciates participation and attendance. He gives you all the tools to succeed and is eager to answer questions in class. My only complaint is that he's difficult to reach by e-mail. Awesome professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2009<br>Class Name: ENG471<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shanahan is one of those rare professors that manages to be informative, helpful, effective at teaching the topic and easy-going all at once. I learned everything I needed to know in a required class in the MA program and always enjoyed myself-- never felt overwhelmed. He is quick to respond to emails and is good lecturer. Overall a great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2009<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Shanahan is awesome. He has a lot of fun teaching his subject and enjoys hearing what his students think about it, as well. He encourages participation which is very important to his class and understanding the material. He's extremely laid back and talks to students like we're just hanging out, not in a class. Great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2009<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Shanahan is an amazing teacher.  He has a lot of energy and really makes the subject fun to learn. He is extremely helpful with paper assignments.  If you work hard, you will do well.  Great guy!  Take him!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2008<br>Class Name: ENG439<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shanahan is a fantastic professor.  He encourages/expects class participation and is open to new ideas and interpretations of texts that he is an expert on.  I worked insanely hard in his class, but he rewards and recognizes hard work so it was it all worthwhile.  TAKE HIS CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2008<br>Class Name: ENG339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shanahan is extremely well-read on Restoration literature, and is sincerely passionate about the topic.  His passion is contagious and I learned far more from this class than I anticipated.  Papers were easy, discussions were well-rounded, somewhat intimidating because he is so intelligent.  Great course, great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2007<br>Class Name: ENG431<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class.  I was nervous about the reading load before taking the class, but it works out. Make sure you read though...classes are small and most of the class time is devoted to class conversation.  I learned a ton and Prof. Shanahan is super helpful and accessible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You need to read! A lot of the readings are confusing and not interesting. He calls randomly on students. Pop quizzes on readings and written final. Okay professor. Wouldn't take again. Brought my 4.0 gpa down with an A-!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>John is very entusiastic about what he teaches.  He brings life to literature I would otherwise hate.  His grading is fair and he is super understanding of various circumstances that come up in the life of a college student.  Don't try and take advantage of him, but he is seriously one of the most lenient professors I have ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: ENGLIS380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't say enough nice things about Shanahan.   If you take this class you won't be sorry.  If you're a fairly decent writer then you're bound to get an A in this course because most of your grade is based on the essays.  Take him if you can!  Very easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2006<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's sooo great. Take his class! Very knowledgable but also light-hearted and makes class kind of fun. Readings are all very interesting and he engages his students by asking them to speak up. Class Breakdown: Weekly Pop Quizzes, 3 5-6 page papers, written Final. Pretty easy class overall and he is a very encouraging guy. Love him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2006<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>John is an amazing teacher.  He keeps class interesting and cares about his students.

Very helpful and available during office hours.  His obvious affection for what he teaches is infectious. I got an A, which I totally deserved, because I worked really extremely hard, because I wanted to impress him.  Because he's hot and brainy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor, very helpfull, wants you to do well in class, answers all the questions.

He has an attendance policy but I missed about 15-18 classes and still got a 'B+'. I would have gotten an 'A' if I didn't miss so much, but it was still cool that it didn't affect my grade too badly. Take him, you won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2005<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor--really grows on you.

Very helpful, wants you to do well in class, class breakdown: &quot;pop&quot; quizzes (he warns you about them), 2 simple &quot;production critiques&quot; (5pg.), final paper (5-6p) and a final exam. Easy class, I got an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2005<br>Class Name: ISP211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so entertaining in class, and very understanding.

If you participate in discussion, you'll be fine, but class can sometimes get stale. Papers aren't hard with topics he provides.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2004<br>Class Name: ENG339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He expects a lot of work from his students, but he is reasonable when it comes time for course grades; even if his paper grading is tough. Lets students control discussion. A very good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2004<br>Class Name: ENG339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher.  has a clear knowledge of the subject and is enthusiatic about teaching it.  one of the best teachers I've had.  expects a lot, but definitely worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2003<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shanahan pretty much lets the students take the class where they think it should go. If you don't do the reading though, you're screwed. If you don't go to class, you're screwed on the paper. Great times here. Whoever wrote the first rating is in my class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2003<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There was a lot of reading involved, but the class over all was wonderful.  the whole class is just a round group discussion about we think happened in the reading.  the book we read were great, too.  the number of papers are definitely fair, too.</div></div></div></body></html>
