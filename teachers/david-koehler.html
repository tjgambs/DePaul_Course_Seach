His stories are great and he is very entertaining.  He knows his stuff but gets easily sidetracked.  If you show up, pay attention and do the minimum work an A is almost guaranteed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2010<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2009<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Having Ko Ko as a professor was one of the highlights of my college career.

Drag your ass to class every morning, chill back and listen to hilarious stories. Knows his material but makes it relatable. Take Koehler you won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2009<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I get a smirk on my face when I think about his classes. Granted he has more stories than Walt Disney himself, but that's just his 'charm'.  Group projects were hysterically funny during my quarter. He is very helpful when you ask and has great resume samples. Most entertaining during my four years at De Paul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is clearly a doosh, but he cracked me up. His stories and lies are legendary and he will do whatever it takes to get a girl in the sack. All and all the class is a joke. Just do the minimum and receive an A. (He treated this one guy in class real good, called him a loser and told him to write I'm a loser on the board 100 times, haha.)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher was pretty cool. He tried to give everyone in the class good grades and curved the tests. He teases many of the students but he's pretty funny. It seemed like we really didn't learn alot in the class, its more like he talks about random things. The quizzes and tests are all from the book and he tells you what is on them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2009<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing Teacher..rocks my WORLD...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2009<br>Class Name: ECON191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor to ever live!

Not hard at all, the work is easy and as long as you do it, you will be fine!I wish I could take him again. If you can handel straight forward honesty, then take him. If not bad idea.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't buy text! He appears to be an easy prof, but make sure to go to every class. If you miss one class it will affect your grade! Turn everything in! He is not a hard grader so if you do everything you are supposed to you will get an A. However don't blow something off, he marks down hard for late assignments!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Koehler is a legend.  His class is easy and you actually enjoy going to his class.  Anyone that hates on him is out of their mind.  I'm a slacker and i got an A.  He's hilarious and keeps it real.  You will actually learn things from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2008<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Koehler is a gift to all DePaul students! He keeps it real and makes class interesting as well as current.  There's a lot of haters on here but that's probably just because they didn't assert themselves. He allows you  miss an entire class if you tell him, class gets out early everyday, and he's always there for help.  Take this guy it's awesome</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2008<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does talk about himself A LOT, but very easy class.  He takes a lot of of the presentations that you have to do, so as long as you do well on the mid-term and the group project you will do good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2008<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>class easy, like he says do it on time and put some effort to speeches and ull be ok. no tests. his moods fluctuate he was cool in the beg. towards the end he was an ass and flipped out about everything he even called two of my group members and screamed at them.  speeches are easy but the last one you need to be perfect so make him look at it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2008<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Koehler rocks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2008<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don?t listen to the other idiots on here. He is a freakin awesome teacher. He?s very opinionated, but he also makes sure you actually learn something. The class is not difficult at all. If you just so happen to be European he likes you even more! Other than that he was one of the best professors I have had at DePaul yet. Brighten your horizons peop</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has to be the most ridiculous teacher I have ever had. I wonder how he still has a job. Everything everyone else said is true. I got an A-, but should have gotten an A. Instead of meeting all 10 weeks for an hour and a half, we met for 5 or 6 weeks for no more than two hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Keeps the class entertained with random stories about his life a, but you end up teaching yourself the material since he barely goes over anything useful in class. Pulls his questions out of seemingly random lines in the textbook, which makes them harder than they should be. Also a bit loose with the usage of stereotypes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a funny guy but terrible teacher. He doesn't explain the material well. I had to learn most of the stuff from the book. He's a fair grader though, I'll give him that. IF you're looking not to learn anything and get an easy A, take him. pays a lot of attention on girls. Talks a lot about himself. He's selfish and inconsiderate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2008<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Koehler is an awesome teacher. Really funny during class and keeps the class entertaining. I would really recommend him for a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2008<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The kid who posted on 1/17 needs to get an understanding of what, &quot;down to earth&quot; means. I had no problems with him, but he can be extremely offensive to other peoples beliefs and values. Yes, he is arrogant and obsessed with his bachelor life style. Gives two tests, class is almost always let out early, and he even ends the course 6-7 weeks early.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2008<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Have taken him twice and enjoyed both classes more than any other courses at depaul.  He really keeps things interesting and brings a lot of experience to the subject, not to mention a really cool, down to earth guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2007<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class professor is little nut...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He grades in favortism and does not teach. Just shows up and talks about his plans for the weekend, take him if you want a little study hall break in between other classes, what a joke.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2007<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was complete joke.

I haven't learned a thing, he should spend more time actually teaching the material and stop talking about himself and his other students and their great presentations. If you need this class, find a different professor.  Don't waste your money here!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2007<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is crazy! He made me so uncomfortable. As all the other people said, you will not know what grade you will get and when you get your grade, you wont know why. I got a B+ and im not complaining, but I could never take this guy seriously. Take if you understand stats very well or if you can become one of his &quot;favorites&quot;.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2007<br>Class Name: MGMT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will learn nothing and you will have no clue why you got the grade you got.  Your feedback will be - solid or weak You won't have 1 lecture. You will never open the book.  Grading is completely subjective.  Loves to hear himself speak.  Grades will be submitted weeks late.  You will spend tons of time on group proj so find good grp members</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is extremely into himself and says that he doesn't want to teach the class so, therefore, he doesn't. You basically have to teach yourself. Tests are harder than he says (read everything). He WILL help you if you ask. Don't be too intimidated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2007<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Spent too much time talking about all his accomplishments (a real Jack of all Trades/Master of None) and none actually teaching.  His comments on the presentations were suppose to be helpful/insightful but actually were  &quot;like it&quot; or &quot;didn't like it&quot; w/ no reason for the like/dislike.  No actual marketing  taught - just all presentations</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really like Koehler. It's a stats the class; the same stuff we learned in BMS126. The class is boring so he's always telling stories to keep it upbeat. I enjoy the class and enjoy him, even though he is whacky and a little out there. He makes us laugh!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2007<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE LAST COMMENT AND THE COMMENT ABOUT HIM BEING A ****. HE THINKS HES A GOD BUT HES A CONCEITED OLD JERK. I NEED TO LEARN, NOT HEAR ABOUT YOUR ****S.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2007<br>Class Name: MKT202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy crams all of his personal accomplishments within the first few weeks.  Apprentice story, jogging with giraffes in Africa, ex arena football player,single/divorce/lot of girls like him....who gives a damn...just teach the class the right way and shut up..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2006<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He tries to act like he's a buddy in the beginning of class, but he's a jerk.  He decides to have projects, big projects, a few weeks before finals.  Also, he's disrespectful to women, constatntly but does it in a way that you feel like an ass for calling him out on it.  He's good at it, too good.  Be Weary!!!  But, his class is easy as long as you</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He came to sub for Hillman who had so many problems throughout the course that he was our 4th and final professor - LOVED HIM! He makes class so fun.  He is extremely hyper and energetic and will make fun of anyone in the class.  Never stopped laughing, but still learned.  His advice for future jobs, etc. is GREAT! Very helpful and will do nething</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2006<br>Class Name: MKT305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He looks like he is very hard but not really.</div></div></div></body></html>
