    Laith is the best professor I have taken at DePaul! This is my second time having him &amp; I still love coming to his class just because his lectures are so eye opening and hilarious! He relates lessons with his own personal experiences!If you haven't taken him, you're def. missing out! I would 100% recommend him for any of his classes!! #ILoveLaith

    Love this guy. Simply put, amazing, inspirational, and hysterical. His lectures are eye-opening and simply great. Definitely recommend him for any class! Check Benedictine University's library, they have the book in a pdf for free.  #LaithForPresident

    Laith is, simply put, a badass. Everything else you've read about him being an Easy A and being super smart is all true. Show up to class, engage in intellectual discussions, do minimal reading, write a good final paper, respect Laith, and you'll do great.

    He is really relaxed about his teaching style. Just a midterm and a final group debate/paper. The class was about Islamic culture yet I really don't remember much about that at all. My final debate was on capitalism. He's really chill and the class is an easy A. He cancels every now and then too.

    Anyone who thinks Professor Saud is arrogant is clearly insecure and jealous of the man's charisma. The class seems easy because Professor Saud knows how to lecture and keep his students engaged in a discussion that's enlightening and refreshing. Take his class, he's by far the best professor I've had at DePaul.

    In addition to all the comments about an easy A ( which is true) the professor is one of the most knowledgeable and intellectual professors I have come across. Great guy to talk to outside of class

    My roommates told me to take him because it was a guaranteed A. And it's true, this guy gives good grades just to please students. He tries to make Islam look trendy even though it's a Religion. He clearly bases grades off who he likes.  I'm Muslim and did all my work well and he gave me an A- when I deserved an A.

    Great teacher. Very professional and knowledgeable. Clear speaker and very cool, down to earth. Professor Saud does not believe in grades, so if you want a class where you'll learn alot and still pass pretty easily, take his class!!
