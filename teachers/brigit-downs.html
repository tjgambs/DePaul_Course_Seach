She is a native speaker, but I feel that is why she is not a good teacher. Yes, you will get an A in the class, but will you learn anything? no. She cares about her students, but does not know how to teach german. Language is a class you take to learn, not get an A. Therefore do not take if you want to genuinely learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2011<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took German Discover Chicago with her. We went on many German-related field trips, such as: The Holocaust museum in Skokie, Lincoln Square, & The Chicago Symphony Orchestra. I got an A in the class. Participation is a big part of your grade. She gives extra credit. She is an extremely chill teacher. German is her first language.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2011<br>Class Name: GER106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Frau Downs ist am Besten!

She is so sweet and kind. She is very helpful and very nice. Her class is moderately easy you get a lot of points for showing up to class. Any time you dont know something even on a test she will help you, not give the answer but help. She is great. Take her if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2011<br>Class Name: GER103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really nice professor who wants her students to do well. I am horrible at speaking German, but I have never had below a 100. There is tons of extra credit. As long as you do the work and look over the material before a test, it will be an easy class. You recieve 5 points per class for attending, so go to class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2011<br>Class Name: GRM101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Frau Downs is probably the best teacher I've ever had!

I loved my German teacher in high school and was afraid i would hate my college prof.  I love her she is super helpful and she gives you no reason not to get an A.

Shes great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2010<br>Class Name: GER103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Frau Downs is a very nice teacher, she really cares for her students and wants them to do well.  She outlines what she expects from you and gives plenty of opportunity for extra credit.  It was an easy A, but I did not learn as much as I would have liked.  This is not all her fault though, had I put more effort in I would have learned more.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: GER102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Frau Downs is great!!!
