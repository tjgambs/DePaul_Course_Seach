His assignments and classroom activities are pointless and excruciatingly boring. He is unorganized and tends to contradict himself. He claims to be extremely professional, but he treats students like children. He has a terrible temper, and has no patience or interest in helping anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tim is a TERRIBLE professor!!  You may like him at the beginning of the quarter, but you will love to hate him by the end.  He is very disorganized and you never know what is due because assignments are listed in five different places.  Also, while this is supposed to be a business and professional course, Tim speaks to the class unprofessionally</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2008<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is honestly one of the worst teachers I've ever had. Do NOT take him. Too much work and he has his own system of grading which no one understands and is really unfair. Do NOT take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2008<br>Class Name: CMN255<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so annoying!! For being a person in PR is so disorganized that its frustrating. The material he covers is so meaningless because all he talks about is his old job at sears... who wants to work there&#63;&#63;&#63;!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2008<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>tim is probably the best teacher i have ever had! attendance was mandatory but that is bc you meet 4 times a quarter for this class (and you still get 4 credits!). He is so helpful, funny, and just wants you to be successful. I am taking another class with him and i cant wait. he is not really hard grader and lets you do things over. TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2008<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a total tool. Worthless class, he talks about his old job at Sears and his claim to fame is sending satellite dishes in pizza boxes. So boring too and to make it worse he thinks he is amazing. His laugh is enough to make me not want to go to class. Spare yourself the agony.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Way too much work for a class that meets only 4 times.

Pushes you alot. Sometimes amusing, sometimes annoying. 4 meetings, all required. Harsh grader at times. Couple job assessments, memos, weekly online readings/response. Portfolio/mock interview was the big thing, and most beneficial.</div></div></div></body></html>
