Likes to keep class alert. Class questions helped, the test questions are similar in difficulty. If you understand the class questions and why answers are right AND wrong it will help you. Your grade is 3 exams which is good bcuz it means less material for each test.

Take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2013<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Ryan makes 380 a lot more enjoyable than it could have been. He is very interactive in his presentations, which helps to remember a difficult subject. The topic takes a lot of studying if you want to do well though, so don't expect to squeeze by. A lot of students did not like him, but I think it's because they were not willing to study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't lower your grade for missing class, but the quizzes are based on the lecture more than the book. Attend all classes. The material is difficult but he makes it as easy as possible. He will award extra points for attendance. He really cares about his students and patiently explains all material. Take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2013<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor for a generally challenging topic.

I highly recommend. Go to almost all his classes/ do well on his "take home quizes" and he'll hook you up with 3% or more on your final grade. Man was extremely successful so he knows recruiters too. If accounting is your major get yourself noticed. Also really nice guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor.

He wants you to do good, picks on everyone in the class, which could be good if you are distracted easily. quizzes were easy, midterm ehh, final was fairly easy if you study class notes. nothing to tricky.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2013<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Probably the best I've had throughout college.  This is not typically an interesting class but he makes it one. He genuinely wants you to succeed. I strongly recommend taking him. It's not easy but he will teach you what you need to know and the rest is up to you.  An A is definitely attainable in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor ever.

The material itself was very difficult to comprehend. I thought his final was much more difficult than his midterm. This is definately not an easy class. Study hard!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2012<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor is very helpful. His stories are easy to relate to the material. He has a great command for the subject and knows how to teach students. One of the best accounting professors here. You will have to put in a great deal of work. He is not easy, but you will learn from him. Exams are tricky. Do study guides, and HW questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2011<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT Professor! His lectures are interesting, he always tries to make them fun and relate them to real life. Make sure you do the class questions because his exams are exactly like them. The final exam is definitely harder than the midterm, so STUDY HARD!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Accoounting professor I have had. He is really helpful and cares about all of his students. He hands out outlines of each chapter and makes it clear what you have to know for the exams. Besides all of that he is a great individual with a wonderful personality.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT0<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I worked by butt off in this class. I'm not the smartest person in the world, but ended up with a B in this class. But enough about me, Bob was a really good Instructor and cared about his students. Won't give you any extra credit, or show you any favorability. But WILL help u as a student and wants EVERYONE to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down best professor ever. Wish he taught everyy class. Provides notes and quizzes(not collected) to help you. great lectures that are also clear which helps when it comes to the crazyness of taxes. Tests are very similar to quizzes and review. AND he cares about his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2011<br>Class Name: ACC548<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>True to what the professor says, tax is a different beast than accounting. I found it tough because there are a number of exceptions and clauses to tax laws. Study hard for this one!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best ACC 101 professor you can take. He does examples on the board, goes over homework(doesn't collect/grade), interacts with you during class and doesn't just lecture, and holds incredibly helpful review sessions before the midterm and final. I probably gave this class a 6-7 effort out of 10 and got on B+.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Ryan is not only a great teacher, but also a great guy.

Ryan is currently the adjunct professor of DePaul University. He obtains the M.B.A. from famous Northwestern University, M.S.T. and Bachelor degrees from prestige DePaul University. By utilizing long term teaching and practical experiences, Professor Ryan shows us the interests of the accounting profession.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is hands down the best accounting teacher at Depaul!

I felt as thought I was pushed and challenged as a student. He will make u CPA ready, but will help with any trouble spots during office hours.

He tells long, tedious, and confusing stories the entire class while completely disregarding what he's supposed to be teaching.  He never uses the book, only his own notes, but all of the quizzes, the midterm, and the final use the book, not his notes.  And Cengage is useless, don't waste your money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Guy has an huge ego. He tells the class review @5 and shows up an hr late with no explanation. He is a decent teacher but his test are next to impossible. With a big curve the Avg. was below a C. He uses questions from the actual CPA exam. I understand he is a teacher & we're student but he acts like you don't deserve to breath the same air as him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2010<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor in depaul.

Randomly calls on students but not in an intimidating way...you will get used to it. Spends much of class time giving examples, so it requires studying outside of class if u want a good grade. 20% 6 quizzes (1 drop) 35% midterm and 40% final and 5% lab. Recommended, take Bob if you get the chance!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2009<br>Class Name: ACC501<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stern but fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2009<br>Class Name: ACT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ryan uses real life examples to help clarify his points, which is good if you do not have an accounting background.

However, thanks to his notes it's at least somehow easier to understand. There were many questions not answered or that couldn't be even heard, though i woulnd't blame the teacher for that; there is simply to many chapters for this class and it's impossible to cover all of them in one quarter PERIOD!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had for both ACC 101 and 102.

Very nice and helpful professor. Take him over any accounting professor at Depaul. All other accounting professors are too serious and think they know it all. Not helpful at all. Wendorf is one of these, she thinks she knows it all and is not helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely funny and great professor.

Midterm was harder than expected and he makes you write a paper comparing annual reports. You should attend every class so you don't fall behind because his tests seem to cover everything in class.</div></div></div></body></html>
