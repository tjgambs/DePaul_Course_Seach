Ridiculous. Avoid. She's knowledgable, smart, and funny but completely out of touch with what a workload should be for a 100 level class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2013<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>She is extremely knowledgable, and it was awesome hearing someone share their passion so in depth. However, she's very disorganized, like anyone in an art field would be (myself included). That being said, she lost my final paper. Her class is easy enough, just pay attention and the final/midterm is all that really counts, the readings are useless</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes one of those teachers that you could just sit and listen to for hours. Her knowledge on the subject matter is truly inspiring even for people that aren't interested in the topic.  I found it humbling to be in her classroom and to learn from her, hell she studied at the Vatican!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2011<br>Class Name: HAA232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows a lot of first hand knowledge about medieval art. Huge workload, but all relevant. Just do the work and youll be fine. I know hardly anything about medieval art and now I find it very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Solway is incredibly helpful and she knows what she is talking about. As long as you pay attention to lecture and participate you'll do fine. She also gives extra credit oppurtunities and is available for meetings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone who says that this professor is &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;hard&quot; should have paid much more attention to her. Solway is an awesome professor and everything about the topic is related in different material. A lot of writing and participation, but overall she's helpful and clear about what she expects. DO THE READINGS AND PARTICIPATE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She very passionate about what she teaches however she is very rude,not helpful or approachable.Do not take her as a focal point. You have articles due every class with 100 pages combines plus 2 page journal entries to each of the articles. A 10 page research paper, 2 inclass essays and a presentation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2009<br>Class Name: ART202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Solway is great! she knows her stuff and makes class interesting with her real world experience. About 3 quizzes and 2 research papers. The class is all about power point slides and memorizing them. Read the book and you'll be fine. Not hard at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2008<br>Class Name: ART233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had no interest in art, and i never really enjoyed going to museums. After taking her class though, i have a new appreciation. I think Solway's great, and she is so interesting to listen to, since she know's so much about what she teaches. As long as you do the reading and attempt for a good great you'll get one. Please, take her class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2008<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>way too much material for a 101 class.

Interesting lectures that sparked my interest in the subject. If you pay attention in class and read then you should do well on her tests, you just have to be willing to put in some effort. May not be good for those with no interest in art history, but I recommend this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2007<br>Class Name: ART233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof and great class.

She'll say one thing and do another.  She isn't helpful either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2006<br>Class Name: ARTH101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I graduated from Barat College in 1990 with close to 20 elective credits in Art History thanks to Dr. Solway's incredibly engaging lectures. She's earned the right to be tough - she knows her stuff and clearly loves her field.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: ART397<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Solway is highly knowledgable of the subject matter, and has a wonderful passion for it. Her lectures are incredibly interesting. She had very high expectations for our class, and it was challenging. I enjoyed her so much that I didn't mind all the work. I learned a ton!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2006<br>Class Name: ARTH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the absolute best</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: ART223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING! I actually got out of bed with my boyfriend to go to her class. She inspired me to love art history. Weird, huh&#63; Go to class, take notes, and study. (You will actually enjoy doing all three of these things.) Her passion has infected me! Fair grading too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: MEDIEVALART<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didnt study for the midterm and I got a 95.  She glares at you if you pop your knuckles or talk, but shes enthusiastic and this stuff is pretty easy - there was not a plethora of slides we had to know - everything was relavant.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2005<br>Class Name: ART224<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The teacher is boring&incompetent. She is unable to make slides available on the internet or to give a study guide to clarify her lectures that are all over the place. She is condescending & all she wants you to do is memorize buildings and sculpture with no context or overriding point to the lecture.Im writing the Dean if our money is paying her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: ART381<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Solway is nothing short of engaging and extremely interesting.  The lectures illustrate her superior knowledge not only in content but in teaching style.  She fired my enthusiasm for learning and created an environment that strives for excellence.  Wanna enjoy school&#63; Take a course with Dr. Solway.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: ART224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Solway is one of the best teachers at De Paul.  Her excitment for art is infectious and she doesn't expect too much from her students.  Take her her courses you won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2005<br>Class Name: ARTHISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Solway is very knowledgeable in her area of study, but the problem lies in the way her tests are given she runs through things too fast and has a habit of playing favorites since she did that with a group of students who kiss up for an A.Students have fallen asleep in her class which says a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2005<br>Class Name: ARTHISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Solway is the absolute best teacher I have ever had.

Can't get better than Dr. Solway!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2004<br>Class Name: ART397<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my fave teachers at Barat! Her classes are definitely challenging, so you have to pay attention, but she really knows her stuff and is such a nice lady.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2004<br>Class Name: ARTHISTOR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes a cool professor but when it comes dow to grading extremly unfair and very unclear about her grading procedure. I got really good grades on the tests and quizzes but i ended up with a c+ what the hell. Trying to email her about all summer no respone</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2004<br>Class Name: ART397<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best art history teacher at DePaul.

There's 2 quizes, a midterm, and a final. If you're into art history you'll love this class, if not, you'll like her, but not the class. There's a lot of memorizing to do. You'll never get out of class early!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: ART<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Solway is very excited about art history and she tries to rub that excitement off onto you, but it just doesn't work for me.  However, she is a very intellectual professor and a fun person, and she is usually 5-10 minutes late for class.</div></div></div></body></html>
