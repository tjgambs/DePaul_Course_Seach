I understand the joking manner, but joking manner aside that'll only be hurtful as it only created the atmosphere of people not wanting to add to the class. Which got him upset that there wasn't any active participation. Jokes are to be a suppliment to the learning, not the base to learning.

One would think it's a no brainer that these types would have run from St Karl Marx after Stalin or at least after the Soviets did and Chinese comrades decided to keep the facade while making fortunes on the backs of peasant-comrade-slaves. Put up a sign: &quot;Gucci-Marxism Soiled but still Styling!&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2004<br>Class Name: HST219<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very rash at times, even though things are said in a joking manner towards students, at times it's better left unsaid.  Seems like he doesn't know when to stop with the jokes.  Definitly someone who keeps you awake, but I wouldn't recommend him as a prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: HST205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a lot of work in this class but I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the class not so much the work.  I recommend if you want to take this class you do not take a lot of difficult classes.  You got to stay on top of things and go to all the lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2004<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes history interesting, cannot pronounce the Aztec God's names but overall he makes history fun but is VERY strict and tough in the midterm and final.  LOTS of k.w to remember but U will learn much.  He should have shown that he cared for his students</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: HST205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He teaches a pretty demanding class. Papers is one thing.. but you need to do book reports in Latin American HST.  I got an A in the class... but I had to work at it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: HST205<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2004<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the best teachers at de paul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2004<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite teacher from DePaul.
