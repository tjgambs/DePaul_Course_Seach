Most of my class did poor on the project and tests (tons of Ds and Fs). However, the poor scores were definitely not Dr. B's fault--the class had to have been lazy!  I got 100% in the class, so I know it is possible to pass.  Take good notes and you are good!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exceptional professor that understands the learning process. Teaches with full class participation-seminar styled environment. Rare. Not blind memorization that's practised in 98% of all university level instruction and passed of as education. A gem. Highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2006<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome instructor! I had her for Social Psychology and my capstone class, History and Systems of Psychology. She truly does make learning fun. A lot of instructors can take a few notes from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2006<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>there is busy work to do but it is not hard at all! the only tough thing is the takehome midterm/final. other than that very good and id take again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2006<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Dr.B for Research Methods I & Abnormal Psychology and she is an awesome professor. Her handouts for Research Methods will be useful for 242 & graduate school. She is very helpful to ALL of the students in her class and I highly recommend that you take her for whatever she is teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2006<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. B isn't hard but she does require a lot from her students. Weekly online (open note) quizzes, weekly blackboard discussions, a term project, a midterm take home and a final take home. She provides pleanty of extra credit to help you out too. She is so nice and easy to go to with questions. She is funny and actually enjoys what she is teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2006<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is such an easy and nice teacher..i missed so many classes, got c on my paper and final but still end up getting an A- in her class (by doing extra credit)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>History and systems was made much more bearable with Dr. Browning. She's sooo sweet and always makes sure the class understands the material.  The quizzes are a bit hard, so you MUST do the reading. The reading does prepare you well for the take home exams, so that's a good thing. Take her, she's great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2006<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took for History and Systems.  She seems like a hard prof and expects a lot, if you do all the work, you'll get an A.  She had a weekly quiz on blackboard, and the take home midterm and final are easy if you take good notes.  Make sure you attend every class and take good notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2005<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. B will bend over backwards just to get you to understand something.  For the material that she has to work with, the class is interesting.  She realizes that the material is boring but she is such a sweetheart!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME! She knows how to help students get through a boring class. It's not her fault she has a boring class. She is a nice person, just do your work. She literally held our hands through writing our papers, she actually teaches us what we need to know. I wish she taught more classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is soooo boring.  I have had material that was just as dull and the professors make it more exciting. I think she just is not good at lecturing and I have friends that say she was rude to them when they went to talk to her. I just would never take her again because she was so boring. She may be nice person outside of class but I don't know&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: RESEARCHMETHOD<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT professor and a GREAT attitude for a hard class.

After the Stats class I had with her I look for every class she teaches. She is one of the nicest profs I have ever had, she actually cares about her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very sweet lady.  Her notes are very clear and she wants to see everyone succeed.  The material is boring and she knows that, but she does her best to make the class as painless as possible.  I look forward to having her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2005<br>Class Name: HISTORYSYSTE<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was the poorest regurgitation of information ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2005<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is vague about the final project and most do poorly on it. When I revcieved A's for everything else and questioned my grade, she just said she &quot;did it based on her criteria&quot; which she was &quot;very explicit about,&quot; (which she was not) and forced me to have B for my final even though she said she would take my other grades into account.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2005<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was not looking forward to taking research methods, but she the class easier on her students.She understands it is not the most exciting PSY requirement and is extremely helpful and does everything she can to make it better.Grade consists of an open note exam, online quizzes, weekly assignments which are steps to complete the final paper-Take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2005<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The homework that she assigns is the hardest part. a lot of work but she makes it easier by explaining it and she is always helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2005<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dr. browning is fantastic. true, her lectures can be a little dull (although rarely), but i tend to think that has more to do with the material. she expects quite a lot out of you, but given the fact i took the senior capstone with her, i believe that it will only help me out in the long run.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2005<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unorganized and annoying. She is very vague on her expectations and takes forever to grade everything. Her notes are not online but she gives you a study guide for the midterm.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2005<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class, but SHE is a very nice lady, and she does everything possible for you to understand the class.

Also, it gives a good overview of psych's long history, and it's fun, despite the need for a lecture format. I recommend it if you want to prep for the gre or just really want to know the history of psych.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Research methods isnt a fun class. But she tries making sense of it in a fun manner. Shes nice, considerate, helpful, and an overall good person. If you wanna get by Research methods without destroying yourself. Take her. Tests are hard and so is the homework. But it prepares you for the real world.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2005<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. B is great; she really wants you to do well and like the course even though Research Methods is boring. She's more interested in making sure everybody gets it than in making sure everyone's had to go through all the proper drudgery. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is extremely hard under her.I don't know if it's the layout of the course required by the department or if it's just her, but there are soooo many assignments.A reaction summary once a week, a quiz once a week, a huge project, and two take home exams that are extremely difficult.Good luck</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2005<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is nice but that is about it.  She is probably one of the most boring professors I have ever had.  I could not stand going to her class.  All the other students complained how boring too.  NOT VERY HELPFUL AT ALL. Does not explain her assignments well.  A bad instructor. but NICE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2005<br>Class Name: PSY240241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a nice teacher.

I have taken many classes with this prof. and I highly recommend her. As long as you take notes or have a friend who does when you can't make it you are golden. Teacher cares about students and is willing to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2004<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was not excited at all to take Statistics and I assumed it would suck no matter what. Dr. B made it interesting and she was fun to have as a teacher.
