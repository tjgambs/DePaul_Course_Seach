His class would be doable if was willing to actually help you with your coding problems but he only gives you subtle hints that leave you more confused. He takes forever to grade assignments and his teaching method is not helpful at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2015<br>Class Name: CSC301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Duru is a really tough professor. He expects alot from you, would not help if you're stuck on your codes. If you are great at java, take him. If not, I would definitely take it with someone else. </div></div></div></body></html>
