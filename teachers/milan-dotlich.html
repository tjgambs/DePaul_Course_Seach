Class is fairly easy. Homework is due weekly but does not grade it, you receive points for turning it in. Midterm and final. midterm is take home. For the final he gives you 40 questions and chooses 20 of them to put on the final. Do not have to attend class. All the answers can be found online.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2014<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Weekly hw (2 quick problems), take-home midterm and in class final for which he gives a list of about 40 terms and you have to learn information about them. Questions on the midterm are not too hard. Overall, if you put in effort you will get an A in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2013<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is super easy but very boring. Weekly HW, only 2 problems from the book. Take home midterm & can work w/ a partner, still don't know how some people failed it. He gives about 30 questions to study for final and chooses about half of them. Super easy if you study. I felt like I wasted my money on this class since it was extremely boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2013<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is pretty boring and kind of dry. BUT if you do the weekly homework, the mid term is take home and you can work on it with a partner. The final he gives you a review and pulls questions off of it verbatim. Very easy grader. Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2010<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good slides and heavy use of text book.  Take home mid-term and predictable final exam.  Lots of class participation - good content.  Student presentations were good exercise - but not necessarily informative. Would recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2010<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He talks very fast and you must be focused to catch his explanations. There is a take-home midterm test and a final test that is based on a certain number of questions he gives you a couple of weeks beforehand. He also works as a consultant outside the school and you can see this from the way he approaches and solve real life problems.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No homework in this class, just small presentation, midterm and final exam.  You definitely need to attend class to get professor's explanation and study the slides to do well on the exams.  His slides and presentation are much more helpful than the textbook.  Would recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Milan is honest about the challenges of the subject. It's not an easy subject by any means, but his experience and knowledge keeps your interest. He is a great networking tool, as well. I love that he is truly there to help students meet their career goals. He has my respect.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Milan is a very good teacher. he knows the subject well. Its very easy to get an &quot;A&quot; in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Milan is a straight-shooting teacher. He is an Operations Manager and teaches part-time. He has a lot of experience and does a decent job going through the slides, however reading of the text is a must! There are individual presentations which are done throughout the course.  Take-home midterm (kinda hard).  It was a lot of work but it paid off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor gives a pretty good lecture but, he is not the greatest. Easy course and pretty easy to listen to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2007<br>Class Name: MNG301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attend all classes,participate,study a bit and you got yourself an A.Great for networking though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2007<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Milan is slightly arrogant but a really nice guy.  He sets you up for success with a take-home midterm and a study list for the final.  The material isn't too exciting, but it's easy to get him to talk about more intesting stuff if the cl**** gets involved.  Plan on participating, he gets to know everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was impressed with his knowledge but at times found it hard to keep up with him, since he talks so fast! I think he tries to be intimidating the first class but after that it's smooth sailing. Worked hard for my A, and I learned a lot. I truly enjoyed learning from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2006<br>Class Name: MGT502OPS<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I may be the only person to go on record and say that Professor Dotlich's effectiveness is nominal.  He'll continue to garner great ratings as his personality plays well to the &quot;cool guy factor&quot;.  That is not the reason for taking the course.  He has not yet matured to the point where he leaves his personal likes and dislikes out of the classroom.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher and knows his stuff.  Class participation is a must and is thoroughly encouraged.  Good class to network in and I'd suggest pairing up with someone for the take home mid-term.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>03/30/06  i had the prof for the fall quarter. Knows a lot of material- applies his work experiences to the subject. grades range from b- to and A. Find a good team. A good team will get you  the A. More, hes very willing to help, and is realistic. The class is not boring, you have the option of leaving at 8. rest time is hw review.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2005<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Only real minus - The class was boring at times as everyone had to do a 7 to 10 minute presentation.  So every class you had to sit through 30-45 minutes of presentations.  Good points - Take home midterm, 4 - 6 hours to complete.  Review questions for the final.  Not to badd really.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: MGMT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor was laid back and treated students fairly.  His class was challenging but not impossible.  Midterm was take home.  Overall, a good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2005<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Milan is a very good teacher.  He takes what I consider an extremely mundane subject and makes it interesting.  You dont need any calc. for this class.  My only suggestion is dont take it in summer school as you get short changed b/ of the shortened duration.  Overall he is well worth taking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2005<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mid-term is take home and requires about 4-5 hours for preparation and response.  Final is based on questions provided before hand from a list...this ensures you know your stuff.  Despite the threats, you DO NOT need to know calculus or statistics for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2005<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Presents material well.  Has fair amount of work-related examples.  Assigns homework but doesn't collect or grade.  First exam was take home.  For final he provided list of review questions and pulled exactly from that list for exam.  Note:  also required to give a 5 minute presentation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  Assignments and exams are challenging but not impossible.  Midterm was take-home.</div></div></div></body></html>
