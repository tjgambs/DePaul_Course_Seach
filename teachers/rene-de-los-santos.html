He has a good sense of humor which keeps lectures interesting. He challenges you in a positive way and seems really passionate about teaching. Great professor and class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rene was an awesome professor. He was a super easy grader and was really lenient. He's the professor everyone wanted for WRD 104 so you'd be lucky to get him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rene is under-rated on this site. He knows what he is talking about, his lectures are far from boring and all he wants is for his students to leave the classroom with something newly learned. Only complaint is that he does show  many boring films.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2011<br>Class Name: WRD360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rene is awesome! There is a lot of reding for this class but it is super interesting and you will actually enjoy doing the readings. Other than reading there are 2 pg reflection papers due every Wed and 1 group presentation. No midterm/final. Take it! You will learn alot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2010<br>Class Name: WRD260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor!

Very knowledgeable and will give you lots of insight.  Assigns lots of reading but there is little work otherwise and only about 2 assingments are actually graded with an actual grade.  Easy class to do well in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!

He is super easy, easy grader, only have to do 3 short papers plus little in class writing assignments and he's pretty funny and easy going!  Really enjoyed his class and if you take him for a night class he only makes you stay for 2 hours at the most!!! TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: ENG200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor, easy going, but obviously new to teaching. Seems a bit tough at first, but is not as serious as he puts on. If you are required to take ENG 200, take him.</div></div></div></body></html>
