She grades tough but gives little explanation for her grades.  Her class is disorganized, trying to teach you rhetoric, writing, and environmentalism, but does little of each. Boring, daunting, and unenlightened; if I knew this, I would not have taken the course</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She will take any opportunity to tell you about her son or about the neuro-science book she's writing. Homework assignments are easy and mainly consist of reading and response-writing. I think I generally liked her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: ENGENG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures are not always on topic, but she's brilliant.  I figure if I stay in her classes long enough, her superior intelligence may rub off on me!  VERY ACCESSIBLE and HELPFUL outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2006<br>Class Name: EXPLO101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is vey frustrating</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2006<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, easy A, straight forward assignments, attractive professor. What more could you ask for&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am surprised by the criticism Prof. Skolnik received! I just finished her Tech. Writing course (204) and I LOVED it! Yes, she will go off on tangents occasionally, but she's very charming and funny about it.  She graded at a professional level, and I have used alot of the info on document design, arrangement and making graphs in other classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2005<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're a CTI major or have any experience with technical writing, the class is really easy. Just pay attention to the requirements of assignments and it's a breeze. She's also very nice and very flexible... but does go off on tangeants.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2005<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She kind of gets off topic sometimes (I can tell you so much about her son), but she answers all of your questions as best as she can.  For tech. writing, she's a really easy grader, and she is willing to look over all of your work before it's due.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2005<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not extremely clear, and she goes off the subject all of the time (I can tell you so much about her son), but she is an easy grader.  She shows you how to make the graphs and charts you need to put into the papers and she will answer any of her questions.  It sounds like she is pretty tough for rhetoric, but for eng 204, she was pretty easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2005<br>Class Name: RHETORIC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grad level class. Vague lectures unrelated to the material and expectations. Importantly, we had to write papers on the material we read PRIOR to hearing the lectures on the same material. Very tough grader - especially bad since you're on your own in figuring out how to execute the assignment. Warning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Skolnik is a decent teacher. She sometimes gets off topic and classes seem irrelavent but the assignments weren't too hard and she was very willing to look over my work and make corrections.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: ISPEXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a total valley girl. She doesn't make sense and she goes on tangents all the time. SHe exploded on our class because a pop up came on her computer screen. She is crazy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2004<br>Class Name: ENG208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It looks like the people in ISP had a bad time but taking this teacher for English makes her a totally different person. Very easy quizzes if you read and listen to lectures which does keep on topic. She let people rewrite papers and no real complaints about her from me. I recommend taking this clas</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WARNING DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS! I had to take her class but her lectures did not have anything to do with the class. She is a very tough grader. She is extremely boring. I will never ever take any class with her. Don't take any classes of hers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2004<br>Class Name: ISP100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She talks over almost everything, but nothing's relate to the class. Her quizzes were hard, and she's A tough grader.
