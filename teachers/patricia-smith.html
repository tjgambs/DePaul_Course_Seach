She is pretty clear and basically tells you what to study for mid-term and final though, that is her best attribute. She has a weird grading scale though where adding up the points don't actually get you your grade either. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2015<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of your grade is based on team work--my only complaint. The syllabus seems intimidating, but Prof. Smith is very nice and the work is absolutely manageable (if your team isn't completely worthless). One of my least hated accounting classes. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2015<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very specific in what she is looking for and very clear as to where you got points off. Her lectures are informative, and the tests have no surprises. Ultimately it't not a hard class but does require work. There's a group assignment every week (not all of them are hard) and one group formal. Put the work in and you should get a good grade. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2014<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>She is very approachable and checks email frequently. Her fill in the blank as we go along style lecture notes are the exams, along with a few short chapters from the novel sized book. Lots of group work in any ACC350 class, and she takes it seriously so check everyone's work b4 submitting. I would definitely recommend.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Smith is very professional, nice, and a decent professor. She had a few slip ups in the class but who doesn't? I think she prepared us for her finals but not to the degree I would have preferred (for example she just told us to study with a little review in class). I got an A but I had to study</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Acc was always hard for me but Prof Smith is a very good teacher. Her material on take home tests is pretty hard and you must study for her exams.

The material you learn in class is completely different from the quizzes and HW. She doesn't curve and tricks you with everything from quizzes to the midterm and final. Avoid her if you can because you will see no results of improving.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard quizzes in the beginning with a tough midterm and takes forever to grade papers.

Take someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has her own unique style of teaching. This causes a lot of consfusion, because her notes are not always very similar to the book and she will often give assignments and quiz questions where the book will not help you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As people have stated before she talks very fast and she will also make quizzes very complicated for no good reason at all. It doesn't matter if you know the material, if you're not familiar with the type f questions she will ask then you will struggle. If you find accounting easy, this professor can make it very difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quizzes are much harder than necessary. You can easily fail them even if you feel like you understand the material in class. Take someone different if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not like most accounting professors. The questions she gives you on quizzes and are incredibly difficult. You'll think the stuff easy in class but that is not the case. I compared the questions to the questions that my friend's professor had and his were much easier.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The quizzes are impossibly difficult. You can have an easy time with the homework and assignments but the quizzes are way harder that you would expect having breezed through everything else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you thought ACC101 was easy then ACC102 will be a lot easier.  She is a very helpful teacher.  Be sure to go to class and follow her notes. I never used the textbook and did well on her tests just going over her notes and the online hw.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Smith is crystal clear when it comes to her lectures.

It wasn't easy for me. There were quizes about every other week. The midterm and the final was pretty tricky. It doesn't help that she talks a little bit too fast sometimes, but just ask her to repeat what she said. On the bright side she is very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2009<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>her notes were crystal clear. if you didnt read the chapters but studied the notes you wouldve gotten a good grade. and yea the midterm and final was probably hard bc students didnt put enough effort into it. this is an intro class, so there must be a lot of freshman taking it that dont understand that they need to study!

I loved her! Cares about students, prints out notes so no need to read text, puts everything online so don't need to go to class. You either got it or you didn't.

She talks too fast and Does not offer any extra credit.  She is only giving extra credit because the college of commerce is making her give it to people this quarter.

ACC 101 is one of the hardest courses at DePaul but with this professor you'll ace with no problem!
