She's a really nice person & is cool, but that won't help you when you have no idea what she's teaching and students end up correcting her in class. She even calculated my course grade wrong where I had to ask her to change it & prove she was wrong. If you have to take her, good luck-it'll be LOTS of teaching yourself what to do.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2015<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As they say.. the teacher makes it or breaks it. She has a great personality, but should not be teaching. 3 tests all multiple choice and they are very hard, final is 40% of your grade. She makes at least 10 mistakes every class and then waits for the students to correct her errors. Do not take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2014<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took intermediate accounting part I with Du and did poorly. Then I took intermediate accounting part II with another professor and got an A! So you can see how bad she was. I was completely with her in class but got killed on the final. Final was insanely more difficult than what she taught in class. GPA killer</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2014<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she frequently made mistakes, solved problems by copying whatâ€™s in the solution manual on the board, never further elaborated on them, offered no insight whatsoever into the materials. She's inconsistent as to the order in which warranty expense and warranty liability should be journalized, got me very much confused</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2014<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Every time she ended class 20 minutes early. And at least another 15 minutes were wasted every time as she left us doing exercises ourselves so she could stand around and do whatever she was doing on the computer. That left her with only about 50 minutes to lecture for a 90-min class. I wonder how much she skipped that should have been covered.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2014<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Du was overall a good teacher. She did occasionally make mistakes while going over problems but she teaches you what you need to know. She is straightforward and willing to help you if you ask. Her lectures are fast paced but she does go through plenty of examples. I would recommend taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2013<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst ever, took her class and learn nothing but calculation. She didn't know how to explain the material and only teach you how to get a right answer. Midterm was ok, but Final was a disaster, it was way too different than what she taught in class. She should do research instead of teach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2013<br>Class Name: ACC306H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best honors accounting professor I've had at DePaul so far! Cares about her students understanding the material. Exams are fair but hard, study her slides and examples! Record her lectures; it helps come exam time. Makes a few mistakes on examples, but catching them helps you do it right on the exam! I'd definitely recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2013<br>Class Name: ACC306H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests are really hard even if you understand what she is saying.

Frequently made mistakes during class and her tests are insanely difficult because its all multiple choice meaning you get no credit for being partially correct on major concepts. Definitely avoid</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm curious as to what changed from the way she used to teach because my experience was completely different than the last few comments.  Of the six different accounting professors I've had at DePaul she was easily the worst.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2010<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok so she doesn't use the book which is great cuz I HATE that book. she only uses it for problems and examples. there is a group project and yes you need to present it but her exams are not so bad. she goes though the big written problem at the end in detail and of course there are MC questions. for sure take you but I wouldnt say its an easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2010<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE THIS PROF!!! PLEASE DO URSELF A FAVOR AND TAKE HER! She puts so much work into making sure we as students learn every bit of the book without using the book... hard class because it is accounting but she does not make it impossible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I only with Ning Du could teach all of my accounting classes! The group project is graded on effort only - she tells you to put down ur book and actually teaches methods that make this class super easy! She will prepare you for the CPA without killing ur GPA. 100% worth taking.. study, do the hmwk -go to her if you don't understand go to her office</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2010<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the comment below.  An &quot;A&quot; is definitely possible with hard work because leases/pensions are challenging when you first begin trying the problems.  The group project is challenging, but actually kinda fun.  Choose your group members wisely, as this is not a one-day group project, but rather done over several weeks.  Start after midterm</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2009<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Come on guys, get with the program, what else did you expect&#63; its accounting, but she does her best at explaining the material to students, she is crystal clear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DEPAUL KEEP THIS TEACHER! I've never seen an instructor so devoted to her students! She will go the mile to make sure the material is crystal clear. She comes up with methods that make the tough part of this class CAKE.

BEST BEST TEACHER I'VE HAD!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2009<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am not sure what people are saying, but she is hard! She sometimes does not even know what she is talking about, which makes us confused about the material.  Overall, though, she seems like she cares and is nice.  She is very knowledgeable, though.  If you are up for the challenge...take her (I do not recommend). Otherwise, good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2009<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Du is amazing. She has a heart for her students. All the IDIOTS who use her accent as an excuse for their bad grades r morans. She tells u exactly whats gona be on the 2 tests. Go to every class, do the HW, and you will get at least a B-.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall she is a good professor. Sometimes clarity issues on the material will exist, but nonetheless she is always willing to help and cares a lot about her students' success. The tests are average difficulty for an accounting class but she is very nice about making sure you at least get a C. I've had her for 101 and 304 and recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't understand why anyone would say Du is a good professor&#63; One thing that really ticks me off, is she ends class 45 minutes early every class, versus teaching students the material until they understand it. Her tests are HARD. I aced both written portions but got killed on the multiple choice. Avoid her, she is a waste of your college money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2008<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class with a great professor! Explains concepts really well (unlike the book sometimes) and will help you as much as she can. Grade: 40% Midterm, 10% Attendance/Homework, 50% Final.

Accounting can be very hard (especially the first courses) but she is able to explain it so that everyone can understand it. The final was indeed hard, but that is because it is a standardized one of the accounting department. She made me love accounting!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ok she is NOT bad. Her accent must have gotten better because you can totally understand her. Yeah the subject is hard but she tells you whats going to be on the exams. Study the slides (multiple choice questions) and do the homework. And she is super nice and willing to help!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2008<br>Class Name: ACT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken other accounting classes at this point and let me tell you, it's NOT THE TEACHER, it's the subject! Which is quite hard but she has been my clearest accounting proffesor to this day. Pay attention to her powerpoints and go to class and you will do well! She gives clear notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2008<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, here's the deal with Du. I just took her class fall quarter 2007 at DePaul,and it was sad that DePaul actually hired her. She was late to EVERY class..she has a Chinese accent that is very difficult to understand..she stands up there and mumbles. her tests are all multiple choice with two &quot;big&quot; problems at the end. YOU WILL REGRET THIS CLASS!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2007<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did all the homework, class work, and went to every class. I didn't pass.   Her class is misleading because you feel as though you understand/doing well and then you take the test and it's nothing like we did in class. I would not take her unless you had to. I gave her the benifit of the doubt because of her bad rating. I wouldn't suggest you mak</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2007<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DU take her.
