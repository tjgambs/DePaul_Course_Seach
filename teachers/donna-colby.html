This is the worst prof. I've ever had. She basically wants you to memorize the AP stylebook and gives quizzes that are harshly graded on it. Assignments were stupid and unhelpful. I learned nothing from this class and everyone hated her. If you have enrolled in her class drop it while you still can.</div></div></div></body></html>
