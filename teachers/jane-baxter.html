I am an A student and I am currently getting a C- in her class. Impossible grader, arrogant, and expects way too  much out of her ONLINE students. Impossible to get an A on anything. DO NOT TAKE.

No textbooks were required -- just readings online. Simply read, participate, and write well. People confuse her confidence for hubris, but she is insanely authentic and sweet. Talk to her and you will instantly make a marvelous friend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2014<br>Class Name: ANT206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whoa! Beware. Her writing is aggressive and she is not helpful at all. She's very condescending And takes pride in her credentials- which is not a problem if you're actually helping your students get to that point. Very rude and confrontational. Drop her class immediately.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Baxter was really cool and knows a ton about all of the houses and neighborhoods that you your in This Old Chicago House. She even lives in one of them. She's a pretty easy and fair grader.

It is absolutely horrible. The work load is immense. She acts as if her class is the only one  that matters. You have to watch 5hrs or more of video and lectures per week, read LONG articles, and take impossible quizzes. Please spare yourself the trouble and find another history class to take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2013<br>Class Name: ANT206<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I adore Dr. Baxter but much like the poster below I have to say she is just not meant to teach online courses or intersessions. Even as an Ant major the course was hard for me and I was very familiar with 90% of the topics discussed. Inconsistent grading of the discussions as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2012<br>Class Name: ANT206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Baxter was chosen to teach the online intersesson class. The material was the same for a 10 week class but she added quizzes to make sure we actually listened to her lectures. Her condecending voice and Emails made the overly time consuming class close to impossible to complete. I would NEVER recommend her or this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had this professor for Discover This Old Chicago House- very interesting  person but way too self-absorbed and vain.

What is up with the good reviews&#63;  I took this class thinking it was going to be a great experience (thanks Rate My Professor!), but this prof is more about being the popular kid than being a good teacher.
