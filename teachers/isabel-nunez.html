She just read off her notes from the text throughout the quarter.  She does let you revise papers to improve on them.  Projects, I thought, were unclear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2005<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nunez is a very nice woman and a very intelligent person.  Her biggest flaw as a professor is her inability to keep the class interesting and introduce the material in a thought-provoking and entertaining format.  She's a pretty easy teacher, not hard to get an A in the class.  Many chances to revise papers for higher grade- take advantage of this.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2005<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very passionate and knowledgeable.  Prefers lecture format which is not necessarily an evil thing. She has a lot of information to impart and she does it, which I appreciated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: SCU337<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!!

If you do take her classes, you will feel like you are back in second grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2005<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She made this class sooooo easy.  It was an easy A!  A little boring at times, but whose to complain when you can get an easy A to boost up or keep up your GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: SCU339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not going to lie, this woman is so nice she really is but the class is so boring.  I had decent people in my class to make it a little bit more bearable but I would always have to leave early! No final/midterm/tests/quizzes any of that just a few papers that we're REALLY easy.  I would recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Possibly the most boring prof. at DePaul. Attendance counts which is horrible because the class is like having a root canal.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class. Weekly response papers. No final paper or exam. Weekly discussions. She is very flexible and bright.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2005<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A GREAT professor. Very nice woman and easy classes. I've taken her a couple times. Classes based almost completely on conversation so PLEASE participate or you'll die of boredom. No final or mid-term- only papers or short assignments. Is a tougher grader than you'd think , so use quality work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2005<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Creative assignments make boring topics (not her fault) more bearable. Ability to revise work for a better grade (she gives excellent feedback). Good at facilitating discussions, but needs some work on better integrating lectures into the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2005<br>Class Name: SCU337<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is the most boring teacher i have ever had in my life.  she read off her notes the entire class and there was barely any discussion at all; it was just her basically reading the chapters to us.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2005<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2005<br>Class Name: SCU337<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a nice woman! She assigned 5 papers, and she lets you get very creative in your responses and doesn't care if you use a different format if you talk with her about it (ie... ppt).  No midterms or final, and she discusses all of the readings in class.  Very lax with page limits too! Take her!</div></div></div></body></html>
