He is such a wonderful teacher. If you need extra help, he will stay with you and explain things to you in many different ways until you understand them. He is one of those teachers that actually cares whether you are absorbing the material and understanding it. If you read the literature (which is quite a bit), there is really </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2006<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Clever, intellectually witty, and extremely skilled in teaching complex concepts.

His entire class is him talking. You must take notes from him talking, he writes very little on the board. He is very knowledgeable, relatable, and mellow.He talks about interesting studies, topics, and showed Seinfeld and Dave Chapelle, which actually tied into something we were learning really well. Take him if u can</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man was my favorite teacher during the quarter. He is so funny. I'm basically cracking up the entire class period. He really knows what he's talking about and makes sure give examples to make the material easy to understand.  There's a lot of reading in that class, but it's all interesting stuff. I highly recommend him. TAKE HIS CLASS!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool teacher, and very laid back. The essays are easy, as well as the quizzes and midterms. All you need to do is study the key terms, listen in class and take notes, and you should end up with a good grade. He is a very cool guy to talk too, and is pretty young so he's more interactive with the students. If your taking SOC 101, TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE BEST SOCIOLOGY TEACHER EVER!!!

Never did I think I would be interested in this type of class, but he taught it so well and I learned a tremendous amount. The class was not very sressfull because he has an understanding that we are college students with social lives.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An overall great guy, take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very into what he teaches and studies. He brings up random funny examples about his research in sociology, but what wierd that they all are relevent to the subjects in class.
