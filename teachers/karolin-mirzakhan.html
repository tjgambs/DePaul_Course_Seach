    Karolin is amazing. She makes the course relatable. There are short quizzes every day over the films and text. There were also four journals (single spaced 1pg paper on what u readsaw). I got to learn about philosophy, realize I love it, and see several films which I never would have. Definitely recommend. Participation matters.

    Karolin is a great teacher. I hated the content of this course and philosophy in general but she made it bearable because she is great at explaining the content of the readings. We have daily quizzes on the readings and 3 short writing assignments. I recommend meeting with her to go over your rough drafts for the writing assignments, no tests.

    Karolin was initially intimidating, but amazing. She is very clear about her expectations &amp; gave good lectures. She's big on participation and we had a quiz every class but as long as you read the material (which was never very long) and watched the movies, they were easy. One of my favorite professors at DePaul so far, definitely taking her again!

    Karolin is a fantastic professor and I really enjoyed her class!  It was extremely difficult to get a good grade if you don't participate in the class discussions.  The midterm &amp; final are both take-home and there is one group project.  She wants you to succeed and if you ask for her time she will give it to you.

    Take home midterm. Group project. Take home final. Go to class everyday, not because she takes attendance but because you have a quiz basically everyday. You'll need her lectures to understand the reading material anyway. Unless you're great at reading old English Aristotle books, then don't go to class, you seem to have everything under control.

    TAKE. HER. I was terrified of PHL and now I am just waiting to take another class with her. She is funny and is very clear with what she wants out of the 4, 2-page papers. She is great and I looked forward to class every day.

    Not bad but not good. I learned more from the readings she assigned than I did in class. The course was set up as one big seminar which wasn't very fun. I would not take this class again, but it's not a bad option.

    I have always disliked Philosophy courses but she managed to make this one very tolerable. Always goes over assigned readings in class since they are often hard to understand. Very helpful posts all readings on D2L so you dont need a book. A little heavy on readings but doable, &amp; quizzes are easy if you read. Midterm &amp; Final take home or open note.

    Karolin has a great personality. She goes over everything in class to make sure we understand the material. Her lectures are very interesting and they are made without traditional power point slides, so instead she makes diagrams or give us real examples we can relate to. I learned a lot in class and she is a fair grader. Highly recommend her!

    Karolin is a great professor! If you take her for ethics, expect lots of readings- but she goes out of her way to make sure students understand the readings. Quizzes are easy points if you do the readings/understand them. Class is engaging and worthwhile. She's down to earth and really makes learning fun.

    Karolin is really great. She's really nice and funny. She has one page papers due for each reading. Very easy grading scale. No midterm or final just paper about your favorite artwork. She gives extra credit for presenting on a piece of art that relates to class. DEF RECOMMENDED!!!

    She kept the class really interesting and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. She was very helpful in making sure you understood the material, both inside the classroom and out. No tests, just papers, and the focus was on art. Definitely take her class if you can! Plus she's pretty young, so she totally understands a student's standpoint.

    This class was extremely interesting. Everyone always wanted to participate for the most part. This class focuses on art, ex graffiti. The lectures helped understand the difficult readings. If everyone in class prints out the reading, then there is NO quiz :).
