Around 70 pages of reading a week, but half way into the term, everyone realizes there are no pop quizzes. One final paper along with a group project that isn't particularly a group project; more of a group presentation about your own research paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: PSC235<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There were short readings for every class and 3 papers including the final. He explained all the reading thoroughly and sets you up to be able to write all the papers. This is the second time I've taken a class with him and I'd be willing to take another. He grades fairly and always gives feedback.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2014<br>Class Name: PSC235<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken two classes with professor French and I really like him.  Most poli-sci professors are very outspoken about being liberal, and are bias.  But, Professor French is very fair, and his lectures are very clear and well thought out.  He makes the material easy to understand.  Just readings for HW, two 5-7 pg papers and a final exam.  TAKE!</div></div></div></body></html>
