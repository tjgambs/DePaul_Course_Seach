He really shows an appreciation for what he teaches and cares about his students. He makes it really easy to participate in class and his assignments are easy. I usually don't participate in classes, but i actually wanted to participate in his. Con- there was a lot of reading, but we didnt always go over the readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE THE DISCOVER MARATHON COURSE! The majority of freshman that take this class are cool so you will meet friends right away. The class has a couple papers but he is an easy grader, he assigns readings but hardly ever gets to them so the book which i got off Amazon for $4 total, wasn't really necessary. This class is really worth taking!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2010<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT teacher! made discover so much more interesting and has connections with chicago marathon people so you get to experience a lot and learn much more.
