    This teacher is very hard. She will loose it in class b/c you haven't done your work. DO NOT DISAGREE with her, she will hunt you down. She is not good at explaining and gives a lot of reading. Be prepared to kiss ass ( she is especially tolerant if u do)

    She has no self confidence, which results in her inability to teach well. She takes students' critical statements as a personal offense. She will freak out in class and kick the entire class out. If you disagree with her, she will hold it against you.
