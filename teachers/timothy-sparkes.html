He's a smart guy, a nice guy, but an abysmal teacher! You leave lecture thinking you've got this, then you see his homework, tests, and quizzes and they're not even close to in-class material. Doesn't use the book and he uses his own terminology so there's no way you can verify what he's saying from an outside source.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2015<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>just take him. he talks a little bit fast, goes very fast on lectures but just ask him again, he'll repeat it for you. very intelligent and funny. bio is not easy. its usually not the professor, it's you. you don't only rely on the professor, you gotta keep reading and studying to get an A in this class, I got a B which was okay.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2014<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an alright teacher. Really enjoys and is interested in what he teaches his students. However, he does go through material really fast and it is hard to understand him at times. He also doesn't use lecture slides. He is willing to help his students. You need to go to class because very little of his lectures correspond to the text.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: BIO193<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sparkes is so great!

He makes sure he encourages his students to succeed and that they understand the material completely. He gets strict during his test policies, but rightly does it. Outside of class, he always stops by and greets you. The lecture hall is huge, and doesnt require attendence. All his tests are note based and no textbook req</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2013<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. He does an amazing job of using concepts taught during lecture and applying them to greater scenarios. He makes you think and work in class, which ultimately instills the proper thought process for the exams. Little textbook use, which was actually a good thing for the subject of the class. Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2012<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sparkes is the man!  He is the easiest teacher to converse with, and he genuinely knows the material he teaches.  He is as funny as any teacher I've had at the University, and he is willing to spend all the time it takes to make sure his students understand the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just took my final exam, and after the exam I was sitting in the pit and Dr. Sparkes came over and talked to my friend and I.  He's the ideal professor.    Not only will I retain the information I learned this quarter, but I am also interested more in ecology and evolution because of Dr. Sparkes.  He was helpful and explained things very well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2012<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sparkes is incredibly engaging. He has a unique accent and speaks rather quickly, but he is clear to understand. He is helpful, funny, and if you go to class, it shouldn't be hard to get the grade you want! Attendance isn't mandatory, but he DEFINATELY knows when you're not there. He doesn't use the textbook, but it is a very helpful aid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2011<br>Class Name: BIO118<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for summer class and was extremely clear and helpful. Easy A if you take diligent notes and pay attention in class. Group activities are involving and keeps the class exciting. No text book but read the articles he assigns. Study guides clear.

Very motivating. However, he does not use the book AT ALL, so the midterms and final exam are all from lecture. This can be a problem for some students (myself included) and I don't really like ecology and evolution, but you get the hang of it. Definitely take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DrSparkes is a great teach in my opinion. Does not teach from the book at all, which can be a problem for some.But if you attend his lectures he writes the exams pretty much from that.Some of the questions are pretty tricky but it is not hard to do well in there.There are 2 exams and a final exam and all are multiple choice.works toward your future</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2007<br>Class Name: BIO118<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a great guy, really a fun class! there are 3 tests that arnt that bad all m/c.

Not always the best for some students.  I found his exams almost impossible, takes lots of studying if you want to pass.  P.S. If you haven't taken calculus, some of the math is hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2007<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you have to take Bio 102, take him!

He is an excellent professor and a lot of fun. I love his English accent, although sometimes it's hard to understand him. He is very friendly and helpful.

He tries his best and will help you whenever you need it but he never tell you the answer best he wants you to figure it out on your own. I recommend taking him. CONS: Talks REALLY fast with ENGLISH accent makes him hard to understand. TERRIBLE handwriting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: BIO118<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome class!!

He is really kind and understanding</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2004<br>Class Name: MARINEBIO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sparkes is awesome. He's so cool and so nice. He rarely gives HW and if u take the notes he gives in class and review them for the tests, they are no prob. For a science elective I would highly recommend taking this class, especially if u despise science such as myself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2004<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sparkes is such an AWESOME professor!  Take him if you get the chance to do so!  He's really knowlegeable about Biology in general, and always tries to make the class fun!  Take him!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2004<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher!
