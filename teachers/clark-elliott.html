He's nice enough when he's not threatening the class, which was incessant, but the problem is that the lectures just aren't very good, and they often don't have anything to do with the assignments, which are the only interesting part.  My only takeaway is multithreading in java.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: CSC435<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I worked hard! Great class. I learned a lot. Really makes you think. Elliott has extreme knowledge of the material. Programming assignments were very useful and very comprehensive. I loved his entertaining lectures. He knew everyone's name by week two. Newsgroup forums really helpful for me, but it took a while to get used to posting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2014<br>Class Name: CSC435<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So much work but will absolutely stab you in the back when he assigns grades.  I don't think he enjoys teaching because the class taught ourselves the material.  He's never at his office hours and when you have questions he asks you to post it on a forum.  A complete waste of money and time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2014<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love him. He says do "good work" which some may hate, but  it's basically put as much effort as you want into the class and understand what you can. He emphasizes discussions heavily, but I enjoyed having them online because not everything can be covered in class. He is definitely one of my favorite professors so far.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2014<br>Class Name: CSC435<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>I've had some bad professors at DePaul in the past but Clark is by far the worst.  He doesn't seem to care about the quality of his lectures.  He is often times late and is completely disorganized with respect to the content of his lectures.  The other reviews are pretty accurate.  Nice guy but a terrible teacher.  Avoid if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is easy depending on prior knowledge. I knew nothing and was lost a lot of the time. I pulled through with an A because I put in effort, but at the beginning, I struggled. He is a great guy, super nice and funny and intelligent. But he is very unorganized. This is not a blow off class, but it is very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: CSC435<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had some bad profs at DePaul in the past.  Elliot is the worst.  Doesn't have the ability to teach effectively.  Instructions for assignments are difficult to follow.  Take my advice and try to avoid him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: CSC435<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy but god awful educator.  Downplays how hard his assignments are and when you have questions or need help...he refers you to an online forum.  He preaches how much he wants his students to learn but doesnt know how to teach!  Im at a lost as too why DePaul let's him stay.  Avoid him if you can but I think he teaches all the CSC 435 classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2013<br>Class Name: CSC435<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just avoid the class if you can.Makes you post on forum,Makes you create lengthy study log,tons of assignment, midterm+final, makes you work hard on everything and you get a  "C"</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2013<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was my worst academic experiences at DePaul. Unrealistic expectations discussion board participation (30+ weekly posts). Instructions for his written exams are dispersed among 6 different documents because he is too lazy to draft up something for his current class. Very narrow minded. Avoid at all cost</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2012<br>Class Name: CSC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I was skeptic about the class, but this was an EXCELLENT professor. I am a junior and this was the best class I have ever taken. This professor actually cares about the class and waist no time. He cares about the students and makes sure you learn alot before the semester ends! I recommend this professor to EVERYONE! TRUST ME. great class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: ECT425<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a person that has been in the &quot;real world&quot; for awhile, I found his &quot;surmons&quot; on real world situations to be of very little value. I also found it quite amusing that he made us post in a online forum because &quot;verbal communication is essential in the workplace&quot;. How does posting in a online forum behind a screen name help our verbal communication&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: ECT425<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned in this class, but I didn't get the grade that I should of got. I'm sure I would of got an A if a different Professor taught this course. His grading scale is based mostly on the exams, and the exams were hard because matching concepts with definitions is time consuming. This is the only class I have the lowest grade on so far at Depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2006<br>Class Name: CSC394<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good guy.  Being in the &quot;real world&quot; I appreciated his candor and understand his view.  He's just making sure you understand where you are going. The projects are tough, deadlines crazy, but if you work hard - he won't kill you over it. (Well, just make sure all projects WORK - even if they HAVE to be ridiculously simple.)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2005<br>Class Name: CSC394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. His class does a great job of simulating what things are like in the real world when working with a team to develop a software product under tough deadlines. The class isn't easy, but it isn't supposed to be.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2005<br>Class Name: FINALYRPROJECT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very harsh proff.seems like a great guy but trust me he'll screw you in the end.he wont trust you no matter what.He needs to take a vacation.he thinks he can teach but sorry to say he sucks at it.if you are good asskisser then you might do good otherwise Fail</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2004<br>Class Name: CSC394<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He dosen't know how to teach! He just wants &quot;good work.&quot; He'll go over the same subject over and over again. However, if he likes your group from the get go, you should have no problem. (Make sure not to use the word &quot;basically&quot;!!)</div></div></div></body></html>
