She is THE BEST. She is VERY knowledgable on Latin American Art, and art in general. She is a stickler for being on time, and attendance, but I think that's just because when people walk in late she loses her train of thought. Lots of EC options, very helpful, very sweet, take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2013<br>Class Name: HAA145<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher who's very into her topic and teaching. Makes art history easy and very interesting to follow. definetely recommend her. But be prepared to do quite a lot of memorization. It is an art history class, so it is expected.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2013<br>Class Name: HAA246<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Professor, very solid.

She really has a way of grasping the students attention! Readings are a requirement but over all the class goes by fast. She's super helpful outside of the classroom and will give extra credit. Test are not that bad, however you do need to memorize dates to paintings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2012<br>Class Name: LST248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Holian is a very helpful teacher. She is very passionate of her subject. Very clear in class and loves to involve all of her students in discussions. One of the best teachers I've had at DePaul. Class is a bit difficult, lots of reading and discussions; but if you read, easy A! I highly recommend to take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2012<br>Class Name: HAA247<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms Holian is a great teacher, and she is also a super nice person.Her classes are not hard at all.She makes it easy to get a good grade if you put in the work.I got and A on her classes and used to have a nice relationship with her,but for some reason she stopped liking me :( not sure what I did to offend her.I still think she is great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2011<br>Class Name: HAA247<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite teachers I have had at DePaul. She lectures quite a lot, but if you pay attention, it can be really interesting. She is a bit dorky, but very straight forward and explains everything with complete clarity. I would definitely take another course she teaches again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: HAA246<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this art history class as a requirement for my art credits; STAY AWAY. Way easier classes to fill requirement. Midterm, Final, Final Essay, and Critical Analysis of an artwork. Expects us to be art experts for the paper and makes you memorize names, dates, & titles of artworks for final & midterm. Studied 80 slides & only tested us on 35 -__-</div></div></div></body></html>
