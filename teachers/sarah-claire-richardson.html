You have to teach yourself statistics if your don't know any already. She never grades fairly and gives multiple hours of homework for each assignment with problems she never even talks about or goes over. Do not take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2014<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the worst professor I've ever had. I came in thinking that this class would decent and give me a good grade but she made me panic so much about my grade. The amount of homework is ridiculous. She weighted the homework so much more than the midterm, final, and presentation. I would go for help and I walked out even more confused.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2014<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will have to teach yourself everything. This was one of the most confusing classes I've ever taken - many hours of homework each week. Lectures are mandatory even though you end up just having to watch Khan Academy/get a tutor anyway.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2014<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take her!! She uses a different book than other professors and admits that it doesn't explain things well. You have to teach yourself  everything and even if you go in for help she is confusing. This class is giving me more anxiety than 300 level science courses and was supposed to be easy. Stay away if possible!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2014<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I know this is a required class for bio/health sciences, but really try to avoid this prof. if you can. She is so unclear in class and gets things wrong all the time so you get more confused. She doesn't teach what the homework assignments are on, so you basically have to teach yourself from the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2011<br>Class Name: HON180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Richardson keeps it real. She doesn't make things unnecessarily hard, even if she herself does get a little bit confused. I'd recommend taking her class if you don't like math, or aren't good at it but have to take it. Plus, it's great to see her workin' her turtle neck every day! Nice lady.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable.  Go in for help if you need it, she will help you.  There is group work and group presentation.  Tests are straightforward.  No pop quizzes.  Just wants you to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Richardson is a nice and relatively good professor. You can tell she tries really hard to be a really great professor. The class lectures were sort of boring. There were a few  short assignments. Easy midterm and final. Also there was a group presentation project that was easy... if you got people in your group who helped.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2009<br>Class Name: HON180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes an intimidating subject like stats seem more approachable to nonmath majors. Sooo sweet and understanding! Grade comprised of homework assignments that're due each class (involves analytical writing but few actual math problems to solve) plus some group projects. Fun and easygoing class. You won't regret taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2008<br>Class Name: HON180<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very caring! She was goofy and fun and definitely does not have a malicious bone in her body. I am entirely not a math person, so this class was made for me in that it wasn't overly challenging, included a lot of practice and fostered a relaxing atmosphere. Not always clear, but who cares&#63; She's smart and eccentric and terrific! Got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2008<br>Class Name: HON180<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her statistics class can be very confusing to someone that has never taken a formal statistics class before. However, if you have taken stats before, you will find this class extremely easy. She's not a great communicator, but she is nice and trys to be helpful, although most of the time the help proves ineffective.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: HON180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really makes class fun...she isnt good at explaining stats but thats fien for the class cause you dont realy have to understand the math of it. lets you do cool experiments and is really relaxed about grading/handing things in! i love her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2006<br>Class Name: ECOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the definition of a swetheart! she is kind of unclear in class, but helpful if you need it. Her tests are worht alot and kind of difficult, and she gives pop quizzes(5 or so worth 10pts). However, lab is easy and fun and you reciece alot of points to make up for missed quizzes.  Read the night before class and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so enthusiastic about the subject in a cute nerdy way, will explain the topic as much as you need. quizzes are easy if you've read the assignments. book was on reserve in the library (or else it costs $90!) lots of guest speakers. the final exam was on overall understanding and analyzation and not too much on memorization</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2006<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An unassuming, non-threatening, laid back professor.  I didn't even realize I was learning while I was in the class because everything was so not intense but looking back it was definitely a valuable course.  She's deeply nerdy but in an endearing sort of way.</div></div></div></body></html>
