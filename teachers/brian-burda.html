He makes the class extremely easy, you don't even need the book. All he does is give the exams before hand and you memorize the answers. This class is an easy A and I would definitely take another Finance class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It really doesn't get much easier than this. He gives 2 quizes (100 questions each) and midterm and final which are 200 Q's. All Multiple choice and he gives you the carbon copy of the Q's and A's which he scrambles so all you have to do is memorize them. Can be alot to remember so you still need to study. Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: FIN335<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EASIEST professor for portfolio management. Didn't learn a thing (mostly because I only went to 2 class sessions) but students that went every week didn't learn anything as well. Only graded on the final presentation which takes effort but still easy and ended up with an A! No textbook needed and he posts all the notes online.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2009<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy and great professor, people say you dont learn anything but i believe you are introduced to things but do not thoroughly learn them. Answers are given for all quizes/exams but its scrambled so memorize. Supercool guy very understanding with things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2009<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If all you're looking to get is an easy A, take Burda. Warning: you will learn NOTHING from him. Class consists of 2 quizzes (100 questions), midterm (200 questions), final (200 question). If you can memorize answers to 200 questions, you're all set. DO NOT BUY THE BOOK, he doesn't use it. Pads the GPA, but other than that it's useless.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2009<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Two 100 multiple choice quizzes and midterm and final both 200 multiple choice questions. A copy of questions on all exams are given a week before. You can get away with not going to any classes, simply memorizing the exam questions and attending to take them. Do NOT buy book. Easy A, just memorization is key</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2009<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is honestly the worst professor I've ever had. All he does is waste time by telling stories about himself, coworkers, family and whatnot, and then barely skims through the slides because we're out of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2009<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a bad work load, lots of memorization, but a good class. Awesome guy, period.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2009<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will learn absolutely nothing from this class. He seems like a smart guy but DOESN'T know how to teach. If you want an easy class take him, keep in mind that you will get nothing out of the class though. I don't feel prepared for Fin 333 at all!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2009<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down amazing professor. He actually cares about all of his students performance, unlike other F*(&^( professors. FIN 330 can be such a challenging class and he makes it worth your while. TAKE BURDA!!!!! YOU WILL ENJOY THIS CLASS!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
