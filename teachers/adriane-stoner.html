She uses relevant, modern day examples to further explain the topics. I laughed out loud in every class, my friends even compare her to Tina Fey. She assigns weekly reading from the text book and only gives 2 essays, a midterm, and a final. If you need to take COM101, take it with Stoner!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2015<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE HER SO MUCH!!! I would take my discover class all over again if I could. She always brought life into the class. She's funny, smart, helpful, and overall a fantastic professor. Most of our homework was common hour (taught by other two assistants) but she only gave us one Discussion question to do each week (it's easy if you do it right).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2015<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She's hilarious and the lectures were always interesting and very personal!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2015<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!

Her lectures are great and she makes class really fun. It is a lecture so there are only 4 grades, two papers a midterm and a final. The textbook really helps in understanding the material. Show up or you won't pass. She is very helpful and will adjust office hours to meet demand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2015<br>Class Name: RELC340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Stoner is awesome. She's sort of hard to read at first but don't be fooledshe's really really nice and funny, especially if you take more than one class with her. She super clear about what she wants. Do the work and you'll be fine. The work is interesting and relevant. Definitely take her if you can</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2015<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. She actually relates the course material to fun examples with movie clips, tv episodes, etc. Even with a class of 100+, she does well with having the whole class participate and keeping everyone engaged. However, she is a tough grader and only a handful of people get As (as stated herself).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2015<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class wasn't to bad, everything that is expected of you is clearly stated.

Her lectures are interesting, and she knows how to get students to participate in class discussions. She is very helpful when writing papers. Definitely do all of the readings, as most of her upper-level classes are reading intensive. I recommend her to all communication students. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2015<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Stoner is hilarious. Plus, her lectures are always super interesting. I never found myself bored in her class and was able to absorb the information really well. I definitely recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2015<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher at Depaul, she really has great lectures prepared and engages the class extremely well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2015<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a good teacher. She's funny and I actually looked forward to going to lectures. She relates to students in a good way and she's understanding. Make sure you go get help in her office every now and then - she gives good advice for papers - overall a good experience in her class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2015<br>Class Name: RELC311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Adrian is so nice! She always keeps her lectures interesting. This class is very insightful, and relevant. She creates a great environment to learn in, and is easy to talk to. I plan on taking her again this quarter.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2014<br>Class Name: 101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was super helpful if you went to her office hours. She's always quick to email back. And the lectures were interesting. She shows a lot of clips which are good to break up the class. She's very organized. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: RELC311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Adriane is my favorite professor at DePaul.  She keeps your attention and is the perfect combination of strict and entertaining.  If you do the work for the class and show up you will get a relatively good grade (provided you're not a terrible writer).  I would HIGHLY recommend taking any class from her! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Participation is not mandatory- but if you show up, there is no reason you should walk out of the class with an A or B. Midterm and Final Exam, and two papers are the only grades in the class. She is witty and applies examples to everyday life. I took it as an elective.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: 101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are two exams (mid-term and final) which are both only multiple choices so if you won't skip the class, exams are very easy. Two paper are about the analysis of a movie and case study based on concepts you learn in the class. My score was not so good but she gives extra office hour for paper so you feel better if you take such advantages.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2014<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Stoner explains the material well in lecture and always says things like "this will be on the midterm" or "you'll need this for your paper". Paying attention in class, taking good notes and going over the chapter outlines in the book is enough for a solid B+. Easy A if you put in more effort. Graded on 2 5-page papers, a midterm, and a final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Straight up professor. She's funny and makes class interesting when the topic can seem somewhat common sense. I recommend going to each class even though it's not mandatory because it can be easy to get off track with the class. Go to her office with the papers, it helps a lot because she can be a tough grader on those.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>CMN 101 is one of those classes that are giant and it seems evreyone has to take it. That being said, Adriane was a decent professor. She is kind of rude at times and is not always super clear when it comes to grading criteria for her papers. Read the book and go to class and you should be fine. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2014<br>Class Name: RELC311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows what she's talking about and makes class interesting. There's a lot of reading, but it's all relevant to our social media use and changes your perspective. Plus, they aren't difficult readings. Class discussions are awesome and the assignments are sparse and easy. Take her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2014<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an amazing proffesor! Two papers, a midterm and a final. She covers almost half the chapter in class and you have to read the other half on your own. The book is really easy though. Tests are so easy, you just have to know the terms. She is young and funny and her lectures are amazing. TAKE HER!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2014<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Adriane Stoner was a great professor. You can tell she loves the material that she is teaching and she wants us to get excited about it too.  Her tests are half based on the book and half based on the lecture notes, and she'll offer to read over papers for you too! As a communications major, I found myself excited to go to her class. Take her! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Stoner is an amazing professor. She is really funny and is always available to help outside of class. If you attend every class and take notes, the midterm and final are a piece of cake. I enjoyed her class even though I am not a communications major. Definitely take her. You wont regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2014<br>Class Name: COMM101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>She is an amazing college professor-the kind you epitomize one to be. I found her class to be fairly easy as she keeps all her expectations spellt out and crystal clear. She demands respect, especially in a lecture with 100+ people (this is totall acceptable and understandable). Make sure you fully understand her expectations and you'll get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2014<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Take Stoner for Com 101! She is funny, uses relevant examples, and makes the class fun. Everyone in my class loved her. It is a lecture class, sometimes having over 100 students, but she makes everyone interested and engaged. 2 papers, a midterm and a final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2014<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my first lecture class taken at DePaul. She was very nice and was honest about the subject matter we were learning, and also was well prepared for each class.

She makes the lessons very interesting and funny with her hilariously sarcastic sense of humor. She's by far the best teacher I've had at DePaul so far. If you try, her class shouldn't be hard. I regret not choosing her for my COM102 class so much it's not even funny. You WILL enjoy her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>As a random elective for a non-communications major, this class was interesting. There were many videos (i.e.: South Park) and interesting topics. Our grades did consist of only four grades, so if you did poor on one assignment you couldn't get an A. The tests were easy, but she is picky about papers (she'll offer to read over your drafts; do it).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: RELC311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED Adriane for com 101 and 102, but this class is just alright.

It's awesome. There's only 2 papers and 2 tests (a midterm and a final). Both aren't super difficult, but make sure you study. She doesn't offer extra credit so this is all your grade is based on. Buy the book! 50% of the tests are based off it. She doesn't take attendance, but I actually enjoyed going :) .</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2013<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Stoner is a funny professor that gives a lot of great examples in class. While getting help from her is kind of hard she does try to help you when she can.  The class only consists of 4 assignments, a midterm, a final, and 2 papers.  While none of them were hard it is still important that you do all the work or your grade will suffer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is awesome, her examples in class are relevant and funny.
