If you are struggling, or having problems in a group project contact him. He will take care of you if you put the effort in but he will let you fail if you don't try.  Come prepared to work. He's a nice guy if you can handle a little ribbing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2015<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not the best professor I've taken but if theres no other like I had then you should be fine. His lectures are long and boring and he likes to voice his opinion about things in class. outside of class hes a really cool guy but you have to make sure you turn in all of the assignments since theres only 5 he grades. you wont pass if you dont do them</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2014<br>Class Name: GAM245<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher; only gives you the grade you deserved. However, he expects a lot of work in a short amount of time. It is smart to start your assignments right away when he gives them or else you'll be spending many nights awake.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy; easy to get ahold of. He's very nice but a very fair and firm grader. He finds the glaring problems in your games that you didn't look hard enough for. Fellow students found him "intimidating" but he's really just a teddybear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2014<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he likes to talk alot and says some interesting things but if you ask a "stupid" question he will seem to think less of you and be annoyed with what you are asking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2013<br>Class Name: GAM245<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For non-programmers, its difficult. I recommend working on the assignments way ahead of time & do not become overambitious w/ game ideas for the last 2 assignments (have planning doc fleshed out w/ every input or else!); its not recommended unless you have very good knowledge of C# & can take advantage of a severely, limited, custom game engine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a pretty decent guy and likes to talk. There will be sometimes where what he says might come off as a bit rude, but he doesn't mean it in that way. He answers emails in minutes & just really wants you to take the class seriously. A lot of work! Grading is pretty fair and easy as long as you actually do the assignment and follow the rubric. :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2013<br>Class Name: GAM245<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows what he is teaching and makes great powerpoints that you can easily follow for help on the assignments. His grading is extremely difficult to nail - you must show effort in your assignments and do the work. He'll sometimes take off for various things, but as long as you do what is on the rubric and show you tried, then he gives good grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2013<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Andre is a pretty cool dude. Where he sucks at knowing names and faces (especially when it comes to emails) he is always willing to help a student out. The class overall He covers a LOT of information per class, can be overwhelming, you can space out easily, and he doesn't really cover EVERYTHING you'll need for a project. Requires lots of times</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2011<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Andre rarely treated students with any semblance of respect. There was absolutely no consistency between grades. He NEVER said anything positive, and during class presentations beat even the most exemplary students into the ground. His condescending nature is not  conductive to learning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2011<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is helpful and very quick to respond to emails, although he isn't always a bundle of laughs when he does contact you. Can be tough and also focuses on the things you screwed up and not the things you did right. In the end I learned what I was supposed to, and he taught the material well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2008<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love his accent.  He does talk a mile a minute, so you can't space out for any of his lectures.  Incredibly quick in responding to email.  Knows and loves his subject.  Lays down the law in terms of assignments in the beginning so you know where you stand.  If you're looking for someone to challenge you, he's your man.  Easy &quot;A&quot;, not likely.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although you will have a large work load, if you at least complete the assignments you will get a good grade.  He is a very fair grade.  I received a 79 and 77 on 2 of the 5 assignments and still got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2008<br>Class Name: GM244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked Andre, but I barely learned a thing from going to his class.  He talks at a fast pace NONSTOP for the entire class.  If you can learn in that kind of class, take him, if you can't, think twice.  Honestly though, he's pretty helpful and understanding of anything that goes wrong/you need help with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2007<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When teaching, Andre is to-the-point and won't dance around the issues. He's very accessible and is glad to help you fix problems with code. Attendance is mostly optional, but I'd recommend it. If you do ALL of the assignments in this class (especially the major ones), you'll do fine. He even warns you that this is the case, so take him seriously!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2006<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty decent teacher. Has a short fuse. Makes a bigger deal about the game design document rather then the game itself (lame). For the final project, he grades it on negatives (how many bugs/errors) rather then positives (quality of work/detail/overall fun). So dont add special effects, just make sure to hand in a completed game with no bugs!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2006<br>Class Name: 491<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>None</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows what he is talking about and is very clear. He teaches as if no one has had coding experience, but in the end, if you don't have any you may still have difficulty understanding some of it. Very helpful, he always responds to e-mails right away and helps troubleshoot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the first time I had him for my classes.  He explaines everything really well and helpes anyone when neccesary.  His grading on the other hand is a little hard.  But if you do well in the class and do what he likes you to do you will defintley get a good grade for the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher! There were 4 projects in the class total, I missed the first two and I got a 65 on the third project... He was really pissed off when I asked what can be done, but he told me to do a REALLY good job on project 3 again and do OUTSTANDING On project 4 and he'll pass me, I did both and he passed me!  Very forgiving, very heplful! A++++</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: GAM244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this is a great class, he tries to cater to those who have no coding experiance, but the class may be hard unless you had atleast one coding class. Andre is a really cool guy, the best thing about him is hes ALWAYS available for help, I emailed him many of time and he always responds at the latest 30 min.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2005<br>Class Name: CSC491<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor.  Very enthusiastic, very energetic, very clear.  Good sense of humor, too.  Clearly enjoys teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2005<br>Class Name: CSC416<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intense teacher: tough material, tough grading, resulting in good material understanding.  Don't take if you want an easy class.  Clear voice (with a pleasant Quebec accent ;)</div></div></div></body></html>
