He's really interested in this subject and you can tell he honestly just wants you to be too. There is a lot of reading that I would highly suggest you do if you want a good grade and a lot of note taking. Overall I learned so much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was so bored in this class and it was filled with so much reading that I thought was unnecessary and the quizzes were tests.

Attending the class is not mandatory but if you take it make sure to go to every class and take notes because he doesn't repeat himself and things he talks about only in class are on the tests. Make sure to study before a lot before the tests, they are hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: HIST183SEC202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quizes are closer to exams.  You use a blue book, scantron and write on the test.  He won't warn you before the first quiz either... His final exam is ridiculous.

Lectures are never boring; there's a lot of reading but no more than what you'd expect from a history class. The discussions tend to be fairly lively: having students interested in the material helps. Can be a bit unorganized but knows and is passionate about the material. Above average professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/18/2011<br>Class Name: HIST210A<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is the WORST.

So far, he seems 2 be worrying me a lot and as I learn more about his teaching and exam methods I'm becoming more fearful. A LOT of material to read and cover, and in his lectures he is like the flying paper all over the place. Also, extremely mind-numbing class. I fell a sleep and lost interest on </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2010<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is very boring. The powerpoints are dry and he goes too fast, allowing no time to write down anything. He assigns a large amount a reading per night. The only positive thing I have to say about him is that he is a fairly easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2010<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a person, this man is a hard worker. However, his teaching isn't the greatest. Class structure: Stresses group work (once a week), mandatory attendance, quiz every 2 weeks (mult. choice, short answer), 5-7 page final paper. The class is boring, but it's a requirement. If you hate group work, do NOT take this class. Believe me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2009<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not THAT bad. Although most kids take this class b/c it's a fulfills a requirement and he expects a little too much...he has good intentions. If you read just the online summaries you will be fine. Answer his questions in class b/c it will be silent until someone does. He is excited about history and wants you to be too. He's just average</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: HST254<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>&quot;Let's just put it this way.&quot;I didn't know American Urban History could be so uninteresting. Lectures are long and tedious; he spends way too much time on colonial America. &quot;I guess is a way of putting it.&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2009<br>Class Name: HST384<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horribly boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2008<br>Class Name: HIST254<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2008<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring and does nothing to change it.  I remember when he literally let the class sit in silence because people were too bored to answer him.  He will make you want to fall asleep, and as far as assignments, he basically assigns busy work for a 200 level class in college. He is so uptight about the class its not even funny. DO NOT TAKE HIM</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2007<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A horrible college professor, should be high school history teacher. As a history major, and a senior, I can definetly say he was one of the worst HST profs I've taken: multiple choice tests, constant lecture, and the lectures and tests are on inane historical information. I barely learned anything and I feel robbed of an education. DO NOT TAKE HIM</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2007<br>Class Name: HST254<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I must also defend this teacher, to me this class was not as bad as some ppl made it seem.  There is allot of reading but you can also get away with not reading, he doesnt force you to participate but would like if you did.  The midterm and the final are the same, just know facts, and you'll never write more than 1000 words, which makes the class e</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: HST254<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>honestly, i try to be fair and give all my professors a good chance but this man just drove me nuts. i know this is college and we are supposed to read a lot but to read so much and then hardly use it in class was just a waste of my time...only good thing is he is a fairly easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: HIST281<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He takes a long time to say what he means and basically leaves the class to teach themselves</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2006<br>Class Name: HST281<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>topics and notes all over the place. random quizes if no one reads, really boring, monotone voice, class was ok definately not him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2006<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is an EASY class if you do the work and come prepared to discuss the primary documents.  The quizzes are easy (if the reading has been done) and the midterm and final are difficult, but not impossible if you study and come prepared to take them.  Overall, an easy class for those willing to work for their grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2006<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I must admit that I, too, was nervous after reading all the reviews but I found him to be a throughly charming, intelligent and engaging instuctor. Keep up to date with the readings, especially the primary documents. Do that and you'll do fine!  He doesn't &quot;hate everyone&quot;, he respects hard-working, intelligent students.  And he does remember names!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2006<br>Class Name: HIST282<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was nervous to take this class after I read these reviews but I soon found them completely untrue.  He is a good teacher- sometimes gets confused- but he teaches the subject matter well.  The assignments are straight forward and very do-able.  If you go to class and read, which you should be doing anyway, you will be FINE! I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2006<br>Class Name: HISTORY282<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I honestly don't know what everyone is talking about.  He is not only adorable (so Nantucket preppy) but a clear teacher.  As long as you read you'll be fine. I love him! And he supplied my class with midterm study tips, so those who complained about no study guide are mistaken. Love love him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2006<br>Class Name: HISTORY270<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NEVER take a class with this guy.Trust me if you ask a question you will most likely get this response, &quot;um....well...good question..i dont know&quot;, or &quot;we'll talk about that later i guess&quot;..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: HISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Let it be known that I hate history, so no matter who taught it, I was going to be bored anyway...that said, I dont know what these people are talking about!! This dude was cool as hell...he gave us study guides for the midterm and gave us the essay questions for the final in adavance.

I had him for an 8:30 class and it got to the point where I was physically falling asleep in class, which i have never done.  Also, I thought I knew more then him with certian topics which wasn't the best...He doesn't have favorites, he just hates everyone!! and i agree with everyone else.  he will never know your name!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy was a pain in the  a** the first few weeks and was unclear about assignments.

He gives no study guide and tests you on an enclycopedia of notes. You could sit in the first row of his class an entire quarter and this guy would never know your name. This guy could care less if a student does well in his class. Do yourself a favor, save your money and AVOID THIS TEACHER AT ALL COSTS!!

He is boring, monotone, never looks at the students, only lectures about government, tests are very hard and so are the quizzes. the only good thing i could say is that i asked for help and he seemed he cared....but i wouldnt take him for another class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2005<br>Class Name: HIS281<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this class!  He is so boring and unclear about everything.  He talks to himself all the time and never even looks up at his students.  No student has even spoken the entire quarter.

He bores the class into submission as not one person has talked this entire year, they havent had a chance to. He just lectures all class, and skips around alot. The info is an overload and doesnt tell you what to study on the tests. Also he is annoyingly P.C. as he will correct himself numerously</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the first person.
