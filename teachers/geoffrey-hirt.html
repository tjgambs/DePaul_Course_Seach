HE IS RUDE, INCONSIDERATE AND DEGRADES WOMEN STATING THEY SHOULD NOT BE IN FINANCE. WRITING THE BOOK DOES NOT INDICATE PURE KNOWLEDGE OF SUBJECT.

But I guess if its your money you can do what you want. WAIT UNTIL PROF FISHER RETURNS TO TAKE, Fisher will respect your opinion and let you come to your own conclusions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2011<br>Class Name: HON330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A smart and experienced professor, but his ego is too much to handle. I hate professor that think becasue they have some experience that they are the end-all and be-all of finance knowledge. My favorite line: &quot;i thought that this quiz was easy, but apparently you guys didnt&quot;. yeah, were in this class to learn, not already know everything you know!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2010<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this is not the class you want to take. Strictly memorizing stuff from the book that he wrote. The tests are everything and he makes them extremely difficult!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Hirt was a excellent teacher. Because this is the first finance class that you take at Depaul, too many students come into it expecting it to be easy and don't prepare. If this teacher was to hard for you then you don't belong in finance. I'm a senior now and I still say that he is the best finance prof I have had yet!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I basically taught myself the material by reading the book, which is weird bc he wrote the book. Class time is a waste. He only &quot;teaches&quot; certain problems and was actually quite rude at times..he wasnt bad, but he was not good enough...not the type of prof. who makes class interesting or exciting. As a finance major, I was disappointed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Hirt was an excellent teacher. Everyone here who complains about him was obviously not ready to be a finance student. You need to come into his class ready to learn and he will be ready to teach you. He is the best professor at explaining how and why things work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely hard. don't take him. So many homework and long-difficult multiple and essay problems. And sent him more than 5 emails. no response at all. not helpful at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is horrible, do not take him! Doesn't teach and creates stupid exams that do not go along with the material</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Hirt is excellent! Very hard to get an A but you really learn the material. He gives an opportunity for an extra credit and also has a curve in every test. One time-value quiz, which there is no way you can?t get an A on. Take him if you have a passion to learn finance the right way, which is not the easy way? *read the book at least twice!*</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bunch of exams plus a final, a lot of homework,study hard for exams which r multiple choice & written. Rushes thru lectures w/o taking Q's & acts as if should already be a finance expert. Otherwise nice guy. Will work you hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I read the chapters, did most of the problems, went to every class, and studied really hard for the final. He did not teach the class at all, he went over homework problems before we even got a chance to do them. I feel like I had to teach the class to myself and his book might be useful if he explained it better. Don't take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Only take Hirt if you are seriously ready to spend 10-15 hours per week studying and doing homework problems.  He uses class time to show you his work on the homework problems and insult his students intelligence by saying things like &quot;i guess i gave all you guys too much credit.&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't teach any of what will be on tests.  All he talks about in class is his personal experience with investments and other financial things.  Do the homework and read the chapters and you should do well in the class.  Also, there is a group project, you have to do some work but I BSed a lot of it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class requires a lot of work.  The good thing is, he allows extra credit.  The downside...he goes over the homework instead of actually teaching the concepts and he claims to &quot;really challenge the 'A'&quot; student by making the midterm really long considering you only have an hour and a half.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is hard. What makes it even harder is the professor. You have to most of time teach yourself. He is an okay professor, if I had a choice to choose someone else to teach i would choose others. The way he explains homework is pointless. Final and midterm are hard. I ended up with a C, even thought I tried hard trying to keep it to an B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hirt was awesome. He wrote the book and its actually good, he tries to make it fun and relevant and interesting.  I would take another class from him anytime.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr.Hirt is very nice, if you donÂ´t understand your work you can ask him after class and his homework solutions are post before exam. The multiple choice practices are helpful but the exams are hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the person below me is right...but y should he check all the questions when your peers write the questions...they should be able to answer their OWN question right wid an OPEN book...but Hirt is not bad at all...hes very easy on hw and turnin stuff in after its due...hes not easy as far as tests are concerned...but i would take him again...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes you do multiple choice for the test but they are wrong because he doesnt check them and his tests are unbelievably hard. He doesnt give you solutions to the homework to check if you are doing them right and to help you study. He assumes you know Finance before you learn it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Finance is a hard subject over all. Fin310 is the first class a student is exposed to finance, hence the bad reviews on teachers. Im sure the 1st accounting class ppl took was a challenge too. Hirt is a great teacher. His lectures are based on the book that he wrote, so shouldnt that allow use to comprehend more&#63; I would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems nice enough at first, but he makes no sense, and his book does not give clear examples of what needs to be done. He didn't show up for our midterm review because he says he was up til 2 AM the night before. And he blamed it on us!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Hirt is makes finance actually understandable and worthwhile.  He wrote the book, in my opinion, one of the best books I've had.  It was a clear book and a clear class.  He is not lazy, and you will actually learn ALOT about finance. Great Class with Hirt!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>useless- hirt wrote the book and therefore assumes you know wayyy too much, hes not in during office hours and just talks about the pwrpt., you will teach yourself if you do have to take this course, and thats not what youre paying for</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HIRT REALLY TRULY HIRTS!!!
