    She is SO sweet! Very helpful if you catch her during class but don't count on her to respond to your emails. She really cares about her students and what she is teaching, though she is incredibly busy. (I took her at Loyola, she also works for DePaul and the city of chicago) Tests aren't bad, info is directly from power points. overall, good.

    Dr. Suleiman Gonzales is the business! Very few professors can really teach methods and make it interesting. She is very knowledgeable and interested in helping her students get the most out of the material. She rocks!

    Really enjoyed this class.  Infused theory with interesting discussion, examples, video clips, etc.  Received practical information in addition to theory (ie: 30 minute discussion of adolescent gangs).  Grading is easy if you do the work.  Only complaint: prof is late to class almost every day.

    Lots of theories. Kind of confusing explanations.  I always felt she was kind of rushed and never got to fully explain them.  Lots of reading.  Otherwise the class is pretty easy.  She is very knowledgable and very involved with adolescents.

    very knowledgeable on the topic (adolescent development), could have been more proactive about teaching it to us. Still, I learned a LOT and enjoyed the class.

    I found some of her teaching decisions to be very unprofessional and overall she seemed to lack any interest in the students and their success.

    Dr. Suleiman inspires and motivates her students in every one of her lectures.  Her class was an excellent introduction to the masters of education program at Depaul.  She provides a very real and informed approach to the field of teaching and the development of children.
