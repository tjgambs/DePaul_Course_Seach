Sometimes moves too quickly without realizing it. Midterm is worth 50% of your final grade, expect to read and study. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2015<br>Class Name: ECO317<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Owen is an awesome teacher. I wish I could take all of her classes. I took her Labor Economics and  American Economic history class BACK TO BACK last quarter and never got bored. She keeps everything more or less organized and engaging for the subject matter. Her classes aren't particularly tough. I learned a lot of useful information.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2014<br>Class Name: ECO317<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>I liked Professor Owen and learned quite a bit from her class.  I do wish the class was more interesting because the lectures were boring but she does know the material very well.  As long as you listen to what she tells you and do the assignments as told it is not very hard to get an A or B in the class.  Also lots of reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2014<br>Class Name: ECO318<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Though Prof. Owen seems to be a kind person, her teaching is extremely dry. The lectures were at times very confusing. I can't say I left the class more knowledgeable about labor markets.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2013<br>Class Name: ECO317<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice person and really knows her subject matter. She will always answer your questions and do her best to help. The class involves A LOT of reading and the final is all essay based. If you like reading, take this class. If it's not your thing, keep looking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: ECO317<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is boring and so is this class. There is a HUGE amount of reading and did I say boring?</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2012<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was really boring to the point I couldn't learn and did not go to class; however, if you read the book and know the problem sets, the tests are not too difficult. The online quizzes rarely reflect the tests at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: ECO317<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a very easy but boring class.  There are 7 homework assignments which are literally finding 3 quotes from 100+ pages of reading and using them to support or refute and argument. One presentation which was easy and an open note final which is 40% of the grade. Either take notes or borrow someone else's and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: ECO317<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Owen was amazing. There is a lot of reading, and a good amount of lecture, but she is really knowledgeable about the topic. One thing I enjoyed was that her lecture slides were not taken from any publisher. She created them herself, and knows what she wants to talk about that day. She has also incorporated interesting group discussion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: ECO317<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a boring class. Not much class discussion, just lectures from a powerpoint. There are a few homework assignments which aren't that difficult. Since this is an elective class, I'd recommend taking another ECO class. It so boring and Owen's powerpoint teaching isn't for me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very very boring. You have online quizes per chapter, final, midterm, and four journal assignments. If you study and do you're work you'll be fine. But she's really articulate and can be helpful. But OMG the lectures, soo boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2008<br>Class Name: ECO317<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG is the lecture boring !Worse part is she never stops talking ! That said, you have no idea what is expected to get an A or B on the writings, the books and assigned readings have little info. to guide you on the weekly two page papers, and she doesnt provide handouts of her powerpoint slides !! AVOID HER !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>some of the other students in my class were on their 2nd or 3rd time taking it. owen was pretty easy. only had midterm, online quizzes (can take til you get 100% and it gives you the correct answers so theres no reason not to get 100%), journals, and final. i just reread the chapters and the notes before the exams and got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: ECO317<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didnt find this teacher to be nice or easy, although i did manage an A-. If you work hard you will get a good grade, but it isnt just given you will get an A. I did not care for this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2008<br>Class Name: ECO395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one word to describe prof owen: cool!  shes really nice and is helpful.  i must say she is very smart but will never make you feel stupid.  do yourself a favor and take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was extremely boring, but the class was overall an easy A.

She explains the material very well. The problem sets are easy and she's an easy grader. However, there's too much reading for the course. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: ECO318<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at this school.  Gives you almost full credit on HW even if you screw it up.  Tells you what is on tests and examples given in class are almost exactly what you see on exams. Never even really opened the book except to do HW problems which are very few and helpful. HIGHLY RECOMMEND</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No interaction with class what so ever.

I learned quite a lot from her class. She was knowledgeable and passionate about the subject of macroeconomics and displayed very little bias. She works hard to ensure her students understand the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2005<br>Class Name: ECON106MACRO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Owen is a fair instructor and a fair grader.  She really knows her material.  She is laid back and down to earth and will help you with anything you need.  The material is very interesting but at times can be difficult.  Do all of the problem sets as similar ones will be on the exams.  She'll let you know what's expected.  Take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's an easy grader, she goes over everything you'll need to know on the midterm and final during class, you really don't have to go to class that often if you understand the information and since she doesn't take attendence.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2005<br>Class Name: MACROECONOMICS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2004<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So Boring bring your pillow. you really dont have to show up to class because she really doesnt talk about anyhtign inportant read your book and you should be fine and she gives out test guides that are basically the test</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2004<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will do fine on the test if just do the syll. problems and take the multiple tests on the internet the questions more often then not show up on the tests.
