His classes might be long at times, but they are overall easy and entertaining. He is pretty much a funny professor that tries to make his class get a laugh from certain situations. Overall take him if you get a chance. You don't have to do much just some papers and his tests aren't that hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2011<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Jamil is a very easygoing professor. I only attended 2 of the classes and still got an A, probably because I still copied down the notes off D2L and looked at the textbook. He's very personable, and keeps the class interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy going, funny, makes the class interesting and fun.

The mid term and final are the only test. And the only writing is about six one page opinion papers. He always wants to hear about the students' opinion or experiences with adolescent topics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: PSY213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an incredibly friendly guy who is incredibly fair about pushing back tests, papers, etc.  Doesn't encourage attendance OR reading.  However, his tests were unnecessarily difficult, even with a study guide.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2008<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a good teacher.
