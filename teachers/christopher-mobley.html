He does not realize how important his job is. He is much more committed to expressing his baseless, political speculation and personal opinions on a wide variety of subjects. If you want to learn anything, never take him. If you want to have an easy way out, easy grade, childish work take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2005<br>Class Name: PSC225<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't talk at all about the subject of the class.  Mostly basketball, corruption, and drugs.  I honestly feel dumber after taking this &quot;class&quot;.  These 10 weeks represent what's wrong with this university.  Thank goodness he's leaving.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2005<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor... 4 papers, midterm, final paper. Sounds like a lot but he is a reasonable grader.  Doesnt take attendance!!! I would definately take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!  Fair grader!  Does not take attendence!  4 papers, midterm, Final paper, and final exam.  Sounds like a lot but it's reasonable.  Not expecting you to be a political anyalyst just expects you to put forth effort.  I would definitly take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2005<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mobley is an unbelievable professor.  His lectures are interesting and he is a very fair grader.  I worked hard on his papers, and studied for his exams and easily got an A.  He encourages discussion and loves it when students go off on their political views.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2004<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While he is interesting to listen to during lecture, lectures barely relate to class, more like current events and Black history.  Makes a lot of things racial issues when they dont need to be.  Put essays on the midterm that weren't part of his 5 page review sheet or mentioned in class.Dont take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy freshman class.  Just busy work.  If you turn in work late he still gives you full credit.  Take this class, very little work involve.  About 5 assignments from him total.  And 7 from his student teacher, you spend most of the class time talking about whatever is in the newspaper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interestng discussions, funny, never boring, doesn't assign any work pretty much, just show up, and even that is not manditory, just do the paper and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Mobley was a good professor. He's nice and the discussions were a lot of fun. i didn't do any work in that class but i got an A. just do the paper you'll be fine. He was very very helpful and really nice especially if your a freshman. i recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2004<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Contradicts himself,he was not at all helpful to me for this class, and was very inconsistant with grading. I was 2.5 points short of an A, but he gave it to me while my friend was 1 point shy of an A, and she got the A-. He would not explain why.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2004<br>Class Name: POLYSCI<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hey sucks. royally. waste of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2004<br>Class Name: PSC2256<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor!

He was totally unhelpful, boring,and definatly NOT hot. This class was an example of why tenure is bad. It was a complete waste of my tuition money and I demand a refund. Worst ever</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: POLSCI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>excellant professor, i had him in grad. school and he is truly one of the best professors i had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2004<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He tends to repeat himself many times. Also, he grades somewhat oddly on no scale, but he lets you know that DePaul puts a 36% grade cap on A's in ISP classes so good luck getting an A. Also, respond alot to the responses online, your grade depends on it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2004<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>his lectures are pretty interesting and conversational-- not boring whatsoever.

I would never take him again.  Talks more about his personal life than the stuff u need to know and then keeps u there forever.  I couldnt stand his personality either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2003<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Outstanding teacher.
