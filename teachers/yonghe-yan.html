To me, it was not entirely professor's fault. Some of the answers were really crappy too. Some students had no respect at all as they chatted too loud at the back of the room. U cant just blame the guy alone!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2007<br>Class Name: ECT425<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible class, terrible teacher. Grading on his midterm and final (short answer) was way too specific. Grading came down to very minute details at the individual word level that would make or brake an answer. He spent an entire class session explaining his rationale for giving everyone crappy grades, although I didn't even have my test back yet.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2007<br>Class Name: IT430<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is pretty easy.  As long as you get the homework turned in early, you can get some assistance prior to the due date.  The book is useless.  Dr. Yan has a good personality however his teaching style can be dry.  Definitely take this class DL if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: ECT425<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor's accent is really hard to understand. I missed 2 classes and 2 homeworks because I had some work related issues, he was not willing to understand and give me a chance for the extra credit. I needed to take a final exam on the different date bacause of work related problems again, professor was not willing to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2006<br>Class Name: ECT425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty good teacher but can be hard to understand him at times because of accent.  Not to hard either as long as you do some reading here and there.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2005<br>Class Name: ECT310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a Distance Learning student, it was very difficult to understand his explanations due to his accent.  He assumed we had a lot of prerequisite knowledge (which was not a course prerequisite) so I found myself having to learn several things on my own very quickly.  It was a ton of work as a result.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2005<br>Class Name: ECT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Spoke well and was very helpful when I needed help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2005<br>Class Name: ECT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Homework assignments are very easy and no midterm or final exams, just projects.It might take a while to get used to his foreign accent, but he explains things in a way that you can understand.Good lectures and provides good examples in notes.Very approachable although he takes a little longer to answer emails than my experience w/other professors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: ECT353<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His teaching skills and grasp of the English language are so poor I recommend you avoid this guy like the plague.  Seriously, you won't learn anything, you'll have to teach yourself the material to pass.</div></div></div></body></html>
