He understands his students and genuinely cares about their prosperity. He has a very leave no man behind mentality which is all you could ask for in a program intensive class with 30 plus students. It could be draining at times, but that only due to the nature of the class. Brian is top notch. Take his class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2015<br>Class Name: VFX200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Brian is an excellent professor. He demands that you follow along in class (of course) but is very helpful anytime anyone has a question. He really seems to care about his students, both regarding their professional development and on a personal level. I would recommend him to any DC major who takes their work seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2014<br>Class Name: VFX200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brian is awesome! Had him for Visual Effects and Editing 2. He's easy to talk to and always willing to help. He can be stern, but honestly, students need that these days. Loved him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: VFX200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't like Brian at first because of his stern personality. Eventually I warmed up to him though. He definitely wants to see his students learn and will help you if you get lost during class or need some extra assistance or time to complete an assignment. I learned a lot, and the last few assignments ensure that you will become proficient in AE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: VFX200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Military like.
