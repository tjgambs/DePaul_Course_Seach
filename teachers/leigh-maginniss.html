    after taking other biology classes, i came to a realization that maginniss is a rare breed. when i took his class, i took him for granted but now, i respect him dearly. his style of teaching is progressive which makes it so fascinating to learn even when it comes down to boring subjects. this man deserves a nobel peace prize.

    Ok YES hes a very nice old man, very sweet but i think what everyone wants to know is about the course not his personality. It is a H-A-R-D class!!! WAY TOO MUCH chapters reading assigned and too much h/w from lab. DIFFICULT AS HELL for a bio requirement. Yes hes a nice man, but the course is hard, thats all there is to it. HARD HARD HARD!!!

    He is a great teacher. No doubt. His exams are a bit difficult because theres a lot to study but he makes boring subjects interesting. Very passionate and energetic! and he really cares about every single student. and he is also cute for an old man. oolala

    He is very informative, but needs to count lab more towards the final grade for the course.

    He is a great professor. He is very approachable and lectures are entertaining. But you really have to study. His exams are tough.

    Dr. Maginniss is the best teacher that I have had at this school. Not only does he go above and beyond his knowledge in the subject area, he is great in trying to hold the attention of his students.  He uses funny examples that show he is really trying. He is also just a friendly guy to talk to!

    This is one of THE BEST professors I have ever had in my entire college career!  Take any class with him that you can- I've taken a couple of courses with him and they were both interesting and exciting.  Great person, great prof.

    He is a great prof.  You HAVE to study, attend class (every session), and take good notes. If you do all that you can do well in his class.  He is very entertaining and knowledgable. I would def take another class of his!  LOVE HIM!

    He is very clear! He simplifies concepts and drawing in ways that are more easy to digest and remember. He is by far one of the best lecturers for Biology at DePaul, I really enjoyed him. (You do have to put in a lot of effort though)

    Very informative but the class covers a lot of detailed material.  There really arenâ€™t concepts to know like BIO 102, I felt everything was memorization.  Gives outlines of notes that are very helpful come exams.

    He is one of the most helpful teachers I have ever had...as a non-bio major it really made the difference.  He makes class and lab really interesting, but you have to study for the exams.  Take him if you can!

    this guy is nice and cool.  This is the only biology (bio 101-A/102-A-/103) that I got lower than an A- (i got a B+). However, it's because of lab.  But Maganniss's tests are real easy if you study for them.
