    I took her Renaissance Lit class and loved it. Who knew how interesting Paradise Lost could be? Or the Faerie Queene? I started off slow (low grade on first paper) but she helped me figure out how to do better (in her class and all later ones). Great teacher, great class!

    This class is very interesting. The books are all great and there are only 2 papers, 10 mini responses, and 1 test. Not bad at all. The paper grading is a little rough but that is about it. Over all not a bad class

    Professor Marlborough is so enjoyable!  If her class is up for a great discussion, she's a wonderful facilitator.  If it's a particularly dull day for the students, she doesn't get hostile, but goes with the flow.  She teaches in a very clear way that is easy to understand, which is often incredibly helpful juxtaposed with the challenging work.

    Lovely woman, great teacher, nice class, cool discussions, helpful, kind, appropriate level of work.  the only criticism I have is that she could maybe hold the bar a little higher.  Otherwise, all-around good experience.

    Professor Marlborough is a nice adorable professor.  While the discussions can get a bit dry because we spent so long discussing each book, if you are having any trouble she is very willing to help.  No Textbook, jut 8 or 10 novels, about 1 a week.  She is very knowledgeable, and again such a sweet woman.

    I am not a huge fan of literature, but I love great discussions. Keeping in mind that Professor Marlborough is the Director of Honors Program,I was expecting great class discussions.That did not happen - no discussions,just going line by line what was read. Her grading is confusing - writes great comments and gives a B.She is a sweet person though.

    Dr. Marlborough is an eloquent, knowledgeable professor.  I enjoyed her well-picked literature, which she disscected cover to cover.  She is an easy, even merciful, grader on her papers.  Considering her approachable personality and enthusiasm, I would recommend taking her courses to anyone who wants (not is reluctant) to learn and work.

    Her class was incredibly dry and boring. She stands there behind her podium and goes line by line through the reading and doesn't really let her students talk. She's very big on English history too. She's a harsh grader. Class breakdown: Weekly in-class work, 1st paper is 3 pages, Written Midterm and Final, 2nd Paper is 5-6 pages, research involved

    She really is a classic professor, compelte with the Tiffany's lamp in her office! Really nice, will make time to help you with a paper, responds to e-mails really quickly. I REALLY don't see where the Christian fanatic thing is coming from. I had her for 3 classes &amp; I'm not even an English major!

    I took her for my capstone, and she was wonderful. As for the person who said you can't express rel. views outside of Christianity, you are wrong here. My final paper was on how pagan religions can be viewed as theater. I also got an A on it. She is a great techer, though a bit dull at times.

    Nice lady and very intelligent. She's so awesome, that I have taken her three times. She's truly a classic professor. I must disagree with the Christian fanatic label as well. Be advised, you must be able to write well.

    Cool prof. &amp; very helpful outside of the classroom. Some of the reading selections were rather dull &amp; if you take her for a night class expect to get a little antsy or bored. Otherwise very nice lady.

    Great teacher, so erudite. She comes off as very placid, but the woman is the real thing and she knows her stuff. Has an amazing breadth of knowledge that she can tap into in conjunction with most topics. She knows more than you do, get used to it, enjoy!

    She is nice and very knowledgeable. I don't think she'a a 'fanatic Christian' as someone else said, but I did realize that she grades papers according to how well you apply what she has taught, and not on how original or creative you are.

    Great professor. I personally don't find her to be a Christian fanatic (like one person reported). Very knowledgeable, very intelligent, makes jokes, and will always help you out if you don't understand something. Know you will have to write well.

    If you're an extremist Christian, this is the teacher for you. If you like to think for yourself, don't express your views in her course, or she'll target you by docking your grades in assignments, because of her differing, close-minded beliefs.

    She's the nicest teacher ever!!  She's extremely informed about English, and she's very helpful.  I've taken her for 3 classes, and she is my English advisor.  I highly recommend her for any English class.
