Every class you miss is 10% off your final grade, but you can do a two-page paper to make it up, and he graded those fairly easily. It's a lot of reading, but I'm used to that as an English major. He brought in a lot of outside resources and was usually interesting. Poetry was occasionally dull, but eh.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2014<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor.  Class I took with him was a two week class.  He went out of his way to scan copies of the material we needed because the bookstore was out of the book.  Great wealth of knowledge and am planning on taking again if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2013<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great and interesting professor.

Nine novels, so only 1 week per book, but he wastes all our time by rereading the book to us. I'm an English major, I want to have actual discussions about the books & their issues, not go paragraph by paragraph like high school. If you are an English major like myself DO NOT TAKE HIM!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2011<br>Class Name: ENG400<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man changed my life.

He reminds me a little of Andy Warhol.  Listening to his lectures makes you really appreciate what you're reading.  He teaches the way I would like to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2007<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is easy, but somewhat boring. Well chosen texts. Tells you what things mean as opposed to discussion. Not always hospitable to other opinions/interpretation. Lectures always turn to preaches on either Vietnam, Iraq, and/or lambasts of current political leaders. Whether or not you agree with his politics, it still gets annoying and distracting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2007<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting guy, you might not think so when you first mee him but he has a good sense of humor.

His lectures are long and drawn out, but relevant.  If you are a republican or at all conservative then I suggest you dont take him because you will be insulted much to the amusement of us liberals.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2006<br>Class Name: ENG245<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Man looks like Tommy Hilfiger..easy grader..talked about the war in Iraq a lot and tried to relate it to everything</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: ENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2004<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he could be a bit boring sometimes, but even with having him for a night class is wasnt too bad..  he tries to be funny, though sometimes it's not the case.. overall hes a really easy grader.. quizes are easy.. if you want and easy class, take it with him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Having a night class with him was rough, but he tries to keep it interesting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice and helpful.  If you like quirky people, you'll get a big kick out of him.
