Some people felt that she was hard to understand, but if they didn't spend all of their time on the phone or complaining they would have been more successful. I loved Gabi, definitely recommend summer physics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2013<br>Class Name: PHY156<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Gabi during the summer class and it was by far the worst teaching experience I have had at DePaul. She seemed to be unprepared for class and got mad when any student asked a question for further clarification in regards to the material. I learned more from the text book! I felt unprepared for all of the quizzes/exams and my grade showed it.</div></div></div></body></html>
