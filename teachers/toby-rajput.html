    This class is very easy, no midterms, just come to class, and do the homework. One paper 2-3 pages, and a final. This class was fun, but at times really boring. She really likes talking about books, so get prepared for a book waved coming at you. But if you want an easy A, this is the class, to take.

    She is very passionate about the subject.  At times class could be boring, but overall she does her best to make it fun.  It feels as if we are all in 5th grade again.  She is very knowledgeable and is extremely helpful, considerate and understanding.

    She does love the subject and knows what she is talking about, but if you are an ECE major, i advise you to take a different teacher.  Although I learned a lot, I do not feel I learned enough about the area I am going into.
