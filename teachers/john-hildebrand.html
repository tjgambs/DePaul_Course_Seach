The work is super easy, you learn a substantial amount. The required participation and discussion is a major part of your grade. Every student is required to add to the discussion by summarizing the reading or giving an opinion on it. There are readings prior to every class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2015<br>Class Name: CONSUMERCULT1<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you don't think like he does, don't bother.

I took him over the summer for my senior seminar, and have no regrets. He gives lots of reading and daily quizzes based on the readings, but they're all really interesting! Don't take him if you're looking for an easy A, but DEFINITELY take him if you want to learn something. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2015<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>I really disliked the structure of this course. Participation in class is worth the equivalent as all the papers you write, so even if you have knowledge, it means nothing because he cares more about talking about it than knowing about it. He also gives out like 2 hours worth of readings for HW and has a quiz every week. Would go a different route</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2015<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Took for ICS 392, 3 hour course once a week. A lot of reading, but on interesting, eye opening topics that are easy to discuss during class, which you must do. Before every class is a quiz on the readings, if you did the readings it'll be a breeze. Three 1,000 word essays throughout the quarter on really easy topics. Not an easy A but not hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a great class for a senior capstone.  There is reading involved, but they are not boring or dry.  Really can relate to all articles as a business student.  Best class I have taken at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2014<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Basically if you watch the videos you have to for this class you will learn more than you actually do in the actual class. You never have any idea what grade you are getting, which is extremely frustrating. But on the other hand you can redo assignments for a better grade and that is pretty awesome. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2011<br>Class Name: ECON6100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unethical - he showed up late, read straight from textbook powerpoint slides - NO IDEA how to teach, NO classroom discussion, NO feedback, Final exam was not comprehensive and solely based on a worksheet he gave out the night before the exam.  I am very puzzled by previous comments.  This was not an online class.  I WANT MY MONEY and TIME BACK!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2010<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him over the summer and I was scared I wouldn't do well because he seems really strict, but ended up with an A even thought I screwed up some quizzes and missed one class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2008<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He may look like a jerk when he does give you many reading assignments, but they are all online, so you don't have to purchase a book. He is like a philosophy teacher, no right or wrong answer, as long as you can argue your point. Rewards hard work, and a very fair grader. Loved him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2008<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hildebrand gives a ton of reading assignments and then quizzes you on the smallest detail from each article.  The articles are sometimes 20 pages long and there could be as many as 5 assigned per class.  Once you can handle that, there are three essays that he grades fairly.  Don't miss class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2008<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>John keeps it real. There is a decent amount of reading but his coursework will give you new eyes.  Be prepared for regular quizzes on the readings and make it a point to speak up in class.  Don't miss class or you will get to write a 2000+ word research paper.  He is a fair grader and shares some unique experiences. Like learning&#63;-take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2008<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof. Stimulates great conversations each class and really makes you think. VERY fair grader and doesn't give you pointless, long assignments to work on. Two papers- 3-6 pages, not hard. Final optional if you attend all classes and do well on daily quizzes and discussions.  Knows his stuff and is a nice guy. Recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2007<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really bad professor.  Honestly, he is ****.  If he doesnâ€™t like you it will reflect in his grade.  Truly one of the worst professors at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2007<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor that provides interesting reading material and promotes great discussion in the class. The paper topics are interesting and fun, both a 1000 words so not rigurous. Group presentation is straight forward and should not take more than a couple of hours to but togethe, since it is on one article. Great class + Great professor = :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2006<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not hard but lots of reading. 2papers of 1000 words, one final and a group presentation.</div></div></div></body></html>
