Always kept the class on topic while still making the material fun. You definitely learn a lot about creativity and the assignments are manageable. Get a good group for your project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Not an effective teacher. He doesn't know the right questions to ask students to get them to think outside the box. The class is very repetitive and the presentations each week aren't necessary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2013<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take someone else. This guy is average, cocky, and rude at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2012<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was very entertaining and enjoyable. Felt the projects/assignments were fitting and helpful. Seems nice and cool in class, but not sure how exactly he grades and what he is looking for.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2012<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is funny and really keeps students engaged in class. I enjoyed every day of his class. I feel the material covered in this class. Is easier than most but there is a lot of work to keep up with. I can't see anyone failing as long as you put the time in to do the work accurately. I had a lot of fun in his class!! Definitely recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2012<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Class you will take as a Business Student. If you dont like ICS you probably belong to the CDM college or music school. Javier will challange you and it will pay off. Its an easy class, just particpate, ask questions, and its an easy A. BEST CLASS YET< EZ A!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2012<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was frustrating at times but I worked hard with my group and received an "A". If you are lazy, don't like responding to emails and are waiting around for someone else to do all the work, then don't take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2011<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WARNING: 70% of the reviews below are written by the professor himself. Some questions on his quizes he never goes over. 8-10 hours a week outside of class work (If you have a poor group). Very bad at responding to e-mails and is very rude in his feedback. Him in the class and him via e-mail are 2 completely different people....Good Luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2011<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved the class although there is way too much group work. Choose wisely your group members and you will be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2011<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be careful when choosing your group. Once you choose a group you have to work with them for the next 10 weeks. We had 5 people, 1 person left the group, left with four. 1 (group leader) of the 4 was too busy working. So, While other groups had 6 in their group we had 3 (practically)..and ended up with a bad Grade. Monllor is NOT cooperative AT ALL.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Find a good group, there is a LOT of group work. Javier is a cool guy and the tests are fairly easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2011<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty cool class!  Make sure you get a good group because his assignments and the project are related.  A few easy quizzes and entrepreneur speakers.  His powerpoints are from the book so you don't need to buy it.  And he's boricua!  Sexy!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Laid back guy, pretty straightforward. Lots of work for this class, expect assignments (sometimes 2) due every week. Not very difficult work, but can be time consuming at times. Definitely take him if you're interested in entrepreneurship.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2011<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was great. Make sure you form a good group as there are weekly assignments of 10+ pg writeups, but this isn't hard with 5+ people in a group. Plus, these assignments are all put together for your final paper, so if you do it right youre final project will be done. Monllor is a good guy but doesnt give points away. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2011<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is a nice guy but the class lacks substance. I don't know if it's his teaching or the department curriculum. Didn't really learn anything and tons of busywork. It's almost like a creative writing class constrained to your groups faux-company. Easy A, but time consuming.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2011<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A, huge time-sink. 50% of the grade is a group project.  Expect to learn nothing while writing 10+ pages of nonsense per week starting after week 5. Might be alright if you have a decent group to split work.  Terrible for me, this class ate &gt;8hrs/wk for me starting week 5 writing pure nonsense about nothing to meet the 10 page minimum.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2011<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked him at first but he is kind of a **** if you ask him questions - makes it seem like you are inconveniencing him. Overall not the best teacher but not the worst either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best teacher at DePaul. If you want to be an entrepreneur or learn about entrepreneurship, he is the best in his field to learn first hand experiences. You will learn , have fun, and  get a good grade. He helps students every-time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2010<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's super sexy, take him!  Just be warned you will be stuck in a large group people and will be doing a project once, sometimes even twice, a week so if you are not into group work you will suffer as the groups are big and its super annoying.  You will wish u could just do it all alone because you would do it faster.  I was frustrated all quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2010<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the guy is just boring. Does not seem to know the subject well. you do not learn much in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2010<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hi is one of the best prof at DePaul. His class exercises are  amazing and very informative. If you work and follow his guidelines, you will be perfectly fine. He is also very helpful.. Do take him :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2010<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Monllor is a great teacher who gets his students engaged with modern examples and exciting classes. I never ditched this class because it was one I looked forward to attending. Choose this Professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2010<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an extremely nice teacher. Just as long as you're doing your work, you'll do well with the class. Although he's a little uninformative on his grading, he's a great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2010<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I rather come to class watch him teach than engage in the course. He is so extremely good looking!!! lol but anyway, this course is extremely time consuming. Pick and choose your group members wisely because they will be working on your final campaign project with you for the whole quarter. Pick responsible team!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2010<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I often doze off in class but he's awesome</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2010<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor Take course with this professor if you want to pass with a good grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2010<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is a breeze.

His class is a no-brainer/joke but he likes to randomly knock off points from quizzes, exams, elevator pitches etc. He does not JUSTIFY his grading. You will not learn anything and his powerpoints literally consist of pictures. You don't need the textbook cause he doesn't use it. Take anyone else besides this guy. Trust </div></div></div></body></html>
