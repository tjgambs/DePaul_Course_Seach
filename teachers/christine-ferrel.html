She only uses problems from the book in her lectures. She isn't clear when she tries to explain how to do a problem & she messes up a lot when she's doing the problems on the board, and apologizes about it like 5 times, over and over again. *Boring* class & I didn't learn much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: MATH101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really bouncy, and fun to watch at times. Her homework assignments are SO short compared to other math classes. She is very easy on her students. If you have trouble with math- take her!!</div></div></div></body></html>
