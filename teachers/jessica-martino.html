    I was struggling in this class and Martino offered VERY little help. She suggested I see a tutor, but if she's the professor and has office hours I'm not sure why she couldn't help me. Do not take her.

    I've learned French all over again through her class, and I've loved it. She's very nice, underdstanding, and interested in what she teaches. There is alot of reliance on the textbook, but she's also creative with class exercises. She offers extra credit on tests and grades fair. If you are new to French, take her!

    I really enjoyed her class. Since she is a native english speaker, she understood the problems we had with the language and was able to explain solutions very clearly. Very approachable and kind, really seems to care about students. Brought us macarons and orangina for mardi gras! Awesome.

    I really enjoyed her class. She is a very fair teacher who really cares about her students. She works with her students to help them and curves tests when they dont work out so well. Shes not easy but not the hardest. I have a lot of respect for her and i would really recommend her. although challenging, your better for it.

    Her class was very easy but I feel like I can understand the language more.  She spoke French pretty much all the time and I could understand her.

    Somewhat nice professor. However, she can't teach well, and was not helpful. She basically used the book the whole time and her tests were very hard. basically horrible teacher and harder than it should be class for french beginners.

    Professor wants you to succeed! I definitely did B work in the class and she gave me an A. You need to do about 5 compositions and a few oral presentations but she's not a rough grader. Don't miss more than 2 absences or she'll start lowering your grade. All exams came with a chance for extra credit and a study guide.
