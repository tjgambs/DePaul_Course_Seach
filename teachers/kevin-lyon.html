There are essays where you are expected to have more than 4 including a portfolio, which will count as a final. No midterm, however, he is a hard grader. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, You have to work for your grade but he grades fair. Just MAKE SURE you participate in class, then he'll like you and i think he grades easier on you too. Good class, the assignments actually made me think about writing and what an education means. One or two skipped classes is ok but I wouldn't go crazy with the absences.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2014<br>Class Name: 103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't really like the way that he writes his assignments.  The descriptions are really vague and hard to understand what he wants you to do or write. Little to no feedback in his class, and he is a terribly slow grader.  Wish there was more feedback and easier to understand rubrics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>I love Professor Lyon. It's hard not to. He's hilarious and really personable. His class if challenging but really easy. I got 100's on all of my papers. (I'm a writing minor though.) And, he was very understanding and helpful when I had to take an incomplete for personal reasons</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lyon is awesome. Though most of the assignments seem redundant, they actually help with the final paper. You barely use the book. He is always willing to help his students with the assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall easy class. Some assignments were redundant but overall he is very helpful and gives great advice and feedback. Computer based which was convenient. Barely used the text book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a first year writing course, it's not very interesting nor exciting, but Prof. Lyon makes it as bearable as possible.  Very easy to talk to. Make sure you stick to an interesting topic for your argumentative paper because that's what you'll be focusing on all quarter long.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is extremely helpful with explanations, and class was relatively insightful. He's an easy grader on the papers but grades intensely on the midterm and final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lyon is the best. He was very intimidating on his first day of class, but was super cool besides that. He's very helpful... even helped me with papers for other classes. Definitely recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's the best! Fair and easy grader. He'll appreciate students that are active/engaged during class discussions. It's a really easy class, just make sure you're there and not falling asleep and you should do just fine. Grades consist of 4 papers, midterm portfolio and a final portfolio. (Maybe attendance too, not sure. But make sure you're there!)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such a cool guy! Always willing to help students and be engaged in class. He grades fairly and loves to make the class laugh. I never read a page out of the book because the class discussion covers the main points. I always looked forward to going to his class. Taking this class with a few friends will make it more fun too</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is a required class, but you will still gain a lot from it.  Readings are dull, but guide the work you do, so useful still.  He is very helpful, and answers emails quickly or is available in his office.  Explains papers well, and grades fairly.  I would recommend this instructor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horribly structured class, in part due to the University and in part due to the Professor. Class discussions are boring and serve no purpose other than to waste time. Multiple weeks were spent relearning the same material. If it wasn't for the mandatory attendance I could have never shown up to class and still done well. Avoid if you can.</div></div></div></body></html>
