Bottom line. Class could have been really fun because I love art but he is so annoying and is rude half the time. Just dont take. You have to read super long articles and then write papers and discuss them in class. If you don;t paarticipate you will fail this class. I hated him. I just thought he was a bad teacher. DONT TAKE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2015<br>Class Name: HAA101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes terrible.

Readings followed by papers every week. Thursdays are discussions days where participation is mandatory, it is part of the grade for the weekly papers. Lectures are super boring. Do not take this class if you don't like to participate. There are however no quizzes and no big homework assignments besides the weekly readingspapers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Immersion week was fun even though we went to some sketchy places. There is more work involved with this class than the others and the essay prompts were difficult. He has a lot of graded discussions, so if you don't like that, don't take the class. The lectures are boring and long. Overall the class was okay mostly because the students were great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2010<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows his stuff and incorporates many different learning styles into each lesson. The discover class is not a blow off class, as one may assume. Take notes for every lecture, no matter how insignificant something may seem. Using vocabulary correctly in papers is extremely helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took his focal point seminar; I enjoy art classes & I learned a lot. He has a lot of insight & knows his subject thoroughly. Easy to get on his good side by participating a lot in class. Not hard to get an &quot;A&quot;.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not an art student but I thoroughly enjoyed his class. I learned a lot and I didn't find him arrogant in the least. We studied his art because he's a prominent artist on campus and in the Chicago area. He's very entertaining.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2007<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very arrogant as stated above and very subjective. Often picks favorites and holds certain students to higher standards. Get on his good side. You'll either like him or you won't at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2006<br>Class Name: DISC111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very concieted, makes students study his own work. For community service, we didnt help the less fortunate, we primed a wall so he could later paint a mural with his other art students. Has alot of favorites and isnt shy about it.  He seems like he could be nice man but I cant get over his arrogance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2006<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We seemed to do more work than my friends in other discover classes but I liked it. Immersion week was awesome. More about looking at social activism through art than the art itself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: VARIOUSCLASSES<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We had an interesting relationship, he expected more from me then any other student and held my work to a higher standard.  For this I thank him,  I always had to bring my  &quot;A&quot; game.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this man!!!  I am not an art major, but I loved going to his class.  The class I took was three hours long on Fridays, but I did not mind because I thought he was interesting.  If you do the readings, journals, and participate--not only will you get an A, but you will be interested.  The people who thought he was boring probably didn't.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What an awsome class. Brother Mark is a great guy. Not at all what the other posts say, he will help you out, a lot of field trips and is a easy class. I higly recomend it, and im not an art student and it was really fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought his class was good. He is really easy and he's also a nice guy. He does not talk about himself as much as everyone else claims. He is kind of strange sometimes, but he is very helpful and knows a lot about the subject. I enjoyed his class very much!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: ART<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HATE HIM!  He loves himself waaaaaaay too much.  He only talks about himself and he's just plain annoying, but if you smile and pretend to listen it's the easiest A you will ever receive.  Do anything to avoid this teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2004<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so cocky.  If you want to hear him speak about himself for the whole class take this class.  The class would have been interesting if it wasn't for him.  He always plays with his beard and is incredbily annoying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Thought this class would be hard but it wasnt. Only had to write a 1 pg paper a week on some art stuff. Most of the time, the whole class slept and he didnt care. Very UNFAIR Grader unless ur a female! 92mid + 100hw = b- &#63;!&#63;!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just looking at his name gives me the creeps. Most boring class I have ever taken. He appears to be nice but heâ€™s not. Grades VERY hard! Thanks to him, I decided to change my major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice guy but tough class kinda boring yet interesting. u have to force urself to participate and attend becaus thats a BIG part of ur grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Helpful and nice guy. Probably should not be teaching, but has a great knowledge of art.  Weekly reading assignments about 10 pages long.  Participation & attendence count big time.  Overall not a bad class. And you don't have to be artistic either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As an artist, he has a lot of experience with what he teaches. I can see how his readings would be a total bore for the non-art crowd. Overall, he made the course pretty interesting, especially when he led us around the Southside dressed as &quot;Buffalo</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2004<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I will neer ever take a class with this professor ever again.  He is the worst professor that I have ever had.  He is unfair with grades.  He seems nice, but the truth is he not. --STAY AWAY....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He tends to laugh at his own jokes and is laid back. However, he grades on participation and journal entries. It was somewhat hard, but if you ask me I would not take a class from him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2004<br>Class Name: CREATART<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His humor is not funny, his classes are boring, he means well, just should not teach. Reminds me of Ulysses S. Grant with the curled mustache. Is an artist not a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes a nice guy but man the class is hard! the journal reading assignments are a PAIN and he takes attendance way too serious. I dont recommend the class at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an awsome guy, very laid back.

He likes to make you think.  He does use a lot of his own work as examples, and shows off his own work....  you would think he would be more humble, but still very good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The organization of this course was very much a disappointment. As a matter of fact, I don't know why this course is required. And for final exams, Elder loses assignments and then fails students for it-unfair! Then replaces the grade with a C after all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2003<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was my Focal Point and it was a lot harder than I expected it to be. Attendance is a very big deal for Prof. Elder. He's a bit unclear about what he's looking for regarding his journal assignments. He grades harshly on participation as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2003<br>Class Name: DISCCHI<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took his Discover Chicago class. He's a nice guy, although he seems to be a little bit full of himself. The journals were a B*tch.. but I guess if you spread them out it wouldn't be a big deal.
