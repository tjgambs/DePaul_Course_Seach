One of the nicest women you will ever meet. Our class not only learned a tremendous amount from her, but from her friends and colleagues who occasionally gave us tours, etc. Most of the time we were out of the classroom (awesome!). Worth every penny of my tuition.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For a focal point class, I definitely think it was the most fun one.  We went on a lot of field trips, which was nice to learn hands on like that.  I really enjoyed her class, and she really does want everyone to succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2011<br>Class Name: CSS300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whatever was written about her in this website is really right. She is very helpful and very understanding. She is too good to be described in few words. I extremely enjoyed her class, and I really recommend her to anyone who does not want to take an internship. She is my favorite professor ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2011<br>Class Name: CSS300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take her. She really knows her stuff. I actually learned an incredible amount about non-profits and had fun at the same time. This was by far my favorite class I've taken at DePaul so far.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2011<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for my focal point and she was fun, intelligent, and very clear and consistant about expectations. She pushed you to be a better writer, thinker, and active participant in class. You also spent most of the class on foot, outside in the beatiful springtime! Deffinatley take her even if you may not like the topic, she will make it fun!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her for the Frank Lloyd Wright Focal Point class, and this lady really knows her stuff! Even if you had no prior experience or interest in the topics, you will come away from this class as an enthusiastic expert on what she taught. Probably one of the nicest teachers I've had too. She's a sweetheart, take her!</div></div></div></body></html>
