I'm bad at math and he was able to help me learn. He's willing to hear you out, you need to be willing to tell him to slow down, and he's always open for questions. Attendance isn't mandatory, but if you don't attend religiously, it'll be way harder.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2015<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard teacher. He bases most of your grades on three exams and if you don't do well on one of the exams you'll have a hard time trying to get a decent grade after that. He also does not explain the material very well and goes too quickly in lectures. He will meet with you if you need help but sadly I never felt he cared how I did in the class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: CHILDPSY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree, I cant imagine the first commenter having justification for thier comment.
