I'm not really into his teaching style. He is good tho but if you are the type of student who like using book instead of mylabplus don't take him.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2015<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked his class and he's pretty cute so that's always a plus. His exams are not difficult, just do the homework assignments and study those problems and you will be fine.
