He doesn't "teach" in the conventional sense of the word, however. This is NOT A BAD THING. He gives you the content material, but you, as the student, must also take responsiblity for your own education. Many times this requires organizing information outside of class in a way that make sense to you. Then you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2013<br>Class Name: TOXICOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Masken is a very nice person, but he is a terrible professor. He literally reads out of a binder and thus does not notice when people raise their hands to ask questions. He is also hard of hearing and cannot hear you if you try to politely interrupt to ask a question, so all your questions go unanswered.Awful class. AVOID AT ALL COST!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2012<br>Class Name: BIO134<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am a Chemistry major and was taking this class as an elective as a sophomore because I had already passed the main Biology courses and thought this class would be easy. The tests are ALL fill in the blank and have nothing to do with the book or anything relevant to course description. Now I have to take this course again. It is horrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2012<br>Class Name: BIO134<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wanted to like this class, but his teaching style is incredibly ridiculous and out of date. He doesn't even technically 'teach', he stands in front of the room and lectures, and rambles on at a volume level that is incredibly hard to understand. Please DO NOT TAKE HIM. This is the kind of professor that should not be teaching anymore.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2012<br>Class Name: BIO386<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the WORST teacher I have had in my entire academic career. I had to teach myself the whole class. Like a commenter below said- he does not teach, he lectures, with NO supplemental materials, not even corresponding book chapters. He lectures so quickly, mumbling inaudibly the whole time. PRE-MED/PA/ VET/PT  STAY AWAY!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2012<br>Class Name: BIO134<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor. Funny and helpful. He does talk quickly and quietly so I would suggest a recorder to help with what you miss. All you really need to do is attend class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2011<br>Class Name: BIO221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is incredible nice and when i went to him with any questions, he was more than happy to answer. I wonder if all these negatives are just people being lazy, because if you work hard and visit office hours, it is totally possible to do well. Get off your butts and work for the grade you want. He's also hugely knowledgeable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2010<br>Class Name: BIO365<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Masken is one of my all time favorite teachers at Depaul. He is also the hardest teacher I have ever had but that just makes the class all the more satisfying. He can't hear well and doesn't use powerpoint or anything so you HAVE to attend class and I wouldn't have survived a recorder! Classes are interesting and funny though so they go quickly</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2010<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dont understand his bad reviews at all. I was scared of takign his class after reading these but he honestly was a very knowledgable and interesting guy. He does try to help if you need it & yes he does talk ALOT, but with all the info he needs to teach it's kind of obvious. It's a hard class, but if your looking to dip into science, i recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: HISTO311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does not teach; he lectures. The learning is all up to the student. This class is all about effective studying, and if you put in the time and effort you will do well in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2009<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Masken won't really pay attention to raised hands so you have to shout out your questions (and you will have them- he's not the clearest speaker).  I'm not exactly a science whiz, but I studied hard (from the TONS of class notes) and got a B.  Definitely learned learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2009<br>Class Name: BIO347<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never used the book. Lecture consists of him talking the entire time. Tests are on very detailed information that you either caught while trying to take notes as fast as you could.  Attendance is mandatory in order to get all the notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: BIO311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is awful. He mumbles when he teaches and is barely audible. The tests are basically a free for all and does not cover anything in the book. He only tests from his lecture notes. DO NOT take this class. He tests on minute details and is inconsistent in his testing. The lab practical is equally as awful and tedious.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2007<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy needs somebody to teach him how to teach.  He gets in front of the class and rambles from start to finish.  Never allows time for questions.  He is lazy and presents material not present in the textbook.  He moves fast and shaves off 2 hours of class every week.  I would have been better off with Charlie Brown's teacher!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do Not take his class! It is almost impossible to get anything higher than a C+. You can fail all his exams (like I did), but if you do all the assignments he will pass you at the very least. Stay away from this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2006<br>Class Name: BIO201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Masken's anatomy class the last quarter of my senior year and found it very, very informative. Situation is this..most of you rely too much on the professor for grades. This is not a hard class, just very time consuming and a lot of work. Yes he is an old, bad teacher but that should not matter. Go home and study study study! Earn your grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: BIO201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes my friends, I should have heeded the warnings on here, but unfortunately I thought I could beat the odds. I too wanted to end my life after studying for the exams, and I found out that if I studied a lot or did not study at all, I still achieved about the same grades on the exams, which were not failing, but not the best. Heed the warnings!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2006<br>Class Name: ANATOMY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2006<br>Class Name: ANATOMY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2006<br>Class Name: ANATOMY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>his traditional teaching methods should have been fossilized centuries ago. surprisingly, i did better on exams when i started ditching the lectures. there are 4 exams and 2 practicums. i spent allnighters on all 6 and many times, i wanted to end my life.  i think i'm gonna give him a book by john dewey for his retirement present.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2006<br>Class Name: HISTOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Study from his notes, study early in his classes (do not fall behind!  You cannot cram for his tests), don't waste your precious time with the book unless you need clarification.  Not a very good professor- he just wants you to regurgitate a bunch of nit-picky facts that you'll never remember again.  Does not teach overall concepts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Masken is a good professor, though very hard to read.  Unfortunately he doesn't give study guides or a lot of guidance on anything exact to study for, so there's the risk of studying the wrong things.  An interesting class none the less and he's certainly not a BAD profesor, just not my favorite.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2005<br>Class Name: ENDOCRINOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Masken gives you a lot more information in the lecture than he will ever test you on. If you go to his office hours, he will explain any of your questions. As long as you have an interest in physiology/endocrinology, you'll love the class. Just go to class, take good notes, make notecards, and study hard, and you'll get an A. Guaranteed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: ANATOMY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>neeeeever again will i take his class.. if you do make sure to never ask questions because you will get on his bad side.. and yea buy a recorder cuz no one can keep up with his pace</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2005<br>Class Name: ANATOMY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2005<br>Class Name: HISTOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2005<br>Class Name: BIO201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher, unfortunately not many students like students like him because he is old fashioned but he knows his stuff, always willing to help</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: HISTOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't learn my lesson from Anatomy (thought I did bad in Anatomy b/c I was a soph..)
