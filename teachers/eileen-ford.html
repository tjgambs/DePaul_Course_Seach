Attend class and do your papers (there are only two) and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2008<br>Class Name: HIS238<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is extremely passionate about the subject and she makes sure she does her job of teaching the student an overall picture of the history of the reh=gion she is teaching. She has a great system of teaching. Don't worry too much about reading the book. She'll give you key terms on a review sheet before each exam. Just study those terms.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2008<br>Class Name: HST203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's kind of uptight and crazy about little picky things, but overall the class is easy. pretty boring, and she just reads off her notes, but still an easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2008<br>Class Name: HST303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am confused as to why she has negative ratings...probably because she teaches intro classes that people have to take even if they don't want to. That said, Dr. Ford is so enthusiastic and passionate that it is impossible not to get into the topic. She is sweet and helpful. She is very smart and chooses great readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2008<br>Class Name: HST206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was very easy the tests are straight forward and clear.  She basically tells you the answers to the tests the class before you take them, she is nice and helpfull. I would recomend taking her for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2007<br>Class Name: HIST203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy multiple choice midterm, not sure how anyone found it misleading.  Easy map quiz and relatively easy essay final.  Overall I learned a lot and it was a film class.  Took it because I had some tough classes this quarter, in my opinion she is a great teacher.  She seemed to value everyone's opinion during discussions, even bad ones.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: HST203<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Look, what Ludlow Massacre has to do with Latin American history so that it was on the final&#63; She manly focused on Mexico and her Midterm was horrible. will never take this teacher again...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: HST203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did not think she was that bad of a teacher.  Yes, her midterm was designed in a very &quot;tricky&quot; way.  However I still thought she was very friendly, knowledgeable, and sympathetic towards the issues and needs of her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2007<br>Class Name: HSTU<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst professor in the History Department. She is nervous all the time and insecure in her teaching. Can not answer challenging questions or avoids it with diversionary answers. Her Midterm is there to trick you and mislead you. But when you realize that she got her PhD from the UIC, then you understand why is she so weak.Very Very bad teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2007<br>Class Name: HST203<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I never really cared for her from the beginning.  She is incredibly knit-picky, flips out if you are even ten minutes late.  She also lectures too much, and simply seems caught up in hearing herself talk, and less with having the students ask questions.  Definitely had obvious favorites. INCREDIBLY BORING CLASS, IN GENERAL!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2007<br>Class Name: HIST204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor.  She does give a lot of reading and does not offer any extra credit, but is truly interested in the subject of history through film and wants to hear the students opinions. Recommended but not necessarily an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2007<br>Class Name: HST204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED HER!!!! such a nice lady!! shes opinionated in discussions but its awesome! EASY GRADER!TAKE THE LATIN AMERICAN FILM class, all about movies!! so fun!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2007<br>Class Name: HST206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Ford was one of the kindest, most down to earth professors I have ever had in my life. She is a gem when compared to many of the other professors at DePaul. She presents complex concepts to the class in an accessible, compelling way. If you take any of her classes do the reading, she loves students who participate and who have things to add.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2006<br>Class Name: HST205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class.

Don't be late she will b****!!
