You will read several thought-provoking books. However, Joby tends to be as idealistic about workload and time as he is about education reform. Overall, the class is engaging and worth-taking. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2013<br>Class Name: CS751<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing instructor. He was helpful, friendly, caring and most importantly was open to student's opinions.  Did not demand that students see things 'his way' like so many others at DePaul. He was helpful and provided many suggestions. Organized official snacks for class to bring. Would definitely recommend taking any of his classes - he truly cares!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2012<br>Class Name: TCH320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the nicest people I have ever met in my whole life.

Great guy, but will lose papers, and not respond to emails.  Do not take his classes unless you are patient and can deal with chaos.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2011<br>Class Name: CS488<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joby is a very passionate teacher. It's so nice to have a professor who really puts effort into making learning interesting and challenging all at the same time.

He made a 3hr, 8am class really fun and interesting. He helped me fall in love with my future career choice and made me realize what it means to be a good teacher. He is a good grader and gives lots of feedback. The readings he assigns also relate so much to what you will observe. Take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2010<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>joby is an awesome teacher. first paper he will grade really hard, but the midterms he grades much easier. the class is laid back and fun. definitely take him1</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2009<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow these other ratings are way off!

Got me to get to know my classmates pretty well, to think deeply. Wasn't very aware of student observation requirements and wasn't always clear about his requirements either. There was a lot of reading but you would be okay doing about half of it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2008<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joby is an AWESOME teacher! He has been one of the most influencial professors that I have had at DePaul. The reading in this class were extremely relevant, and his lectures/discussions touch on all the right topics. His class perfectly paralleled the issues I was facing in my observations in CPS. He is willing to help you out, and very understandi</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2006<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Completely awesome guy. Maybe a bit disorganized but he understands if you are the same way. Really makes class a joy to be in, even early in the morning. Always willing to help as much as he can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2005<br>Class Name: SEC363AND364<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy.  Too much going on in his personal life made him change things up a lot.  I appreciated his comments on all of my work.

Very understanding and willing to help, but also very disorganized.  Just be prepared for this, and be enthusiastic and you will enjoy his class.  Very nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2005<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the first class that gave me a realistic portrayal of life in the classroom. He is very passionate about education and will inspire you to be and do better. Not the most organized, but not the worst in terms of organization either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2004<br>Class Name: SCG761<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid him if possible.  He changed the syllabus and grading scale halfway through the course.  A real disappointment.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2004<br>Class Name: TL613<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He tried hard, but overall I would say that I got the least out of this class than ANY education class as a graduate student. It was difficult to determine exactly what he expected, b/c he was always changing the syllabus and his explanations. Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2004<br>Class Name: TL611<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2004<br>Class Name: CS488<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
