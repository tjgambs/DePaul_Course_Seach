He is used to instructing phd students, so an undergraduate course was rather experimental for him apparently. Nevertheless, he was an awesome professor who was always willing to help out and give his insight on topics. Couldn't have asked for a better professor.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2015<br>Class Name: CTH206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Stan is awesome! There are a few things that really bother him and those are texting, when you don't show up, and when you don't come prepared. If you try to make an effort he will give you an A. He is hilarious and very wise.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2015<br>Class Name: REL180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stan is a very nice guy, who is more than willing to help a struggling student. He gives extra credit opportunities to those who need it. However, you will have to do a lot of reading in this class and you cannot skim the reading. Most of this class is discussion based. The experience is very rewarding and you will learn a lot from Stan.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: REL180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ilo is awesome and an extremely funny and nice person. The midterm was a bit tough but you have other assignments to bring the grade up if you don't do well. The final Exam is a project but as long as you're creative with it you should be fine. Plus he takes the class to a restaurant at the end of the quarter. His class was an easy A. </div></div></div></body></html>
