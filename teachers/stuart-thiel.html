He inspired me to go to law school and because of his class, I was able to decide whether I thought law school was for me. I am also pretty sure his class actually helped me out a lot in my first year of law school.and he probably wrote me a pretty good letter of rec.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2007<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its too bad that Thiel is a visiting professor and is not full time faculty because this was the easiest econ class I ever took.  He curves like everyone has an F and it is almost impossible to fail.  Review sheets for all exams, attendece is optional.  Go first day, last day, and exam days and you are all good.  Just  browse through the book once.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good teacher. I took economics in high school so I already knew the material and he did nothing but confuse me. The class is rather easy though. Attendance is extremely optional (expect for weekly quizzes), and the curve is pretty crazy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No matter what the others say.

Nice teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2006<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>his teaching methods are from another world. nothing in the book matches up with what he says or quizzes you on. taking notes is pointless because the quizzes are so random. it's basically a mult-choice guessing game. you will learn nothing... take anybody else but thiel.... trust me!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>prepare to learn nothing from this class. He is a terrible, boring, teacher. He goes off on random tangents about his ex, or he will explain minor details for 20 minutes which are completely irrelevant in his stupid immature examples. He is probably the worst teacher at Depaul. Do not take him, hang yourself instead so your roomates will get A's.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Hard to follow. Doesn't respond to e-mails, and doesnt address your concerns as a student. the final is based off all of the quizes, but they come from left field, and its hard to get A's on the quizzes. I only took him because he was the only ECON class at LPC, but it was a MISTAKE! Go to the loop, worst professor I have encountered.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His quizzes are hard...but...the final (no midterm) is a breeze.  I got a 100% on it since it was all old quiz questions.  Also, the quizzes may be hard, but they are curved.  So getting an A requires some studying, but its not impossible.  He is really not a bad guy; just weird.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2006<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absent-minded, booring, and a complete slob. I would not dispute his genius or accomplishment, but he simply does a very poor job of communicating his points.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: ECO<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>um, I could not follow this guy no matter how hard I tried, he knew about economics but he would start a sentence on the topic of eco and end the same sentence with some random story about falling down...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: ECONLAW<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You must be STUPID if you do badly in his class. 40% of your grade is participation 50% is two take home mid-terms and 10% is a 10 question in class vocab final! Really it's not that much effort and you LEARN</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's totally a smart guy.  If he ever reads this, I would suggest he have his students purchase a text book to follow him along on the ride.  I had the sensation the quiz'es came out of nowhere, until I bought a $5 Micro-econ book from half.com; then I started being 6 points or so over the median.  I think he knows a lot though.  PH.d, JD, MA...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2005<br>Class Name: ECO398LAW<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is different, but very interesting. I would reccomend him, he is not difficult at all, he is very smart and knows his stuff. The midterm and final were both open book take-homes. I am coming from the standpoint of an economics major though, so 105/106 classes probably beware, he might be too hard for first-timers - take Bucci, Ownes, or Berdell.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2005<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst teacher ever! Quiz every week, that you have no idea what it is gonna be about..aviod him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of boring.  It's hard to follow him sometimes. He definitely knows his stuff it's just that he talks too much and gives some of the crappiest examples there could possible be.  The quizes are cool though because you can put in more than one answer (Albeit you can only get a half point if one of your answers is right tho)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not the worst teacher I've had. He mumbles a lot, and often goes on tangents, but basically if you go through the notes and study guides, you'll do fine on those weekly quizzes. There was one day when I fell asleep during class, and raced thru the quiz, but still got the highest score in the class. Not difficult if you try just a little.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class sucks. You have a quiz every week, and you think you understand his boring lectures and the reading assigned but his quizzes come out of nowhere. They make no sense and are practically impossible. DO NOT take him if you can help it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2005<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is the worst professor ever!  he looks like jimmy buffet and gives everyone in the class a b- and claims it's because he knows that people are reimbursed dependent upon their grade and he doesn't think everyone deserves it or something like that...just an overall ***</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of a different guy...pretty hard class and he is not very clear in his teaching methods.  The good thing was that the material is interesting and his questions provoke real deep thought and learning.  I'm split.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, I don't know what to say about him.  Basically you do NOT need to buy the book since the quizzes hardly relate to them at all.  He mumbles, switches topics at the snap of a finger, very hard to understand!  As long as you take all of the quizzes and give some effort, the minimum grade you will get is a C-. Quizzes are BRUTAL.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quiz each week and a final.Sounds easy enough, right&#63;WRONG!The quizes are hell, based only on his opinion and interpretation.The only thing that makes this class worth it is the final is all the quizes lumped into one test.So study only the quizes he gave throughout the quarter and you'll do fine on final.he does drop the 3 lowest quiz scores</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he doesn't make sense and his quizzes are harder than hell!! don't take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG, what is wrong with him. Asks the strangest questions on his quizes. I understand this subject very well and I don't understand his questions. Will contradict what he says to do in class on the quizes and expects us to know it. The grading though is very lenient. He curves A LOT, but he needs to</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expect to study your butt off and still fail all the quizzes.  It is normal.  He gives everyone atleast C- He wears the same things every class, has crazy stories, and mummbles, so sit up close to hear.  I would stay away from him and try to take another professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's really nice BUT....horrible teacher.

Yes, he mumbles. I can only surmise that those who gave this guy a bad rating are slackers.  He's one of the more knowledgable profs that depaul shouldbe proud to employ.

Just show up and listen.  He tries to be very helpful if you don't get it.  Quizzes are once a week and can be difficult, but everything is curved.  Final is based on Quizzes.  No Midterm.

Yes, he mumbles. Who cares! If you are struggling at all he is more then willing to help and is very understanding. 75% quizes, 25% final...ridiculous curves.
