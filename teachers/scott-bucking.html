I don't know how DePaul keeps him around. Very clear on what he wants and expects, helps anyone at anytime, very nice, and knows how to teach.

He only has one paper due at the end of the quarter and two tests (midterm and final). Just show up to class, pay attention, and do the readings and you'll easily pass with an A. He's also really helpful if you have any questions and is so passionate about his work.

Scott has a lot of energy, and is a blast to listen to. Class goes by very fast because he has so many interesting stories and engages the class regularly. Pay attention to study guides, take notes and your grade will be good. You do need to make an effort in studying for tests, but he is clear what you need to know.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2013<br>Class Name: HST290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Scott is a very knowledgeable, helpful, enthusiastic, kind professor. He loves what he does, and it shows. He's happy to answer any and all questions, and he's very clear about what you need to know. If you take good notes in class, you don't need to do the readings. Incredible guy; wish I could take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2013<br>Class Name: HST290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Scott is extremely knowledgeable, and incredibly passionate about archaeology and ancient Egypt. There's a midterm, lab report, and final. Very straight forward. If you pay attention in class and don't do the weekly readings you will pass. My favorite professor at DePaul. Wish I could take more classes with him, but it's not my major!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2013<br>Class Name: HIST290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I've had at DePaul so far. Excited about his subject and extremely organized. Makes the class both interesting and informative. Handled real ancient artifacts! I learned a lot and had fun. Lighthearted, witty and wonderful professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2013<br>Class Name: HST290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take his class! He is a bit jittery (pacing, not making eye contact, etc.) but is incredibly passionate about what he is teaching. You get to handle actual ancient Egyptian artifacts! Doesn't require textbooks and the readings he assigns are interesting and relevant.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: HST290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great teacher. He was always very excited and energetic about what he was teaching. My only complaint was that he had 3 grades, so if you did bad on one, most likely you'll do bad in the class. However, he was helpful if you needed it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2012<br>Class Name: HST291<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is definitely entertaining: he is all over the place and rarely makes eye contact with his students. However, he is extremely passionate about Archaeology. His class was easy and so were the midterm and final. I barely studied and got an A on both.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2012<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is amazing! trust me, take his class.

It is a fun and engaging class. It is easy, there are 2 papers, 2 tests, and one project. All of which he gives you all the help you would need. IT is a great class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2011<br>Class Name: HST290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ancient Egypt with Scott Buckling was the greatest class i have ever taken. I added a minor in archaeology simply so I could take more of his classes. He makes the class very entertaining. You will want to attend class. 1 resource worksheet, a group meeting, an artifact lab, and a 50-question midterm and final. no textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2010<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very enthusiatic. Cool guy, willing to help. The papers were also pretty easy. The bad&#63; The test is pretty hard. Study Study Study. Also IMO he's a tough grader on papers. Overall I won't recommend him, but if you do get him, this class isn't the type that will make you rip your hair out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2008<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>his class was awesome. he's really funny and doesn't require you to buy books. 1 quiz, 1 final and 1 easy paper/lab</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2008<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really enthusiastic and excited about the material, which isn't too complex and can be pretty interesting. also very helpful and the two essays (make up most of the grade) are really easy and he's an easy grader as well im pretty sure a vast majority of the class got a's</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2007<br>Class Name: HST291<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>for whoever said this professor was hot..definitely was wrong!he wears extremely tight (gray shirts) and always has pit stains. his midterm is ok.. no text book. his final is ridculous!! he makes you memorize a map with a million places and his class average was a 50%. his paper was ok but it was a lot of nonsense</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2007<br>Class Name: HST291<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His final was ridiculous, no one did good on it. it was pretty much impossible, but otherwise the class was ok.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2007<br>Class Name: HST290<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man has enough energy to light a city.  The best way to describe him would be a beastie boy on speed.  In this he can be kind of annoying.  However, he's helpful, to the point, and very nice.  You might want to take a few shots of espresso to keep up with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2007<br>Class Name: HST290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SUCH an easy professor.

I absolutely loved his class. EXTREMELY enthusiastic about his work. He outlines his lectures and uses tons of images that will appear on the midterm and final.
