You didn't have to go to class, but you can't pass the class without going.  Lots of worksheets, very few book assingments.  Only four tests plus the exam, but homework almost every day.  She is very nice, very approachable, and explains things really well.  I would reccommend her for anyone who hates math.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: ISP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Evins is amazing. She is really helpful. Her notes are really easy to take and help you stay focused in class. Shes really nice too which doesn't hurt.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2008<br>Class Name: MATH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class.  Can't say enough good things about it.  But then again I love math.  And I'd definitely hit it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows her stuff when it comes to the course work. She likes to assign partners for projects so hope you get with someone who will pull there own weight. Do the in class assignments in class and hope you can get a head start on the homework there too. Overall she has a pretty nice personality outside of the math world. Not bad to look at either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's true that she &quot;dumbs things down&quot; a little bit, but I didn't mind at all. Made the subject relevant and interesting and most of all easy to succeed in. I've taken her for two classes and would definitely take another. Pay attention in class, do the work, and there's no reason why you shouldn't get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes a very good professor! Don?t regret taking her at all. Im extremely horrible at math and dreaded taking this class, but I don?t regret it. She made everything simple and easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is such a good teacher. i really don't like math at all, but this was one math class i never wanted to miss. very interesting and useful material and she taught it very well!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2008<br>Class Name: ISP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'd hit it.

Lucid, simple, and concise. She tends to dumb things down for some students, which can get irritating, but I can see why it's necessary. The work is extremely manageable. Everything about her class is a breeze.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a class you can't really afford to miss because of in-class activities and because you have a partner that depends on you. Her lessons are not the most exciting (if you don't like math), but she tries to spice them up with real life examples and stats. She is nice, clear and helpful... good at teaching. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have no interest in the subject- take her. She makes the class as easy and painless as possible for everyone. No book to be bought, easy stuff, and she's helpful as she could be.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, very clear, and she is very helpful.

I hated math but she really made it easy to come to class and was always there to answer any of my questions.  Very good about email and making time outside of class for extra help.  Make sure to study the formulas!  Her midterm and final reflect pretty much everything learned in the course.  Go to class and do the homework!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is really easy, just make sure you pay attention to what she says.  She is definately NOT one of those teachers that's on a power trip! I sometimes have problems paying attention and it annoys teachers when i ask to repeat something, but she has no problem with it! The matieral is not that hard to being with but shes makes it even easier!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2007<br>Class Name: ISP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes okay. I took her class again for 120 so shes not too bad. I would recommend her if you don't know anything about math or are uneasy with it. I know a lot about it but I wanted a blowoff class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice and helpful, i hated math but she helped me understand it.

I would not have made it without her. Sometimes a bit weird, treated us like little kids, but very ncie and unquestionably fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I HATED THIS TEACHER. ISP 120 is a hard class to begin with and having her as a teacher makes it even worse. She is SO unfair and grades horribly. She treats everyone like children and everytime I walk into that class I want to SLAP HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2005<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cathy is one of the best teacher's I've had at DePaul.  She makes math very understandable for those of us who are intimadated by it.  I think everyone who has a chance to have her should take advantage of it, you won't be sorry.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2005<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy.

It's a big class which made is hard for her explain everything in depth.  Class sucked but she tried to make it interesting.  However, the final is almost impossible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: MATH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am pretty sure she is Alanis Morrisette. She also is a good teacher.

She knows how to teach the class well and reach out to students who are not so good at math. She is cool with you coming to her for help on homework. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2004<br>Class Name: ISP110ITHINK<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a good teacher. Very organized, and the class was pretty easy. The only thing is, she graded homeowrk, and graded it pretty hard, it brought down many people's grades. The tests and quizzes were very easy though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2004<br>Class Name: ISP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Math is not my thing, but this class was way easier than i thought it'd be.
