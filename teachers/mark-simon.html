If you take him for forensics you will be shocked this man can even operate a computer. If you can make it to the class to complete his useless assignments you will become one of the few, the proud, the group of people smarter than mark simon, everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: CNS320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Waste of time and instructor knows NOTHING about the topic!!! Save your money and read a children's book instead. At least that would be somewhat beneficial.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2010<br>Class Name: CNS320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's really unfortunate that DePaul would allow someone so unfamiliar with computers to teach a computer forensics class. Mark seems baffled by the material he is teach, and also fairly inept at teaching. He talks EXTREMELY slow and although I was someone who was extremely enthusiastic about the class, I felt that I had no choice but to drop.</div></div></div></body></html>
