The tests are not extremely difficult, if you do the homework and attend class. I bought the book, but openned it up twice, so you don't really need it. But you do, need his printouts though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2010<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher.
