I wouldn't recommend it for full-time students. She expects you to put 12 hours a week into her projects and doesn't always give a clear grading rubric. To be honest, I didn't really learn much from this class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2014<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Paola was a generally helpful and kind professor in class and was approachable for most questions. Though she required a great amount of external supplies for the course to be used for border-line meticulous and pretentious assignments, which was surprising and annoying for an intro art class. I absolutely do not recommend her for this course. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2014<br>Class Name: ART218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She jokes that this class is like a gym class because it honestly is. It's challenging in that you're quickly sketching a person for the entire class period with only two or three minor breaks. It's intense, but you do learn solid proportions. Only take this course if you're serious about drawing, otherwise it's overwhelming.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2014<br>Class Name: ART115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a lot of work. I had to consistently come in on weekends to work on projects, which most of the other students did too. The projects were a bit challenging for an intro. class, but I did enjoy it. If you are not artistic or really into art, stay away from this class. Paola was cool too, but she did expect a lot/professional work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2013<br>Class Name: ART218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are majoring in art, and really passionate about it, take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2013<br>Class Name: ART218<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She expects you to commit to the class, but that doesn't mean a whole lot. Never skip, have all your materials, do the assignments early, and you're golden.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/08/2013<br>Class Name: ART218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My class with her was figure drawing 1 over summer. She's very relaxed, and she makes her expectations clear from the beginning. Just go to class and do the projects and as far as I can tell that's all you need for a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: ART113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She Never gives out grades which makes you feel lost. Her comments often have to do with her own opinion rather than the project guidelines. She NEVER sticks to the guidelines. You can really do whatever you want in this class as long as you a brown noser. Most people didn't follow directions but kissed her A, which she likes. Pointless class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2011<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's the best art teacher I've ever had. I'm an artist, but Paola intorduced me to techniques that I've never used before! And she's super chill, kind of hippy. Don't take this class if you expect an easy work load, it's definitely an intense class (for beginning drawing.)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2011<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is really interesting, but she gives a lot of work.  She really really knows her stuff, but some of her policies are asinine.(-3% if you come 5 minutes late).  But take her if you want to experience a well versed studio class.  Just get on her good side and youll be fine.</div></div></div></body></html>
