    It was so easy. The only hard assignment was the final paper. Homework assignments were journals where we'd write about the game of Go. Class attendance is mandatory.

    This is genuinely one of the most caring professors I've ever had. He not only wants you to do well in his class but throughout your academic career. He writing assignments are a bit extensive but thats because he doesn't believe in tests! He's a wonderful professor and man in general and I high recommend taking his courses.

    Sundermeier is a great guy, he knows what he's talking about. However, I think he tends to forget that this is a fairly new topic for students. He tries to use video clips, stories, and fun examples to help his students understand what he's talking about but doesn't connect the topic to the examples very well.

    He is such an awesome professor. He is really laid back and tells great stories. There is a lot of work, but it honestly helps you understand the material. The tests are not hard if you use his lecture outlines and study guide. Lots of discussion keeps lectures at a minimum and makes class time go by quickly. Such a great guy.

    I LOVE professor Sundermeier! His class was so interesting and engaging, and his personality was amazing! Attendance is not mandatory, which can be plus but honestly his funny personality made me come to class almost always! I do have to say his tests can be challenging but just make sure you study carefully and you'll be fine.

    Take Him!!  Not only is cognitive science an interesting topic but Sundermeier makes it even more so.  Claims the midterm/final is hard, but if you study the study guide using his tips you'll do fine.  He includes funny anecdotes and shows videos of how he trained his cat to do tricks. Also very helpful during office hours if you need help.

    Favorite professor at DePaul so far (and I've had many excellent ones).He makes everyone feel so comfortable in his class by breaking up lectures with hillarious personal stories. Exams cover a lot, but there are no tricks. He WANTS everyone to get A's and is very helpful.You learn so much and don't even realize it- take him... you won't regret it!

    He doesnt pick enemies. He does tell interesting stories. But this is a fairly tough class. The readings can be dense. He does grade assignments somewhat harshly. The tests are fairly hard. He covers a lot and it's hard to remember everything that was taught. If you do take him, you wont lose sleep but you will have to put in work. I've had tougher

    Personally,  I am not a great test taker. If you can relate, you'll do great! He gives out 20 quizzes and 5 reflection papers. There is NO MIDTERM/FINAL. Read the required readings and listen in class. If you do that, you'll do just fine in the class. Oh, and did I mention he gives a retake option for every quiz&#63;! Yeah!

    20 quizzes, one for every class period. you read prior to class, he lectures on the reading and take quiz at the end of class which you can grade on your own at the end of class bc he has the answers. he explains well for the most part and can be strange at times, but who isn't. you can get an easy a if you read, the readings are about 20 pgs.

    I liked Sundermeier well enough. He's a very funny and interesting person, with a knack for making lectures enjoyable. I don't feel that he picked favorites, but I DO feel that he picked enemies. The material is dense and can be difficult, as are the tests. Success is possible, but take this course with caution. It will demand time.

    I didn't like the way this class was formatted/taught. Sundermeier is a cool guy but as far as teaching goes I didn't feel like I could understand him. He picks favorites and seems to give them an easier time than the rest of the class. I wouldn't advise taking- course material is hard and incomprehensible.

    Terrible Prof. He makes everything much more difficult and if you ask him for extra help or extra credit he is useless and typically rude. He really has no business teaching.

    The class was incredibly easy. The tests were straightforward and the questions looked exactly like the homework. One homework asst per week, no textbook. The work load was minimal and he always had funny stories to share. He's probably the most helpful professor ever, he'll even help you during the test. Great professor for a stats class.

    He seemed like he knew what he was talking about, but couldn't quite project it to students very well. I learned out of the book a lot, and if you don't want to be confused in class, I recommend you do the same. Like I said, not the worst, but certainly not the easiest to learn from.

    Interesting class but really difficult if you are not already familiar with the subject. He doesn't always explain things very well and can be a bit rude at times, but he's generally a nice and pretty funny guy. Grades VERY strictly on tests, which are all essay format. There is no text book but expect hw due every class!

    a nice guy, but a HORRIBLE teacher! worst class of my life. he is a psych professor teaching math...NO! he probably should just stick to psych. this class should have been an easy A, but i struggled the whole time because of his way of teaching.

    Teacher teaches the subject great and paced. Offers proper review of last class's material before moving on. Tests are a mix of MC and SA. He grades the HW and Tests mildly hard but compensates with HUGE curves on tests if class average sucks (we had a 16% curve on first test). Class is all HW and TESTS. other than that, he is a great teacher!
