His courses are tough but I learned IMMENSELY.  He is quite humorous too - he will turn boring (yet essential) topics into dynamic conversations.  Take him - you will not regret it! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2014<br>Class Name: MPS541<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Homework assignments are very hard but he's very helpful and replies in almost minutes if you email.

Ask questions and go to him during office hours.

He knows the ins and outs of Chicago politics and really made the class fun even for those who came in with little knowledge on the subject. He will challenge you, but he is fair and will always give good constructive criticism. Definitely would not mind taking another class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Luby is a good instructor. This was his first year (quarter) teaching undergraduate students, and this was in the context of a freshmen year "Explore" class. Has high expectations for his students, in terms of preparedness and professionalism, but provided good insight into university expectations overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Luby is a great teacher. Taking his "how the city that works works" class was a great decision. He gets you interested in chicago style politics as well as global politics. Lots of reading in the class that really helps on the tests. Loves class participation so make sure you speak up a lot.</div></div></div></body></html>
