What she is looking for in assignments are extremely vague, but if you don't put down what she wants to hear you will get deducted. She rambles off topic a lot, which is a good waste of class time but she guilt trips the class on occasion. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Miritello is an EXCELLENT professor. She honestly cares about her students and wants them to succeed. Energetic little woman, who just wants to improve you as a writer. Very understanding & willing to help. Many extended deadlines, assignments are a bit vague but you get out of the course what you put in. Earned  90+ on all of my papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is extremely helpful if asked a question outside of class; however, she can be blunt if you underestimate her kindness. Journal entries after each lecture determine most of your grade. Be sure to do most of the readings and participate somewhat and it's an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The cutest old lady I ever met. I found myself smiling all class because of how adorable she was. I wish this was my mom. She is really understanding if you just ask questions and do decent work you should get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is honestly the worst professor I have had at DePaul. We did not learn anything about how to write a research paper and were just expected to know. She does not give any helpful comments on papers. She says vague things such as "write with more of your voice" or "frame your ideas better" but gives no helpful suggestions. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the cutest old person you will ever meet. I wish she was my grandma too! Sometimes, her homework assignments are straight up busy work, but she is super helpful when the assignments get harder. I highly recommend her to first year students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2012<br>Class Name: ENGLI1288<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved having her as a teacher! She is always happy to be in class and gets off on random tangents and ends up telling stories.  I wish she was my grandma! My favorite teacher and class of my first quarter of college and would definitely recommend taking her. Usually doesn't have too high of expectations and is very helpfull.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2007<br>Class Name: ENG200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is sooo happy to be in class with her students and tells the stupidest stories but she really is such a cute lady! She must read all the novels cover to cover in order to pass her pop quizzes and write the papers well. The novels are pretty interesting so its not too diffucult to read. Very sweet lady and easy class only if u read!! Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2007<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher, easy class but reading the material and attending class is mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2007<br>Class Name: AMN265<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this professor. I was struggling at first but then I went and discussed my issues with her and on my final essay i got a 99 and an A on the final. Take her very sweet lady she is passionate and entergetic. Expects you to read if you do not read you will fail.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love her!  We had to read 4 novels in 10 weeks, 6 pop quizzes (50pts each), midterm/final, and an 8pg paper.  A lot of reading and writing is involved, but it is so worth what you get out of the class.  Keep up with readings and you will pass with at least a B.  This is the 2nd time I have taken her, and passed both courses with an A.  Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely a high school style class. I felt dumber everytime I left that class. Attendance IS mandatory, and not because her lectures are important, but because she thinks they are. I'm piss I wasted money on this class. Quizes are essay style as is final&midterm, plus final paper. BIG WASTE OF TIME. she also plays favorites and does not hide it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2006<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is HIGHSCHOOL stuff, just read what she assigns and show up to class, she does NOT assign too much, it is all short stories for gods sake. She is really loopy and annoying as hell at first, but then you realize she is just sweet and passionate about English. EASY GRADER, if you just say something thoughtful and &quot;profound&quot; she will praise you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2006<br>Class Name: ENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher, but there were way too many questions raised by the teacher concerning the readings that were pointless. Just because an author uses the word &quot;stone&quot; four times in a text does not mean that there was a purpose in so doing outside of its contextual use. Not very available outside of class, but helpful none-the-less.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very sweet lady, but don't let that decieve you this is not a class you can be lazy in.There is a lot of reading and at times she assigns too much reading in a short amount of time, but as long as you read carefully, you should be fine.Quizes midterm and final are essay form.Be prepared to read and write a lot in this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Miritello is a very energetic woman. She has a passion for literature and hopes to instill the same into all of her students. There are quite a few readings--essential to your success in the class. YOU HAVE TO READ! Everything except an 8pg paper is written in class. Quizzes(50pts), midterm/final(100pts). Good class/professor--I would take again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2006<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the easier professors at DePaul, but the class is still very interesting. Basically a guaranteed &quot;A&quot; if you just read the material and show some ineterest in class. I cannot over-state how easy this class is... Will take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was one of my favorite teachers. All you need to do is do the reading and attend class. The readings are all short and not very difficult. Just apply yourself and show you care about the material and you will be fine. Quizzes and Tests are very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This lady is very sweet and she genuinly cares about her students. She wants you to get better and learn. She will comment on all of your quizzes, tests, etc. The quizzes are pretty hard and it is a lot to do in an hour but time yourself accordingly. But be prepared if you have her for only an hour, the quiz will be VERY difficult to finish....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't understand how anyone could dislike this professor.  Super nice and an easy grader; she was decent enough to thoroughly discuss with me the only paper I did poorly on and then offer suggestions to improve it.  Good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just do the reading and come to class, she was one of my favorite teachers at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: READINGLIT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST TEACHER I'VE HAD SO FAR. and i had man who thought he was God... she plays favorites and if are not one of those she will make you feel like you should crawl in a hole... not very approachable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible. horrible. horrible. a glorified secretary who one day was allowed to teach. a terrible day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful professor. She can be a little dramatic, but if you can get over that you will have no problem.  All you have to do is read the material and go to class, she practically feeds everything to you.

She is too into the material, and the grading shows. Although I didn't keep up with the reading, still was much harder than I expected.
