CFO, real world experience, expects his class to be run like a work meeting with meaningful discussion by all.  Wish all professors at DePaul taught like Prof Hollingsworth.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: FIN526<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I've had at DePaul.  Tons of real world experience and relates the topics to real examples.  Paces the class well and you learn a lot.  The material is not easy, but you know what to expect on the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2012<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best FIN teacher I had at DePaul (thats not saying much unfortunately).  The whole semester he was using real life examples to hit home the lessons.  Ex. we spent 2 weeks in groups coming up for a valuation for Facebook during the time of its IPO using lessons he taught us.  Easy going guy who is NOT boring.  Logical, practicle.  Highly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2011<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him. I guarantee you won't regret.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2011<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are looking for a class that is taught by a CFO with real life experience this is the class for you.  The class passes quickly & there is group work in class.  Take good notes, as what is discussed in class is more important than what is in the text. This class is very useful if you want to learn how stocks are valued.</div></div></div></body></html>
