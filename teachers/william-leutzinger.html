    Really laid back guy. Class was pretty fun to go to, and it particularly focuses on the business side of telecommunications (not saying there isn't any theory involved, because there is). Quizzes are open notes and the final is take home. Also you have to do a presentation on a topic of your choice with certain specifications. Take him!

    Incredible professor.  The spectacular part about Bill is that you actually learn an absurd amount in this class without even realizing it.  He is working in the field, incredibly knowledgeable and explains everything perfectly.    Quizzes are open note and final is take home. This class is a must take.

    Bill is a really cool laid back, relaxed kind of guy. His quizzes are open notes (so write what he says in the lecture to get an "A" on the quizzes). He brings in speakers to give you a viewpoint of the "real world". There are no breaks but lets you out early. His midterm is easy if you study the study guide and the final is take-home. Take him.

    Best professor I have ever seen.Provides real world knowledge rather than sticking to the book only.
