    This class was very interesting. Renata is a great professor and goes through the slides thoroughly. This class is taught both by Renata and Paul. Study the slides and read the book to get a good grade on the midterm and final.

    This class covered the systems development life cycle and covers the concepts of project management.  50% of the class is a project (good team members are key) and 50% is the midterm and final.  Read her lecture slides prior to class and get some background from the book.  With the right group and a little effort, you can get an A.
