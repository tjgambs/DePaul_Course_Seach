I feel that he talks about a single item for wayyyy too long. I feel the information should be talked about broadly first, and then gone into specifics. Instead he talks about very fine details and intermittently goes into broad concepts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2013<br>Class Name: IT231<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is helpful but misses out on some fine tuning. he makes adjustments in class and unless you have had experience with programming it will be a big challenge. He expects people to follow him but you may get lost very fast.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: IT231801<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is very easy A. Don't expect learn more. However, he is very helpful with homework and all homework comes from his lectures and PowerPoint.</div></div></div></body></html>
