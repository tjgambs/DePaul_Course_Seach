He's rude, arrogant, not helpful and despite saying he's passionate about the subject he appears miserable teaching.  While my class was overall pretty good with participation, the few times that a discussion started to lull he would flip out on the class.  He is not understanding at all if you have any issues.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2013<br>Class Name: CTH205<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was one of the hardest I've taken at DePaul. That being said, the professor does an okay job at making the difficult material accessible. That's all the good I can say about him though. He is very arrogant and at times can be downright mean to students. Exams and papers are graded very harshly with minimal comments. I cant recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2013<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't know what to expect, but I think he is the best kept secret at Depaul!  I am definitely going to take his class next quarter.  I never thought I would like religion, but am thinking about it becoming my major.  He is really into the material and knows it so well.  I don't understand why  everone thinks he is arrogant. He was really nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very rude and arrogant. There was a lot reading and he goes over little of it and expects you to figure the rest out yourself for the tests which are essay. Not a fair grader/does care for students' success. You don't have to participate in class, just sit in the back and zone out and you'll do just as well as the students who participate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2013<br>Class Name: REL103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly save yourself and don't take this class. I never write reviews for this site but I absolutely have to for this guy.  He is EXTREMELY rude to his students, requires a ridiculous amount of readings that are very hard to understand.  He grades impossibly hard on his tests and they all require 4 essays that he never tells you about in advance</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2012<br>Class Name: CAT101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was great. Learned so much from him. He really knows his stuff and finds many realistic ways to connect to life. Young but wise. Great teacher! Favorite class! He teaches theology and is strict but he really gets you to learn if you are willing to work at it and study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2012<br>Class Name: REL213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy really gets into early christian theology.  he loves what he does and although he didn't turn me into a major or anything, I thought his class was one of my new favorites.  he is passionate, extremely knowledgeable, nice after class, and tries to make it interesting and relateable.  Overall, I was surprised how much I liked the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2012<br>Class Name: CTH243<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The MOST boring class I have ever taken in my life... All he does is lecture and he thinks he is by far the smartest person. Very rude, and gets aggrivated when people dont participate in his BORING class. I WOULD NEVER recommend this teach unless you are willing to die of boredom. The quizzes are easy, test are short answer. Take homefinal (essay)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: CTH205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Very Very boring. You have to read the readings for the quiz, but they were written in the dark ages and are so confusing. Nothing in that class made sense.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: REL213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a fantastic teacher! He is smart, passionate about his subject, and tries to help.  Yes, his class is a challenge, but why are you here is you dont want to be challenged&#63;  Teh exams are easy if you read. he is very clear and helps explain difficult material.  I went to his office hours and he was very helpful in explaining things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: CTH205<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lets see... subject matter is archaic, uninteresting and completely useless. Tests consist of mindless memorization of what a few theologians said thousands of years ago. And to top it all off, he can be very rude. Definitely not worth 2.5k in my humble opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2011<br>Class Name: CTH206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He may come off as very arrogant, but he knows his stuff. He's really helpful and reviews what you learned from the previous class at the beginning of every lecture. Make sure you keep up on reading because there's quizzes. Midterm and final aren't bad, just make sure you study the study guide. He'll also make some funny jokes during class, too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2011<br>Class Name: CATH205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, confident, intelligent guy. He gets frustrated when no one participates. A lot of reading, but every once in a while it's possible to get away with not reading. The quizzes are hard only if you haven't read. If you're not interested in the subject matter, it's a little bit harder. However, he tries to make things easy to understand</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2011<br>Class Name: REL213<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take class unless you are religious. Very boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2010<br>Class Name: REL213<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was not an easy one by far but it was very interesting. We had readings each week and they had a ton of information that was difficult to understand. He would explain everything we read in class. Tests were easy, just looking to see if we read really. Midterm and Final were four essays. You learn a lot but have to work hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2010<br>Class Name: REL110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really good guy who obviously likes what he's teaching. He isn't an easy grader though. He grades for intro classes like they're 300 level.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: REL110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Solid teacher. If you show up to class and participate, you will do well on the midterm and final exam. You do have to read a lot but he doesn't expect you to understand it all because he goes over it the next class. He really is a nice guy and if you do the readings, you will do well on the weekly quizes. Overall, I really enjoyed the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2010<br>Class Name: REL110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOTS of reading. Quiz every week on blackboard. Abstract material. SO MUCH INFORMATION. But fairly easy because literally everything you discuss in class is on the tests. I NEVER read but went to almost every class and got 87 on midterm. He's passionate about what he teaches & tries to make it interesting. pretty good professor & nice guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2010<br>Class Name: REL115<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never Ever Take this Class!!!!! You will have hours (I mean at least six hours) of readings each week! Then you will have to take a quiz on Blackboard each week- on the readings! No one in the class understands what is going on at all! The prof. is so monotone you will zone out hard core! Seriously Never Take this class! You dont even learn anythin</div></div></div></body></html>
