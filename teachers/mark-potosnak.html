    Dr. Potosnak is honestly a great professor. His lectures can be a little dry at times, but he has a wonderful sense of humor and is one of the most passionate professors I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. He just loves his job and his subject of teach and it shows-and pays off.

    Mr. P is super helpful and funny! The lectures are interesting and he ties in current events and videos to make class interesting. There is one main group project that you work on throughout the term with checkpoints so it doesn't seem rushed. He's always there for you if you need help too. A very enjoyable class, I'd take it again! :)

    Mark is a great professor... There are usually either people who are knowledgeable on the subject matter but suck as a teacher, or people who are great teachers but suck on the subject matter. Mark is knowledgeable and knows how to teach. He creates a fun environment that makes going to class a pleasure. The only complaint is how is the course is.

    Overall a really nice guy, but not my favorite professor. Biggest complaint is that he does not do a thorough job of explaining things sometimes. Even after asking him direct questions, students tended to remain confused. On the plus side, this fostered a good community among students since we had to help each other out so much.

    Grades very slowly and unfairly. Does not specify why he is taking off points. Picks favorites. Over-simplifies in lecture, and tests are ridiculous. Did not teach me much. Butchered science. This class is bs. He is very late handing in grades I don't even know what I got on anything past the halfway point of the class and it's a week after finals.

    Potosnak is super nice, helpful and funny. Class was very enjoyable and rewarding. Attendance is mandatory - although it is a great way to boost your grade and keep it high. Weekly iclicker quizzes from the reading. Buy the text online (MUCH cheaper!) If you need a SciQuant - TAKE HIM!! No math on quizzes &amp; tests (just HW + final project).

    He's a nice guy, funny in subtle way. Quizzes on reading, homework once a week, midterm and final have some multiple choice, but is mostly short answer with an essay question. If I had to take another science class, I would want him as my prof, choose him.
