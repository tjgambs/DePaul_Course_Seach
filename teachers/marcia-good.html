Her lectures also don't teach you anything. Avoid taking her if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is nice but She doesn't grade anything, i've been done with the class for 3 weeks and haven't received my grade for anything but the first HW. The assignments are fairly easy however they are almost unending. She expects students to spend an unrealistic amount of time doing assignments outside of class, more than any other class i've taken. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: SOC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is knowledgeable about the course and she is really passionate about helping the students learn. Now we go downhill, she thinks that her course is the only course students are taking and then she penalizes hard for not showing up to class and if you disagree with her about your grade or anything of that sort forget about it…do not take her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2014<br>Class Name: ANTHRO360<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really nice and very knowledgable about the material. She wants people to spend their weekends doing blog like discussion board questions and the discussion broad criteria is never put up on time. She is quite disorganized over all and do not expect grades at all. Not much guidance on research paper either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: ANT360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class organization can be a bit messy and difficult for this professor, but she is an amazing woman with truly fascinating life experiences.  She really cares about people (her students) and is excited to engage them.  She expects high output so avoid if looking for an easy elective. Very inspiring woman.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2014<br>Class Name: ANT360<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Let me be honest, this is a course you can pass. However, this is a teacher that forgets you have 3 other classes, is offended if you aren't as fascinated about women's bodies, is unorganized, and will never grade you. OH, and expects people stay in on Saturdays to post discussion posts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice person. The only thing is she is very unorganized and doesn't grade anything. This class has a lot of work you have to do, its easy work but A LOT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2013<br>Class Name: ANT105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is extremely unorganized and  was unclear on directions for the term project. She also gave far too much work that often times did not relate to what we were doing in class. Her lectures were rushed and after we would watch a movie that had nothing to do with her lecture. Disappointed with this course</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2013<br>Class Name: ANTH102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a rewarding course. She is very approachable and friendly. The stories she tells are appropriate and add to the course. The quizzes and final were open book/take home and she gives plenty of opportunity for extra credit if you take the time. I would take more courses with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take her unless you can commit at least two hours to this class..required to go to many neighborhoods, great experience but just too time consuming..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2012<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was talking about herself instead of teaching anthropology. But she is a nice lady and knows her stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She gives too much work for a introduction class. We had to read the chapter everyday and she would quiz on it and on top of that she would assigned us articles and give pop quiz. Midterm was part essay, based on the movies we watched in class, part multiple choice and short answer. Final is take home.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2012<br>Class Name: SS200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unbelievable. Way too much work. Unorganized. Unhelpful. Her expectations of how much you can get done in a week show a preposterous disregard for other responsibilities one might have in their life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher. Very motivating and very involved, but very demanding too.  You can get an A but you will have to work for it. Assigns things to do all the time.  She won’t give you a brake at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: ANT105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Alright here's the deal. I had her for anthropology through film and hated the class. Not just because I dont like the subject but because I thought it was supposed to be easy (which it should being a 100 level class) and it wasnt. She is a good teacher for anthro students and that's it. everyone else will hate her class. Dont take her for an easyA</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2011<br>Class Name: ANT105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Possibly the worst professor I've encountered at Depaul. Completely unorganized. Amount of work outside of class is ridiculous. Plan on spending at least 10-15 hours a week doing busy work like discussion posts (min. 2 pages). Midterm + Final + Term Project. Would not complement this professor in any aspect.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a nice professor. She really knows the material well and she always keeps the class interactive. Very easy class, her grading system is sort of wacky but it's really hard to fail her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2011<br>Class Name: ANT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of work for a 100 level class but I found everything we did very interesting. She has experienced so much in her life and I liked hearing all of her stories. Grading system was a little confusing and I never knew where I stood but I ended up with a B+ so I was fine. Besides that she is very clear and straightforward about what she wants.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: ANT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a caring teacher, she even gives you her cell phone number if you're having trouble getting the online quizzes for each chapter to work (incase the quiz freezes). Her lectures are very interesting and the work load isn't bad. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very quirky in her own way but she is very easy. True you may have to do a little bit of outside work but considering the class has no textbook and no written exam, I'll take it. She is a bit disorganized but overall, she is very nice and knows the material well. I would def take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a very hard class. But it is true that you will have to do quite a bit of work outside class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a nice person.  I do like her class, well the subject.  What I do not like is how she is unorganized.  Things can be confusing after time.  After all, she was available most of the time, which I thought is a good thing.  I would say, take the class, but be prepared to do a lot of extra-curricular activities that are required.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's so nice and I like her a lot as a person, but she's kind of disorganized as a teacher. I had no idea what my grades were for the entire quarter, because she never updated the gradebook after the first assignment and never handed anything back either. Nice lady though, and she was extremely easy to reach outside of class which was nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2010<br>Class Name: ANT105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As an anthropology major I am not a fan of Professor Good. She was teaching outdated material and theories. The amount of work and her expectations for a one hundred level anthropology class were really unreasonable. Such a shame because she is really sweet - just didn't have it together.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of a boring class but interesting material. Very nice lady, just a bit out there.  Has a group project that you present at the end of the quarter that requires a little bit of out of class work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2010<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor, cares about her students, cares about the material, and it all shows.  Always has something interesting to say, and makes it easy for you to get a good grade.  I wish there were more profs like this at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2010<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her winter quarter and it was a breeze. Buy the book, all the quizzes and most of the exam material is on there. The group project was a joke. Do the enrichment articles because they really help your grade. She is super nice and understanding so it's hard not for anyone to pass that class. Overall, easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Dr. Good! I loved her lectures, very interesting. But a lot of time is needed for the readings and outside ethnography projects.  Nothing you can't handle tho</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2010<br>Class Name: ANT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is terrible.  So much busy work.  Someho gets away with teaching any about 30 minutes in a three hour class.  the rest, group work, movies, time wasters.  A lot of work, but i didnt learn much.  she does return emails and works hard for her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2009<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher. She would always respond to emails and if you had any questions. The quizzes were a pain, but she gives a large amount of enrichment points. I learned a lot by taking the class. There is a lot a lot of work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2009<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Good is a good professor who has reasonable expectations and sets attainable goals.

She's fairly disorganized and continously misunderstands students' comments and then gets upset.  Honestly, her class was the worst one I've ever taken in the anthro department.  If you want a medical anthropology prof, look to Dr. Mazzeo.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2009<br>Class Name: ANTRO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved her! She's super understanding and nice to everyone! Quizzes are weekly but most of them are online so you can use your book! she gives PLENTY of extra credit opportunities... there is no possible way someone could do bad in this class.

DO THEM! its basically the whole exam!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DrGood, has got to be one of the nicest professors i've ever had. she wants you to succeed and gives you her cell phone number if you ever have any questions or problems with anything. shes definately one of the best professors at depaul!her course is very straight forward, and even if you miss work she has extra credit at the end to make up for it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DrGood, has got to be one of the nicest professors i've ever had. she wants you to succeed and gives you her cell phone number if you ever have any questions or problems with anything. shes definately one of the best professors at depaul!her course is very straight forward, and even if you miss work she has extra credit at the end to make up for it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2009<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Good is easy, nice, and helpful.

You have to keep up with readings as she quizes everyweek online, but the ethnography project is easy and she grades most of the work easily. She is a good teacher and her class is interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2009<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think she is a great professor.

She gives quizzes before the lecture, but the midterm and final are extremely easy. If anything, I'd take the class simply because the material doesn't hold back and you will learn a lot.

Just gets you thinking enough but doesn't ask too much of you. Reading is necessary for quizzes but isn't too much. She is awesome in that she has some great life experiences in diff. settings to draw from. take anthropology with her--she is the bomb!!! fun class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2008<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
