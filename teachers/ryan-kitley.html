The class was so much fun. Everyone knew everyone's names, he did such a great job of explaining what he wanted you to do and creating a comfortable environment for you to put yourself out there (which you DO have to do, it's the point of the class). I'm taking his next class because I enjoyed this one so much. Plus, only 1 paper!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2014<br>Class Name: PRF380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Ryan is a great. Professor. I love theatre and acting, and he really helped me brush up and improve my skills. I only wish that he taught another class for non-majors. He teaches acting classes at other places in the city and I plan on taking another course with him outside of DePaul. Seriously, he is great. Take him!</div></div></div></body></html>
