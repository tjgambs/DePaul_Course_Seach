Always looks for a chance to discuss things with students. Tells fantastic stories. Also, he runs an old-school set of class rules.

He was passionate about the subject, and really wanted his students to learn. He was calm, very explanatory and emotional, and his class is one that I will NEVER forget.  He is awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2013<br>Class Name: AMS395<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Brask is pretty cool and very laid back. His associate prof, Bob, is also very sweet. The fact that both of them were Vietnam Vets really added to the quality of the class. You can't learn some of the things they shared from a book or video. Reviews from 10/5/10 are crazy! Yes, you go off "topic" but it all connects. I recommend this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST PROFESSOR EVERRRR.

He can be a little scatter brained at times but overall he is knows what he is talking about. Highly recommend this class if you have any interest in the Vietnam War or war in general.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2011<br>Class Name: HISTINTN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Having earned a degree in &quot;the other&quot; BS, I thought my experience would transfer. He was the first instructor I was completely unable to snow with my silver tongue (or silver PEN, as it were). He knew exactly what I had studied. Even with borrowed notes and a peripheral understanding of what he wanted he saw right through me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2011<br>Class Name: POL106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Brask is one of the most inspired professors that you will ever have. He may seem to divert from topic but it is all for a greater good. He relates theory to real-world, real life. His classes are tough but the reward is worth it. Any naysayers couldn't get with the program!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2011<br>Class Name: AMS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor and a genuinely good human being.

Jim was not only a great teacher but also a great friend. He taught me to think and be divergent. His vocabulary is very impressive and sometimes leaves you behind but will let you catch up if you ask questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, has alot of insight about the Vietnam war and President Kennedy.  All previous that say that he is not a American hero should be ashamed of themselves for even bring up such a topic on this type of a website.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2010<br>Class Name: LSP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brask did a number of things which made me lose respect for him. 1) got the course name and number wrong on the syllabus 2) the total grades on the syllabus added up to more than 100% 3) and he fail to submit grades on time and admitted that he had no intention of actually the classes essays</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2010<br>Class Name: LSP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone who finds this man inspirational or &quot;an American hero&quot; must not value education. No one learns anything from him. While I will admit, he is a comedian I was not looking to listen to stories unrelated to the classes topic for three hours. He didn't even turn grades in on time and the deans are actually willing to pay for me to retake this</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2010<br>Class Name: LSP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want an easy class where you will learn nothing, take professor Brask. The deans here are ashamed of him and if he did not have 10 year there is no doubt that he would not be teaching. If a wanted to hear was stories I could have called up my uncle for free. Brask does not care about teaching or his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2010<br>Class Name: LSP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Actually, I am one of those freshman referenced in the last review. I did pass, only I received a C. However, the only essay graded by Brask was returned to me with a solid A and no comments. I have talked to the deans about him and they apologized for my experience and insisted that Brask was NOT a reflection on academics at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: AMS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a genuine friggin' American hero. Ignore the freshmen who gave him bad rating because they were too stupid to pass LSP 101. If you want to be actually be changed by a professor, get to know Dr. Brask.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: LSP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The test was not easy!

Really easy going, cool guy. Final is very simple and review covers everything. Has a million interesting Vietnam stories for anyone willing to listen. One of the more interesting profs at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2009<br>Class Name: POLI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Brask is wonderful. I had him for about ten classes at barat college and graduated in 2002. If I could I would take any class he would let me sit in now. My favs were the Vietnam war which I took twice once as a freshman and once as a senior for grad credit, I enjoyed  the Kennedy class. The guest speakers that dr brask was able to bring in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2009<br>Class Name: PSC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>James Brask is the best professor I have had ...ever.

Knows his history, and a great professor for night class. His Vietnam stories were really cool! Very little work is required--simply show up and take a few notes and you'll be fine. Class is focused more on the assassination than his presidency. A must take for all history majors!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy is awesome. i had him for kennedy presidency and it was one of the best classes i've ever taken. he will keep you interested for an entire night class and usually we were let out by 8:15. tells you crazy stories from vietnam and goes off on hilarious and ridiculous tangents. take him if you get the chance to!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him!

Maybe 'cause he's ex-Barat&#63; His class was small, felt more like a seminar. He always to any material and related it to the present situation of the world, and sounded poetic in his explanations and anecdotes. He's a great professor; I wish I had found him sooner!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2005<br>Class Name: VIETNAMWAR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Brask's courses are not just classes, but experiences, man! He combines effective lectures with guest speakers and the papers aren't too tough. While getting lower than a B is fairly unusual, think: Vietnam vets teaching you about the war in VN, from many perspectives- Invaluable! Discussion is always ongoing in and out of the classroom.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: VIETNAMWAR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE DR.
