He works hard to make his courses fun and inspirational.  It is obvious that he cares about his students.  I've taken one of his online courses and one of his courses on campus--both were educational and enjoyable.  His on campus courses include lots of group work--be prepared!  Highly Recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: POLITICSINCHI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nick did the unthinkable and actually sparked my interest in a topic that I thought I'd never like: Politics. Seeing how passionate he is about what he teaches is truly inspiring, and it made me interested because he was so interested. Wonderful teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: MPS594<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>This class was very intriguing. I walked away with a different perspective of my "ethical approach to life". The highlight of the class was Nick's high energy.  He was always willing to provide additional guidance on assignments and understanding of the coursework. He ensured that it was a friendly learning environment and I would def recommend students take a course with him at least once!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: MPS594<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Nick does a great job teaching a difficult topic. The class discussions are interesting and engaging and there's real value to be gained if you're willing to be open, share your values, and have those values challenged by peers. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: MPS594<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just finished taking MPS 594 with Nick. He is really good at relating the material to things in everyday life.  Nick encourages participation and has a passion for ethical leadership.  If you keep up with the readings and go class you will do great.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His Windy City Politics freshman seminar was a really enjoyable class. Basically all you need to do is pay attention to his lectures and look over the PPTs before a quiz (which he will tell you about) and you're bound to get a high A. Quizzes & exams super easy. He's really connected in the city and got us some great field trips. Team paper at end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2014<br>Class Name: MPS594<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down, one of the best professors in the school of public service.  Great sense of humor.  It is obvious that he is passionate about what he teachers and cares about his students.  It also helps that he is not too hard of a grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: MPS521<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2012<br>Class Name: MPS594<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class structure with a group oriented approach.</div></div></div></body></html>
