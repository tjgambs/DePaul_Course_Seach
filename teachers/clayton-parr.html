The choral literature that Dr. Parr chooses is of such a wide variety that absolutely anyone will be able to sing songs that they love.  He is always cracking jokes and if you sing your heart out and have fun, you'll be rewarded.  Absolutely take this class if you are a dedicated singer!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2011<br>Class Name: MEN123<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Knows his stuff :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2011<br>Class Name: MEN123<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Coolest guy ever. End of story this class takes dedication but it is the most fun and rewarding thing you can do for a grade. I love Dr. Parr and I think he is brilliant and if you don't like a choir teacher that knows what he wants, don't take the class. &quot;I am not asking for much. I am asking for perfections and I am asking for it right now&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2010<br>Class Name: MEN123<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dude before me just say &quot;kindygarden&#63;!&quot;  Great class.  Attendance is MANDATORY with a capital MANDATORY.  You cannot miss class.  The &quot;kindygarden&quot; kid is right, ****ing on the floor is much less of a hassle.  Great class.  Will take again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2007<br>Class Name: MEN123<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Parr knows his stuff.  He has an ear for music and will gladly help any students who ask for it.  He doesn't like slackers.  All that counts is effort.  If you try you will be rewarded with a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2007<br>Class Name: MEN123<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Parr is amazing!  He is a fantastic A Cappella director, and he gets the most out of every song.  The kid before that gave him a 3 1 1 can suck a fat one..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: CHOIR<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Parr's an absolute maniac...and as such, he manages to keep a really annoying class at least semi-interesting. Not by any means the best choral director I've ever had, but he's not bad. Pretty much all you have to do to get an 'A' is show up for class on time and pay attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2005<br>Class Name: CHOIR<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class will go down in history for being the one class all must plan their weddings, births, funerals and potty breaks around.  I would rather ****on the floor than leave class and hear a lecture from Parr about it later.  What are we in kindygarden&#63;</div></div></div></body></html>
