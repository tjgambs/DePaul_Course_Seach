But you have to be open to the material, if you're not you won't do well. This class made me think of things I've never thought of before and opened my eyes to identity. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2015<br>Class Name: COMM3030<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Professor  Esquibel was a professor who made this a very engaging class. She provides specific criteria to pass the class, and if you follow the criteria, you pass. She is very friendly, and open to provide help in your papers and presentations. She allows for the class to engage in a safe environment on a pretty serious topic. Excellent professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2015<br>Class Name: COMM3030<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>This class was really very interesting. Dr. E taught us how to be more understanding and compassionate towards other people. She showed us some of the everyday struggles that some people have to deal with on a daily basis, and how unfair life can sometimes be. Defiantly would recommend her class.  Go with an open mind, you won't be disappointed. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2015<br>Class Name: 3030<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>I liked this class. We got to know everyone. Dr. E is really nice and knows her stuff. She has great style and even brought up cupcakes:) </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: COMM3030<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Esquibel is by far the worst professor that I have ever had. The communications class I took was supposed to be about discussing diversity but she was disrespectful of students' beliefs and opinions if they were anything different than hers. Her assignments are unclear, she take weeks to grade assignments and she doesn't provide feedback. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2013<br>Class Name: INTC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool professor, great experience, and the assignments are not hard. Take the class, you'll enjoy it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2013<br>Class Name: INTC308401<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is outstanding. The professor allows students to set guidelines at beginning of class. She makes it clear that there will be sensitive topics discussed throughout the term. This made it easy for students to have open and respectful communication. Much of the work is discussion based and objective writing. Really, it's an AMAZING class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2013<br>Class Name: INTC308401<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Esquibel is an amazing instructor. The material and class discussion were relevant for our present day and age. The course load moderate. She allows you to express yourself in class and in writing without the fear of being judged. The course objectives are clear and as long as you show up having read the assigned materials you'll do fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2013<br>Class Name: CMN103INTC335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Esquibel is definitely my favorite professor at DePaul. I took as many classes  as I could with her. Her lectures were never boring. She always led great discussions during class. As long as you do the readings, the class will be easy for you to succeed. Her assignments can be challenging but she is always open to assist.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2013<br>Class Name: INTC335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. E's seminar was thought provoking and extremely relevant to many concepts outside of the classroom. Dr. E made the classroom setting a safe space for all different viewpoints, forcing students to think critically about other sides of issues dealing with sensitive topics. Dr. E was easily accessible and willing to help when approached.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: INTC335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Esquibel is the best professor I have ever encountered at DePaul. She makes class interesting by allowing her students to express their thoughts.Dr. Esquibel's rubrics are clear and if you have any questions she is more than happy to stay after class and answer questions. This is the second class I have taken with her. You will not regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Esquibel makes her classes enjoyable and makes it easy to get to know your fellow classmates. This class is easy when you read the assigned readings (which is not alot). Her instructions are clear and if you have any questions or concerns she is glad to help. She is fun, friendly, and approachable.  Take her class! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: INTC220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. E. is a great professor.  The public speaking class I have taken was very concise and organized.  Her use of class activities and group participation allowed everyone to gain the skill and ability to feel comfortable to speak in front of an audience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super chill class. Dr. E is cool. Pretty easy if you follow directions. I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2013<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>First of all, we played 'getting to know you' games at the beginning of the first 3 classes. What a waste of time. As others stated, Dr. Esquibel plays favorites and does not clearly state her expectations. She also simply reads PowerPoints for lectures and eventually ranted at us for not participating, wasting more time. I would not recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: INTC220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is a great class, but do NOT take it with this teacher. She refuses to spell out the details/expectations of the class until midterms when everybody is starting to fall short of an A. She penalizes great speakers becuase they don't list out every step of the speech process.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2013<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't enjoy this class. Her expectations are unclear. She can be inconsiderate to student's needs and comes off as egocentric.. I would NOT take her again for any course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2012<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! She grades TOTALLY arbitrarily and picks favorites. She doesn't explain herself or her assignments whatsoever. Terrible teacher. Terrible class. We spent 30 minutes once talking about how a guy harassed her on the train. That cost me, what? Like $100? Her class is a joke.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2012<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this class if you want an easy A from a communication class. Dr. Esquibel makes you work and I learned a lot in her class. It's not that she's unclear but the assignments are challenging because it's actually really hard to study culture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2012<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very flighty and inattentive to her students needs and wants. You ask her to clarify and usually she just makes it more confusing. I would not take her if i had the choice again.</div></div></div></body></html>
