He does not teach, he lets the class do the lecturing for him. He literally spends like 20 mins giving a lecture and chills for the rest of the class. He will fail you if you are 1% away from a passing grade. I don't even know how he even teaches at DePaul.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: DC277<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>This was a great class and I very much enjoyed the films we studied along with the professor himself. He's pleasant and funny during lectures, but he expects a lot of participation. Midterm was tough, no final exam but a research paper. I came to class every day and participated, did well on the exam and papers and I still didn't get an A. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2014<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pal is awesome! Super laid-back and makes the class very interesting. Homework consists of watching movies and answering a few easy questions. No tests. Final is a project that you work on through out the quarter. Don't buy the textbook, you seriously never use it. I would take his class all over again. Definitely my favorite professor thus far.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2014<br>Class Name: DC270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher! The Syllabi clearly states how the semester will go. This class was the Films of Richard Linklater. Prior to this class I didn't care about this director, But Professor Pal definitely redirected me to have interest beyond the scope of my Major. I recommend Professor Pal for Film Majors and Non Film Majors Alike. (TAKE THIS PROFESSOR)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2013<br>Class Name: DC110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unimpressed with this teacher.  Reads lectures directly off power points and shows little interest in engaging the class. The small assignments are easy, however, the large projects are poorly explained and graded harshly.  Don't recommend this teacher if you wish to gain any valuable knowledge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2013<br>Class Name: DC202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Daniel Pal is the coolest, most chill educator at DePaul. There are three 2-3 pager, big assignment concluding the course (you chose from list given), EASY midterm and Final. I seriously wanted to become a CDM major aafter taking his course. Great guy but an even better pfofessor. Take him you wont regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2013<br>Class Name: DC202501<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such an awesome teacher, I highly recommend him.  He is really funny, his midterms/finals are super easy too, one of the best Digital Cinema teachers I ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2012<br>Class Name: DC393<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took Film Festivals 2 credit class with him. It was very entertaining and I learned a lot about them. Not a film student, but it was still informative. Final project was to create a strategy for submitting to festivals which was fun to do, and some of the homework was to go to a festival. He's extremely nice and pretty funny, good guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2011<br>Class Name: DC202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Coolest professor ever! Make sure you participate and you'll be in great shape :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Introduction to screen writing with him. It was really really easy, which was nice. All the assignments lead into each other and you end up writing a 20 page screen play, but its actually pretty easy to do. Nice guy, not the most charismatic though. Class was often boring, but it was good to learn about screen writing I suppose.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2011<br>Class Name: DC227<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pal is awesome. You will watch a a handful of really good movies. The first half of class is based on topics and discussion and the second half you watch the movie for that week. He has weekly assignments for questions relating to the topics. They aren't hard. Strict on attendance. One midterm test.  One 10 pg final paper. Highly Recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2010<br>Class Name: DC227<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Film Philosophy was a really easy philosophy class. He picks good movies to watch and only lectures for 20-30 min. If you put some effort into the assignments and show up to class you are guaranteed to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: DC202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG --- I don't care what he is teaching, TAKE HIM!! Even if you don't like the topic, you will after taking this guy's class. Very understanding, material is crystal clear... let's you explore your creative side. AWESOME! (psst and very easy if you try)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2009<br>Class Name: DC270<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice guy who really cares about the subject.  I took his class on the Coen brothers and I really liked it.  Attendance is important because of the film screenings each week, overall it's a fun class and I would definitely recommend Professor Pal.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2009<br>Class Name: DC110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was more or less teaching what he read in the book, not really offering any new ideas to the discourse.  If you take a class he teaches and your not majoring in that subject, you'll like him, he is easy going and fun.  If you are in the class to further your education on the subject (film) you will find it a waste of your time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2009<br>Class Name: NM444<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>New Media class was great. He's an easy teacher, doesnt require too much or anything too hard. I was in a graduate level course and he didnt thoroughly grade our papers so its not anything to stress about. He's seems to be a really easy going too guy. Doesnt hurt that he looks like a hippie from the 70s though lol.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: BIGPIC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy, but this class was awful. It was easy in a tedious way.  He catered to students from other programs and had slides explaining the most obvious concepts.  His knowledge doesn't seem deeper than the textbooks or a quick Google search.  Come on DC, let's have some real upper-level courses instead of remedial wastes of money.</div></div></div></body></html>
