She's hilarious and has the best accent and she makes sure that you understand what you're talking about, you never feel left behind. Love this woman!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2013<br>Class Name: SPN207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Clara is short/spunky/a ball of fun. She'll definitely make you laugh. This was a conversation class, so she let us discuss the topics we wanted to/encouraged everyone to participate. Directions for homework were clear, although all the projects were done in groups and it seemed unreasonable to have so many in one quarter. I'd take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2012<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Clara is really nice! However, classes were pretty boring- not hard, just not very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2012<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super helpful (she tells you if you made a mistake before you turn in the test)and funny. Participate and she will love you. Her English is okay, but you can still understand her. I hate Spanish classes at DePaul, but I   really miss her as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2012<br>Class Name: SPN246<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really great teacher, I missed some classes but she was very helpful in getting me caught up in class. He is very sweet and she will do whatever she can to help you out with questions you may have. Her assignments are fairly easy and you typically work in groups... Oh and if you're a fan of soccer she may let you guys watch Barcelona.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2012<br>Class Name: SPN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Clara!  She's so nice and very understanding.  She did everything possible to make sure we have a fair chance at getting the best grade possible.  For example, she looked over our tests before turning it in and told us if we had any mistakes so we could correct it.  Easy if you study</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2012<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is super sweet and funny. Her English is a little shaky, so sometimes when she tries to explain something in English it's a train wreck, but she makes everything a learning experience. Grading is super easy. Just participate, she'll love you then. She speaks a tad much English in a Spanish class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: SPN352<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I suppose she teacher well, but then again I wouldn't know because I'm not a naive speaker. So when I ask her questions about assignments in English she always tells me in Spanish. This does not help me, some people may like this method. In class she rambles off so fast that you don't grasp much of what she says. Another teach yourself Spanish @DPU</div></div></div></body></html>
