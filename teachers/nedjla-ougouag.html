She's very nice and all, but she consistently contradicts herself. Half of the activities and homework (which are most of your grade) doesn't make sense because of her contradicting and unhelpful nature. She means well, but cookies aren't enough. Spare yourself the aggravation. Go with another teacher if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2008<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had a horrid time in her class.  There is no doubt that she knows the subject matter very well but she didn't seem patient with students who were having a hard time understanding the lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2007<br>Class Name: MATH098<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an excellent professor!! Very clear and helpful. If you pay attention and attend class you'll get an A. One of the best math teachers Ive ever had!!! TAKE HER!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2007<br>Class Name: CALCSECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has real world experience in Nuclear physics and other sciences.  Also a Doctor but practical.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2007<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took Dr. Ougouag for Data Analysis, which is basically a statistics class. She was very engaging, gave clear examples and lecture notes, used the DLWeb (which is similar to Blackboard) effectively, and brought in example applications of statistics from her experience as a NUCLEAR engineer! Smart and sharp professor, I highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2007<br>Class Name: STATS223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting lectures with great instruction.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2007<br>Class Name: STATSN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really likes teaching, and it shows.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really nice and will help you with anything if you ask.  My advice is to ask!  Her lectures, though well organized, arent always that clear and she likes to rush through things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2006<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She isn't that bad. She is an easy grader and later gives you the answers to the problems so you can see what you did wrong. Does have an accent but it isn't bad. Over all the class was great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2004<br>Class Name: ECT270<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is clinical, but good and is an easy grader.  She can be more clear on concepts but its not a hard class.  Class is boring if you dont want to learn HTML, most depaul students just use frontpage and think they know everything about the web.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2004<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probaly the most boring I've had at Depaul. If understand computers and there languages take this class, if you don't, don't take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2004<br>Class Name: ECT270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Organized lectures.  Helpfu at office hours.

Droning. Unclear. Confused. Difficult. And good luck trying to talk to her out of class. She is the invisible woman. If you want to learn something, skip this one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2004<br>Class Name: ECT270<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2004<br>Class Name: CSC223<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a bad professor.  Her homework is pretty straight forward.  Lectures are a bit boring, but it's stats, what can you do.  I'd take it with her, make sure you do the homework well...counts for 65% of the grade.  I hope the final is as easy as the homewo</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2004<br>Class Name: ECT270<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok teacher, easy if you do all the homework. But good luck getting help. She usually answers the wrong thing when you ask a question.</div></div></div></body></html>
