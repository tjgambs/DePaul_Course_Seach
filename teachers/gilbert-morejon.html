Probably one of the smartest professors, as he takes complex philosophical ideas and simplifies them for everybody to understand.  doesn't take attendance, just show up for quizzes which he notifies you what will be on it.  papers are long, but he is easy to get help from. highly recommended. and very funny</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2015<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is awesome!! He explains the premise of our readings instead of leaving one in the blank.
