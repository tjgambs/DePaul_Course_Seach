I'm so happy that I didn't drop. He is an amazing professor that you LEARN from. His teaching methods are GREAT. I got a A+. It was a lot of work but its college. He does not hand you the grade, he expects you to THINK on your own and figure it out.

Prof has big ego and believed most would fail/drop. In his defense, many lacked algebra and calc skills. FYI, expecting a good grade and a re-fresher during a summer session is ridiculous. Lectures delivered straight from book, has accent, no quizes, secretly takes attendence, gives partial credit. Got A. Said he was leaving DePaul...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him for summer session one. He started the first day of class telling all of the students that 70% would fail the class and after the midterm 70% had withdrawn from the class. He does not teach the problems he should be in class. He makes the class think the tests will be over the problems we go over in class but the test end up  much harder</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU WANT TO PASS THIS CLASS. HE EMPHASIZED 70% OF THE CLASS WOULD FAIL THIS SUMMER COURSE, AND CERTAINLY AFTER THE MIDTERM, 70% FAILED AND DROPPED. HE TEACHES YOU THE EASY PROBLEMS IN CLASS, AND PLACES EXTREMELY HARDER QUESTIONS ON THE EXAM. GOOD LUCK IF YOU WANT AN EASY PROFESSOR.

On the first day of class, he emphasized the difficulty of MATH 140, and said most of us would either drop the class or fail it, and said he had no problem with failing all of us.  Assigns TONS of homework.  I missed a few questions on the first quiz and got an 'F'.

He is very up-front about how he teaches. He means exactly what he says: it is a hard class and he is an excellent teacher.

He is a terrible professor.  Half of the class dropped by the midterm, which is not normal and just shows how bad he is.  I went for help once and he treated me like an idiot and wasting his time.

Quizzes every week which are fill in the blank always, including the midterm.

He takes you to the college level! So what if he is full of himself, we r there to learn. If ur stuck GO SEE HIM IN HIS OFFICE. He is much kinder and goes slower. DO THE HOMEWORK!!!!! The hmwk is only worth 5% of ur grade but ALL the quizes are based off it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2007<br>Class Name: MATH101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is tough and strict but he will improve ur math skills if u are a hard worker and naturally good at math. those who are not good at math or lazy stay away. i took the 101 class that used the online computers and it was a big challenage. he will NEVER curve a test or grades. the only mercy he will show u is by telling u to drop out. abandon hope.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2007<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher is extremely hard to understand.  He has a thick russian accent and my burst into fits of laughter.  He says he is a good teacher, this is true.

His accent is a little thick, nut he explains things well.  Homework doesn't count much toward your grade but if you don't do it you'll be lost on the quizzzes. If you do the homework, the day it is due he will answer any questions and do any problems you don't understand and answer any questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2007<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher, but a horrible human being.

He is definitly not easy but he explains things really well and is in his office if you need extra help.  He kind of seems like a hardass but is actually really understanding, if you just go in and talk to him.  He is a little bit on the creepy side but overall a pretty good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2007<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does not help review the homework and flys through stuff.

He called half our class stupid because half the class failed the midterm.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2005<br>Class Name: PRECALC<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't like this class at all and did not like how the professor taught.  He was very unclear and not helpful at all.  He does not let you use calculators on the tests, but his homework assignments are simple.  I honestly couldn't wait until the quarter was over.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2005<br>Class Name: PRECALC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I believe he is a great professor, and a great person. He is very nice, very helpful! So what that he has an accent. Think about it....all of our ancestors came from a different country...At least he is smart</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2005<br>Class Name: PRECALC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although he can be hard to understand, this guy definately knows what he is talking about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2005<br>Class Name: BASICALGEBRA<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
