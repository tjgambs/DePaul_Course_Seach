    Online course, deadlines were before the dates in the syllabus, but of course your did not know this so you lost points in your grade for being late. Unfair, disorganized and lazy instructor, did not get back to you with answers to questions. Stay far away from this one, horrible class, horrible experience.

    Stay away from this professor.  I had her for an online course, and she was horrible.  She's extremely disorganized, doesn't respond to email in a timely manner if you have a question (if at all), and her expectations for course assignments were different wherever you looked.  She's also pretty rude

    A bad professor and a bad person.  This is the worst professor I have ever had.  She failed to live up to her own expectations of class and did not take responsibilty for her actions.  This class has caused me and my classmates a lot of greif.  Most students received bad grades.  Stay Away!

    First class I had ever taken were I learned more from my fellow classmates than from the teacher.  I feel like I should have been given back my money and I am planning to contest my grade as everyone who has ever taken her should do.  Do not take any of her classes!!

    worst teacher I have ever had in my entire college career.  I would advise people to not take any class ever taught by this professor.  She does not help students in any way succeed in this class.

    Unbelievably bad. She returns homework 1 month late, if she returns it at all. She's a biased grader, totally unclear on what she expects. She arrives late, is unprepared and talks endlessly about herself. She's consistently an obstacle to learning. Do NOT take this course. Do NOT take this prof.

    She is disorganized and uncommitted.  She does not respond to emails or phone calls and takes a ridiculous amount of time to return phone calls.

    It is horrible to learn how NOT to be a teacher by a college professor. She is unorganized, unclear, and lied to me (via email) on several occasions.
