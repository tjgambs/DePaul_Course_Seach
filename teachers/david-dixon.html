Participation is 20%, and hw goes into participation. I personally liked this, because it made hw a completion grade, and all you have to do is ask a few question and answer two hw problems on the board throughout the quarter. He's an awesome guy too, and explains concepts well. Quizzes and tests must be studied for. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2015<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I would highly recommend taking Professor Dixon. He is a great professor and he made Finance fun. It was a tough class, but Professor Dixon was always available to help.

I recommend doing all the homework and participating as much as possible. As long as you keep yourself up to date with the homework and study before the tests you'll be fine. Professor Dixon is a great professor and I would easily take him again. His lectures are interesting and he explains all materials.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2015<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dixon is a great professor and an awesome guy. He was great at relating what we were learning in class to what was going on in the world. Dixon is the man, he's good at teaching and a fair grader.

The quizzes are hard but there is no surprises or tricks. He lays everything out for you to be successful. You just need to put extra time outside of class to get a good grade. He is available via email and such for questions but it's easier to ask during class. It's a pleasure to show up to class.. and mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2015<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Dixon was an awesome teacher. Show up, pay attention, and do the homework and you will get an A. Great real life examples and explains the topics well. He's also a really cool guy and gives tons of partial credit. Definitely take him for FIN 310.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>I liked Professor Dixon, if you sit in the front, pay attention, and do your work you will get a good grade. Although I spent a lot of time with the tutor and learning concepts, the quizzes and tests weren't as bad as I thought. I would definitely take Dixon again if I had the chance. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Dixon is a pretty cool teacher. A lot of real world experience since he works for Wells Fargo. However, his teaching style is pretty tough. You are assigned homework to do on your own and then he teaches the material in the next class. The quizzes were fairly easy however the midterm and final were quite challenging. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>The previous poster is not accurate, you can't possibly know about midterm and final before taking them in September. The course is challenging but if you do the homework you will be fine on the quizzes which are open book and the tests you get a cheat sheet which makes it really easy. The course is EZ as it gets though didn't really receive an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You have to read each chapter of the book yourself and do the homework problems assigned before he even teaches them. Quizzes, midterm, and final are hard. They are nothing like the homework. He doesn't allow much time for the quizzes and tests. Expects you to teach yourself. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2014<br>Class Name: FINANCE310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dixon is a great professor. The best thing about him is that he applies real work examples to classes which makes it really interesting. He is also a great resource to have for any "real world" questions you might have. Go Dixon!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers at DePaul! He will go out of his way to help you understand the material. You have to learn to understand the material, and lectures help connect all of the information together for you. He brings in outside examples that help clarify the information, and the best way to learn is through application. Take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2014<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Dixon was a phenomenal teacher.  He was very thorough in explaining concepts and truly cared if the student succeeded.  On top of this he brought real life examples to the table making the content more enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2014<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dixon was a phenomenal professor, when explaining  concepts he was thorough and brought real life examples to the table.

Most of the class period he talks about stuff that is irrelevant to the subject. He will give you partial credit for just writing the formula down on an exam so that's nice. Usually responds to emails quickly. If you are looking for an easy A this is not the class for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2014<br>Class Name: 310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The book is your Bible and you are on your own. Gives partial credit. Tests are super hard and most of the class time is spent on discussing irrelevant topics. You will have to teach yourself with the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2013<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dixon is awesome! Take him if you can! Very clear and makes sure students understand material. Tells you exactly what to study so it's easy to make an A! 2 open book/note quizzes, midterm, final. Will give you partial credit for showing work or putting something down that makes sense. Homework and participation points too!</div></div></div></body></html>
