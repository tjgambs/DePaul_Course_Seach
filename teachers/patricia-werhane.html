I attended her lectures with great pleasure. She explained difficult things in a simple way. It is true that D2L is her weakness and may be confusing, but in the classroom she is very helpful. I recommend her classes also because she is an easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2014<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the most disorganized college professor I've ever had. Her due dates are all over the place, d2l will say one thing, and her syllabus will say another, and she will say another. There is a paper due ever 2 weeks, but SHE GIVES NO GUIDELINES as to how she wants it. weekly discussion board. Just avoid her if you possibly can. Worst professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2013<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is an easy religion credit, but the professor is confusing and has conflicting guidelines. Her assignments ask for your view and it's due on Friday, while dropbox/lecture says to do something else and it's due on Thursday. Her grading then seems random due to conflicting instructions. 3 page papers every 2 weeks and weekly discussion posts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2012<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great there is no textbook for this class, she gives you the framework to type her papers so you know exactly how to type it. She gives points for attendance & participation which is easy points & as long as you follow the framework for the papers she assigns her class it cake. She did not give our class a midterm which helps for other classes, the final is 5 case study stories & you pick 3 & type a 3-5 page paper for each & use the framework you have been using the whole trimester. Easy class!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her class online and it was a mess that is, mistakes on her syllabus and misinformation; just a mess. Maybe she's better in class but I doubt it. She's confusing, don't give full directions, and not very approachable. Her assignments are confusing like reading a map to nowhere. Got tons of papers from her class but don't feel I learned much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: MGT242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid at all costs! Warning! She literally tells you to research a company online and explain how it relates to a person we were discussing during the week. Absolutely no guidelines to the papers, and if you do not do everything that she wants you to, expect your grade to drop at least a whole letter grade. AVOID!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/12/2008<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you want to get good grade avoid her class. she is bad!!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher. The entire semester is a discussion about different case studies. Likes lots of details when writing papers so be very thorough and you should do well. I enjoyed the class although it can be a bit boring at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS SO BAD!!!!

She's understanding and will listen.  She grades fairly, but do not be late to her class, she has severe penalties on tardiness and not showing up.  Do the work, take the class seriously, and you won't have a problem with her or her course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2004<br>Class Name: ETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good teacher, interesting class when we talked about the cases.  easy grader, i thought she was good, i got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: BETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty easy going teacher so far.

Class is not fun, matter of fact it was the worse hour and a half of my day.  Very boring and never lets class out early. NEVER.  Once again shes not easy and try to avoid this prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Real bad teacher.  Try to avoid her at all times.  Teaches an ethics course, but openly acts unethically.  She should be condemned from teaching.  Teachers like Werhane hurt the quality of teachers at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2004<br>Class Name: BUSINESS<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's a good teacher, very into her class, but if you take good notes in class, you'll do good on midterm and final. a little boring sometimes but overall not bad.</div></div></div></body></html>
