    Quite honestly the most disorganized, unstructured, and most poorly taught course I have ever taken at DePaul in four years. She's unfamiliar with topic of biochem and is unable to elaborate on anything other than the notes she copies out of the book. Exams are not representative of material taught. Ineffective teacher, rude, and disrespectful.

    You could learn more biochemistry from a beaker of spit than you could from dr vogel. AVOID.

    Erica is a new teacher at DePaul and it's pretty apparent. Her office hours are helpful, but in class she's very unsure of the subject matter. I wouldn't recommend her for biochemistry.

    "You guys are the WORST class I've ever taught!" - Dr. Erica Vogel.  This outburst speaks volumes on the professional demeanor and general attitude of Dr. Vogel. She is exceptionally rude to students, consistently unprepared for lecture, and just plain mean. AVOID AVOID AVOID

    Dr. Vogel (yes, she has a PhD.) is a poor choice for a biochem. generally unclear, and unsure of key concepts in lecture, students must consult a textbook if they want to ensure accuracy in the information she very often misrepresents. Lecture is mostly occupied with students correcting her. MasteringChem homework is disjointed from lecture topics.
