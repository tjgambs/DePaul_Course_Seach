There is a lot of reading assigned.  I didn't do any of it and ended up with a B in the class.  She uses honors grading (95 is A, 91 is A-, 88 is B, etc).  She's a nice woman.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2009<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of powerpoint. No homework except for two papers and a take-home essay assignment.

There is one paper, 2 tests and one hw assignment, its all easy if you just read or go to class. I would recommend this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: HST202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The one good thing about her was that she effectively ended my career as a history major.  Every day was filled bell to bell with monotonous power points.  Discussion was limited and steered back to the power points.  The class was Latin American History, yet we spent 80 percent of the course on her home country Argentina.  DONT TAKE !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: HIST203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of power point...easy test...everyone should get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: HIST203<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the worst history classes I have taken.
