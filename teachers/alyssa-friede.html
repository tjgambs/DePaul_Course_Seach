She is young and really knows what she is talking about. You have to go to class because class activities are her means for attendance, but the class does go by really fast. Midterm comes from her notes exactly and the review session really helps! I would def reccommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Alyssa very clearly outlines the class. If you come to class, take good notes, and know the Learning Objectives, you will get an A. The class average on the midterm was 92%. In addition to the midterm and the final exams, there's a case study write-up and an essay on improving behavior. The class is helpful, enjoyable, and classes lasted 90 min.</div></div></div></body></html>
