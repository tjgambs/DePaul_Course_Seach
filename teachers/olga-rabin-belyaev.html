Made an already difficult subject more difficult to understand, and was inconsistent with her teaching methods. Went to every class, after class tutoring, asked questions and completed all extra credit, and was still given a 69.9% in the class, which I was then forced to retake.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2011<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was a great teacher. very fun and helpful. 3 exams weren't too hard based on lecture not really on book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2010<br>Class Name: PSY354<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm surprised by the amount of good comments here. Class was extremely disappointing. She brought politics into class when it was completely irrelevant. Material was easy, but she was very wishy-washy with her grading. One minute claims she wants straight definitions and then claims she wants it in our own words. Class is not worth the hassle.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2008<br>Class Name: PSY356<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Olya loves teaching and cares about her students, genuinely wants to see us succeed. She gets upset and personally offended when students do not do their work. She practically created the concentration, and is doing the best she can without much Community Psych textbooks on the market.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: PSY354<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty awesome, passionate, smart professor. Is very interesting and loves teaching Community Psych. Attendance not mandatory but recommended. Midterm, final, and community service or research paper. She loves teaching her material, which makes it interesting. Great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice very passionate, class was interesting and i actually liked the discussion of class members experiences especially on the topics we discussed. easy A but be careful on the papers, she grades tough</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i didnt like her style of teaching. we just discussed the chapter by telling personal stories relating to what was being discussed. it was a very easy class but not as interesting as i had hoped a class about psychology would be. i love psychology but was actually really bored in this class. take it if you want an easy A. the work is easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2007<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very kind, knows her subject, passionate, easy grader, EASY tests, if missed clss her lectures on powerpoints. She keeps you interested...I NEVER FELL ASLEEEP! Take her: You'll get an easy A, knowledge, and won't feel like you have wasted your time!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2007<br>Class Name: ISP220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have 300 level classes that are easier than this woman's class. She is easily upset when students dont read (moreso than other teachers) and expects students to be eternally greatful that she gives a re-test for something she graded the writing as meticulously as a NY Times editor. She should teach English if grammatical errors are her niche.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the type of professor you are interested in hearing more from. Our class was discussion based but in this class she sparked so much intrigue and attention from the class we often stayed late just to finish the discussion. Ask her about her life sometime to, she has an amazing story.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: PSYCH105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes an awesome teacher, she is all for the success of her students.. this may come off as being an &quot;easy&quot; teacher but really is an important quality. she had her powerpoints on bb which was helpful if i missed a class and she was always available to help!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2006<br>Class Name: HUMANSEXUALITY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this was her first year teaching and her inexperience showed a bit too much.  majority of class consisted of powerpoints that were straight from the book. she sometimes takes attendance but if it was not required, i would have easily gotten an A just by reading the chapters.  she gives alot of extra credits. easy class but the book teaches better.</div></div></div></body></html>
