Try to go to his office and ask him to clarify a concept you didn?t clearly understand - the only thing he would tell you is ?We?ve already done this in class.? Be prepared to take a lot of notes, yet don?t expect to learn what the concepts really mean. There?re two exams and a monstr</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2010<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Two exams and a case project. About half of the exams are examples given in class, open book/note so as long as you have clear notes should be fairly simple. Project was simple, but VERY time consuming. Extremely helpful, in clarifying anything you didnt understand during class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very casual professor and very friendly. The project could have been a little more clear but overall the class is not that bad. He is more than willing to help if you need it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Rybak is knowledgeable and an overall good teacher. You will have 2 tests and a case project at the end. No homework. He teaches relevant information to the real-world. The task is of moderate difficulty.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2007<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>be pepared to take a LOT of notes... nice guy but the notes are a pain.. someone should tell him that he can use power point now.. instead of his ancient projector</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2007<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awful instructor! class does not make any sense at all! tests are hard - you need to read the book and really memorize everything! do not take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>overrated</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2007<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>his project is very long and very unclear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2007<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the case that he assigns us to do is - wow! really vague and a lot of work. thanks professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2007<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>midterm - calculations easy. but very subjective questions that have not been covered in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2006<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was alright.  We were introduced to many financial ratios to evaluate companies and the good part was that the mid-term and final was open note and open book.  However, did I learn anything from the class&#63;&#63;&#63;......NOPE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2006<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its an update of fin  310 with a little more on EBITDA. Total waste of time we never learned how to pick a good co from a bad co.  Gives us ratios and other tools, but never explains them fully, the speed through quick analysis of financial statments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher. You need to attend every class to get his notes to pass the class. Many notes to take, no text book needed. Recommand to bring a laptop to his class. Plus he is an easy grader. 10% particitaing, 30% midterm, 30% final, 30% project. He curves!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2006<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows his stuff and explains it well! I would definitely recommend this professor. He's professional, is not out to get us, and is helpful. The open book exam is not too difficult but you do need to study some & know what you're doing or else you won't finish in time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2005<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was very interesting and he is very clear with his notes. He always let us out early from night class. Show up and take a lot of notes b/c tests are open book. Tests are not that easy...about 80% of students don't finish on time or are still in class when time is up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Even though it's open book open note for the exams, it's not difficult but it may take you a while to complete. Majority did not finish in the time frame that he wanted it to be done in. Also, as mentioned, show up to every class on time so that you have the notes for the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Open book/open note tests because its an open book world.  Tests on application not memorization which is great and more like &quot;the real world&quot;.  Relates well with students and you learn alot.  Great guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2005<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy who likes the subject as much as he likes to talk about sports.  Just show up to class, take notes and you should ACE this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2004<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great sense of humor.  Talks about sports and other things to lighten up what could potentially have been a boring class.  Don't buy the book, just take down everything in his lectures and you'll do great.  Also, he's a CPA and CFA, so is well qualified!</div></div></div></body></html>
