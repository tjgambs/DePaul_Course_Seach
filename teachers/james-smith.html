    Firstly, this class is easy, but only if you want it to be. There are assignments you have the ability to complete at your own will but it can pile up very easily. The final is the same. He is a well-mannered, funny professor who tends to stray off subject (in a good way), though that fun atmosphere is a bit deceptive when finals come along.

    Dr. Smith is awesome! He makes this class really fun and interesting. If you pay attention and go to class you will get a good grad.  Just make sure to go above and beyond what he asks for focus questions. Overall great teacher.

    Rev. Smith is amazing. He's hilarious and even though its religion u will NEVER be bored in class. He often gets totally off subject and makes class fun. Hes a tough grader and don't take BS from students. Doing 2-3 pages will get u a C at most. Doing 5-6 ensures an A. Remember that and attend class and u will have an A.

    Very nice guy, extremely funny and understanding. Often gets way of subject but it makes the class fun! U get the assignments for class at the 1st day of the semester and choose when to do them yourself. In order to get an A take the &quot;required&quot; number of pagers typed and double it. If you follow this rule it will be impossible NOT to get an A.

    He was a great/funny teacher. He definitely showed interest to the class and the students. But he was a hard grader. When he ask for 3-4 pages of work, he means 5-7. So remember that.

    Reverend Smith is awesome.  He's got a great sense of humor and cracks jokes all the time.  He's a tough grader, when he says he wants two pages, he really means 3-4. Remember that and you'll get an A.  Easy class.

    He is super nice and the books are very interesting and insightful. I'm not a bi reader at all but I enjoy readin for this class. Rev. Smith is super chill and makes his lectures interesting by relating them back to students. He's kindof a tough grader but participate and you'll be fine.

    Good teacher overall. I did so-so on the questions that are mandatory which make up almost half the grade, did really well on the final and other component we had to do in class and got an A. super easy, class is mandatory and can get kind of boring he goes over what he did the previous class at the beginning of class. Overall pretty good teachersj

    Going to class is mandatory to keep up with the information provided and discussed. As long as you do the reading (also extremely important, as the class was designed as a seminar - not lecture), attend class, participate in discussions, and complete the assignments, it will be an easy A.

    You are only allowed to miss one class, however he usually spends the first half of class going over the exact same material from the week before.  If you can put up with being bored, however, its an easy class to take.

    This teacher was pretty straight forward and the quarterly assignments were easy. I think you can choose 4 out of 10 weeks to do the assignments. However, what no one mentioned is about the absurd final that was cumulative and 38% of your grade. I received all A's till the final. Overall good teacher just do not underestimate his final and STUDY!!

    He is very straight forward and explains everything on the first day.   I admit I was nervous reading his syllabus because it looked like a book HOWEVER! assignments were really easy and barely took a lot of time. You pick the days you want to hand them in! Exam was pretty easy and if he likes you and your on the border he'll bump u up :)

    I must admit at first the class seems to be scary but overall it is a pretty good class. I didn't know squat about the Bible but he really made it clear. The final is not bad because all you need to do is memorize the terms which you use on the essay part of final (which he gives you ahead of time).

    Ehhh.. not so good. I thought his class was ridiculously boring and hard. He's one of those professors that doesn't seem to think you have other classes to worry about. I guess if religion really interests you, you will like him. I personally wasn't impressed by him or his class.

    EASY CLASS! HE GIVES YOU ALL HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS FOR WHOLE YEAR ON FIRST DAY OF CLASS SO YOU CAN GET IT ALL DONE WITHIN FIRST WEEK IF YOU REALLY WANTED. NO TESTS OR MIDTERM. FINAL IS NOT HORRIBLE IF YOU STUDY. LECTURES GET WAY OFF COURSE AND OFTEN TIMES DO NOT COVER WHAT NEEDS TO BE COVERED. DEF RECOMMEND THOUGH. CANNOT MISS MORE THAN 3 CLASSES.

    Dr. Smith is a really funny and nice guy but he really lets the class discussions get off track- which is a pet peeve of mine.  There is a decent work load but its not unmanagable.  You won't regret taking him.

    The only thing that makes this class difficult is DePaul itself. DePaul needs to make it mandatory for you to take some sort of New Testament class before you take this class or you'll feel overwhelmed. Rev Smith makes it fun and practical. His final is tough if you don't study. If you have no memorization skills whatsover, drop the class. No joke.

    The final exam was ridiculous. Lecture are off-topic, random,etc.Ideas that your ?required to know? for the final are quickly glossed over in class. He?ll compensate for this by giving a final study guide but that?s even more confusing and misleading. It wasn?t fill in the blank but rather detailed questions concerning ?lecture topics?.

    He is really cool.  You learn but you also go on tangents during discussion about really interesting stuff.  Movies alot actually.  But as far as course work- he outlines EVERYTHING right upfront.  If you wanted you could do all the homwork within the first few weeks and be done with it. Just don't wait for the last minute. It's a good class.

    Hes an amazingly laid back teacher. I enjoyed taking his class. It is really easy to get an A if you do the work. He does count attendence but the class isn't really boring. The final isn't as bad as people make it seem. All you have to do is pay attention in class and its really easy to memorize. Homework is easy and you only get 5. Take his class

    So, I think I should mention that I (I emphasize this) I got an A.                          Anybody who complains about this teacher doesn't care about class OR learning, but just want the A handed to them. The final was a bit challenging, but honestly, pay attention in class and take notes, and you'll be just fine. :-)

    His class consisted of 5 sets of focus questions and 2 field components (2 papers that are 2 pages long). You can turn them in whenever you want. However, his final was impossible. He went psycho!! tons of things to memorize. impossible to get an A.

    I really love Rev. Smith.  He is such an intelligent man and has great lectures.  I stopped going to CCD when I was 8, so all this new testament stuff was just so fascinating!  I really wish I could take him again, but I don't need any more religion classes!  Definitely take him, courseload is not bad.

    Great professor. I found that my low homework scores improved for the same amount of work when I starting participating more. Do the reading about every other class period because if you dont, you wont be able to participate. Lets you decide when you want to hand in homework, so you wont be swamped. Do it in your free time.

    Awesome teacher.  Just participate in his discussions and he'll be happy.  It's not hard at all.

    Good sense of humor, great for gen ed req. Basic teaching style, we didn't get as in-depth as I'd hoped, which isn't bad if you're looking for an easy grade. Goes off on rants, which keep you awake. Good deal of reading but you don't have to do all of it. Pretty easy A.

    I really enjoyed his lectures. He answered every question well. He knew A LOT about the subkect and was never stumped.  He really knows his material.  It's a fun class to take.  It's one of those classes that gets you interested and makes you want to learn.  The test is EXTREME. You def. have to work hard. It's worth it if you're interested tho, de

    Dr. Smith is an excellent teacher. Super intelligent, funny, and makes you want to come to class. Makes you responsible by letting you decide when to turn in homework. Builds time management skills in a student. DePaul should use Dr. Smith for the standard in professor hiring. Great!!

    Lectures were fairly interesting, nice guys, and he knows his stuff. He's sort of a picky grader.  I just didn't like him as a professor for some reason.  I would take the class again, just not with him.  This was new subject matter for me and I sometimes felt like the assignments were geared toward people who were already fimilar with the bible.

    I learned a lot in this course, but if I had it to do over I wouldn't take it again. Class lectures were okay, discussion was sparse though. people just dont participate a lot at depaul which makes class painful. the word bank part of the final study guide isnt as all inclusive as he makes it seem. sort of a picky grader. glad its over....

    both the classes were very similar to each ther but both were quite interesting. you are to write 6-8 sets of question throughout the quarter and write two 2 page papers. it was not very difficult. no midterm, but the final needs some studying.

    Dr. Smith is really interesting and knows his material. However his classes sometimes rely on participation and DePaul students aren't very enthuastic, so class was a let-down sometimes. Otherwise he is fair and clear with his expectations.

    Prof. Smith is extremely nice!  His lectures are very clear, and he reviews the material (which helps everyone keep up).  Also, while he does assign many papers, you (the student) are allowed to choose when you will turn them in.  This flexibility was very helpful.  He is a very nice person generally, and a fairly good lecturer.
