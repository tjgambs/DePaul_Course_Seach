    He's really nice and laid-back. All u need to do is participate and read to chime in during discusions. The group projects are easy and the class is fun.

    Very helpful, usually clear, if you feel he isn't he is definitely willing to help if you're willing to put in the effort as well.

    He is the best English teacher.  I learned so much in his class.  Just make sure you do the readings and all of your papers and you will get a good grade in his class.  I love him and I wish I had him for all of my classes
