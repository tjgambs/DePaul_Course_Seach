While I do not usually find philosophy appealing, having him as the professor was probably the only reason I went to class. He does lecture a lot, but he truly loves hearing the student's perspective and will answer any questions you have during the discussion. Also, his voice/accent is amazing. I would highly recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Boring.  Long lectures with irrelevant tangents.  Extremely boring and unclear.  Does not stick to the syllabus at all and assigns too much reading.  Would not take again. Stay away.  He also wants participation in the class, but it is hard to do because he drones on and on. You must also only agree with his perspective to do well.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2014<br>Class Name: EXISTENTIAL<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's got a great mind for Philosophy as well as teaching but is occasionally forgetful and loses his place in discussions. The text materials can be very dense, depending on what course you take, but he is very open to helping anyone who doesn't understand. Good teacher overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2014<br>Class Name: PHL204<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You learn his perspective, and his perspective only. Class discussions are very inclusive, but are more of an illusion of discussion and more just a means to a very specific end he has in mind. You read a bookpassage, you talk about it for way too long, you write a BS response that he makes up the prompt for last minute. Not my type of phil class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2014<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall interesting class, if you read the assigned texts carefully and take notes. Material is difficult to understand at first, but after I began to read more carefully and take notes, I enjoyed the class a lot more. His quizzes are very easy if you read.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy is really nice. But you must really love philosophy!!! class isn't difficult but it is very boring, long lectures where he talks for a long time and then tries to get the class to talk. An okay class..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I chose to review Gucsal as my first review on this site, that shows. I really liked Gucsal. He is an extremely bright professor who enables others to learn dramatically if they choose to. He makes great conversations for lecture and influences main ideas to a crystal clear point. Take him seriously, and you should be alright.

PROMISE. His quizzes are worth little pts. 4pts at the most maybe. Class is very boring unless you REALLY LOVE LOVE Philosophy. He speaks the entire time & asks the class questions. At times had us take a quiz b4 he covers the material in class.Readings=moderate hard but Long. Gives SG!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2013<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>It is very easy class and easy to get A. Just read the articles he posts on d2l and be active in class. There 2 papers based on those articles and 2 tricky quizzes which are only 5% of the grade. I got A with no extra effort but have learned a lot. The easiest class I have every taken at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2013<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's interested and knowledgable about his material, however does not know how to teach it.  Not respectful of students time/grades either</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2013<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was hands down the absolute worst teacher/professor I've ever had in my life. He refuses to upload any of his lectures online claiming "he spends 1-2 days preparing them and it's not fair for us to have them at our lesure". He also has the most complicated ways of explaining concepts that could be explained much easier. Horrible guy.</div></div></div></body></html>
