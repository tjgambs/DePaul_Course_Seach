    Dr. Stevens is just an incredibly kind man. His lectures were surprisingly not all that drab given the material (stats). He really demystified a lot of concepts and formulas in statistics. Lectures were always super clear and I walked away feeling like I had a good handle of stats for research. Oh, and he's super super easy too

    Generally just a nice guy. Never had a problem with this class. Tests are open note/open book and are curved. Very helpful.
