He's incredibly (and frustratingly) intelligent, with a sharp tongue and quick wit. Though his instructions can be vague and repetitive, he still manages to provide insight and criticism for each writer-- provided they go seek it. Utilise his help, work with him, not against.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2014<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this as a hybrid course and I am positive that was responsible for my extreme distaste for the course and professor. Prof. Stolar is a cool guy but this class was so frustrating. If he's offering a hybrid class, SAVE YOURSELF AND DON'T DO IT. If he's teaching a course specific to one genre, do it. A general writing class? Skip it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic prof! Also my adviser. He's critical but not insensitive in workshops. Very helpful to improving your writing. Funny and down-to-earth. Definitely recommend his classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2010<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is amazing!  From day one to the last class he'll make you enjoy class.  He's really funny but also stays on topic well.  He also really enjoys his job and is super passionate, do take any of his classes if you get a chance to!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really nice teacher. He cares about his students and tries his best to help students get a good grade. I would recommended taking his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2008<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Stolar for Short Story Cycle and all I can say is I'm extremely sad the class ended. His class made my entire day. The books he chose for the class were wonderful. We went in depth with them all. Short quizzes on the readings, 3 short response papers and a final creative portfolio. He helps you out all the way and is hilarious! I love him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2006<br>Class Name: WRITINGFICTION<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is honestly the most amazing professor in the world.  Not only is he incredibly intelligent (went to Harvard and Yale), he followed his heart and dropped out of med school before it was too late.  He lives and breathes fiction and his book, The Middle of the Night, is such an amazing read - I would recommend it to anybody and everybody.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG291<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took Stolar for intermediate fiction writing.  He's really laid back which really opens up the class for discussion.  He's super helpful when you approach him with questions individually.  I'd definately take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2006<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dude's pretty nice and approachable but at times i felt like he was lecturing a junior high school class. in class work is somewhat insulting. he's alright. i can see people liking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2005<br>Class Name: ENGLISH490<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This St. Louis transplant prof was cool. This particular class that I took with him was a class I believe he got stuck with. He has a very laid back style and his specialty is in fiction writing where I think he would be fabulous.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2005<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>'Tis no pity pepper.

Last week he started ranting about Harry Potter. Just not my kind of teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2005<br>Class Name: WRITING<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2005<br>Class Name: ENG101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Stolar ROCKS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2005<br>Class Name: ENG320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2005<br>Class Name: ENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This &quot;Short Story Cycle&quot; course was very helpful in the development of my overall writing incl. fiction writing. Stolar is relatively challenging, but at the same time, he is also very helpful, understanding and just plain &quot;cool.&quot; His expectations are not unreasonable, and he knows and enjoys what he is teaching which is always good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2005<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy rocks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class, alot of work but I am a better writer because of this!

He's a good guy with a sense of humor and treats everyone well.

If you want to write, take a class from him; he is not only a writing teacher but also a writer himself which makes it easier to identify with his students.  Extremely friendly, understanding and funny.</div></div></div></body></html>
