I just had him for my science and science fiction focal point and it was a blast. The incorporation of actual science is sometimes complex and a bit confusing but he explains everything well and makes discussion interesting. I recommend him, very easy, fun class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice, cool dude. Took his Science and Sci-Fi class (amazingly interesting) and couldn't even tell that this was the first time he was teaching it. I read and learned so much. Greg knows his stuff!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chavez an extraordinary teacher! He is helpful, nice, and loves his job. He is very approachable and conducts his class like a discussion. It is so easy to get comfortable in the class. He is also a great writer and gives a lot of good advice. I would definitely recommend him to anyone! I still talk to him and ask him for writing advice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2008<br>Class Name: WRC103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>CHAVEZ IS AN AWESOME PROFESSOR!! HE'S SUCH A GREAT PROFESSOR. VERY HELPFUL, AND VERY GOOD AT RESPONDING BACK TO E-MAILS. THE WORK IS NOT VERY HARD, AND THE PEER REVIEWS HONESTLY HELPED A LOT!! I HIGHLY SUGGEST HIM FOR WRITING RHETORIC I... HE'S A GREAT PROF.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher, helpful and knowlagable. I know he likes the Socratic sessions, but at times the class got too far off topic and we wasted time. The assignments were neither difficult nor easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unengaging. I learned little to nothing in his Comp & Rhet 1 class. He's a nice guy, but he needs to step it up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is awesome! If you don't take him... you guys are missing out for sure. By far the best English teacher I've had. I'll take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Greg is a great guy.  Papers are chellenging but straightforard.  Just keep a basic idea of what is going on in the reading, and you will breeez through the discussions.  No final but a paper.  Take this guy, makes you want to learn and retain information.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Greg is really nice and truly smart. Hes knows a lot about English and challanges the students to learn alot. The essays are all worthwhile and on subjects that interested me. I would suggest taking him. I got A's on everything but I did work hard. Ps. Hes cute but married ha.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very nice teacher and the class isn't that easy, but it isn't that hard. He makes you work for you grade, but the class is still enjoyable. Whenever you need help he is there to answer any of your questions. I recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy and excelent proff, my best yet at DePaul. Class is always fun and interesting. He is a  hard, but fair grader on papers (not too hard, but hard). Knows what he is talking about</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Insanely smart. His english class is really demanding as far as weight of materials and writing assignments. It's hard to get an A but definitely worth it. He's unlike other DePaul teachers who just give an A just because. You really have to earn your grade. But he's a fun professor and pulls out facts out of nowhere. He's just that nuts and SMART!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2004<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy going, fun to have as a teacher.
