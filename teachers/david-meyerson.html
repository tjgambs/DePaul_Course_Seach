He's always willing to help you outside of class so he's very good with emails. but again, he's kind of difficult to understand. His exams are alright if you study. They're absolutely horrid if you don't.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2011<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Meyerson is an awesome prof! He knows what he is taking about and can make it easy to understand.  Yes, his midterm and final are a little hard but you will learn a lot and its interesting stuff! plusss hes young and REAAALLY cute! ;)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

Tests/papers are challenging but extra credit is readily available. Do the EC and you'll be fine. good lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2010<br>Class Name: STAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He means well, but he literally does not know how to teach. Entire class was lost from day one. No handouts, no study guide. Also expects too much from his confusing lectures, tests are nothing like the homework or book. And as a plus, he is an unfair and tedious grader. So unless you like teaching yourself and dropping your gpa, don't take him.</div></div></div></body></html>
