Listen in class, do your homework, study, you'll be golden and get an A. Guaranteed. I would take him. Very easy class. I didn't listen at all and was on my phone and I got an A. It was like high school math all over again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This course was relatively easy considering it was the first math class I've taken in five years. Downside is your grade is almost entirely comprised of the mid term and the final. A huge upside to the class is you don't use my math lab which I hear is terrible. Overall very knowledgeable and nice professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A. Extremely boring class. HW is very easy because answers are in the book and he does it for you the next class. You tells you exactly what's on the midterm and final. Attendance is optional. He obviously knows a lot about math, but he doesn't not know how to teach the subject in a clear way. Don't take him if you are serious about math.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2013<br>Class Name: CALCAL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ash is an amazing calc prof. Midterm and final only-ten questions each. He raises your final grade by half a letter if you get an 80%+ average on the hw, and he lowers it if you get below 80%. Hw is short and he does most of the problems in class. He's really nice and clear. His in class reviews before the exams are really helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2012<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are a math major DO NOT take him! His class is not challenging. He glosses over the chapters, only teaching what he prefers and skips over at least half of the material. If you're continuing on to multi-variable calculus you will be incredibly far behind.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the most clear, fair, understandable math teacher I have ever had in my life. I went from a C- in previous calculus classes to a solid B in his because his tests and what he expects you to learn are the fair basics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2011<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Ash is a great professor. Attendance is not mandatory but I'd recommend going in order to learn the material. Your grade is based on the midterm and final, and the homework grades will bump you up or down. It's a pretty easy class and he goes over the homework every class. Definitely take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2011<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher!!! he makes everything crystal clear and in a fun/understandable/helpful way. I also love that he won't go on until everyone understands what he's saying, even if one person is a little confused. His jokes are kind of corny but it makes him even more adorable.midterm&final aren't bad at all. Highly recommend him to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great teacher and he's very helpful..he may be old but he help and has great ways of teaching....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2009<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've never rated a professor before but I just had to for Ash. He's a great teacher, 100% take him if you can. He genuinely wanted his students to learn and was very willing to help. He clearly enjoys teaching and has fun doing it. Attendance is not mandatory and he has an excellent homework policy. best math teacher at depaul, no doubt</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ash was very helpful during office hours and he was very easy to understand.

Calculus is tough and he is easier than most professors. His tests come directly from the homework so make sure you actually do them (and not just look up the answers in the back of the book)!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2008<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best math teacher at depaul.  His tests are difficult, but he curves them A LOT.  And he will exempt a question if a lot of students do not get it correct.  He tries VERY hard to be funny...which is cute...laugh along...it makes the class go by faster!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2008<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes an ok teacher.... The only problem is is that he gives you all the answers to the homework if you ask for them.  Its really hard to want to work hard when everything is handed to you.  He tries to be funny though,  If you have an option to take 152 or 162... take 162 bc 3 hours of calc a week is really not enough, the lab will help you a lot!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2008<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of students take Ash because he's easy, which is true. But he's also the best faculty in the math department. He explains concepts entirely and with clarity. He stays on topic and teaches from a 10,000 foot level, which is easy to understand. He's caring and understanding. He's even better in his office hours. Overall, he's a top notch facult</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2008<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had professor Ash for MAT 150-152. His teaching style is not entirely engaging although his incredible ego and belief in his own humor keeps the classes going. Grades are based on a mid-term and a final, both of which are curved heavily, also homework which he makes nearly impossible not to get completely correct.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very very helpful. He truly wants you to do well in his class, and does a review session before each exam. There is a midterm and a final exam with 10 questions...he reviews with you what will be on the exams. He is a very nice man! Take him if you want to get a good grade! Most of the points you get are from the homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2007<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's probably the most understanding teacher ever..and really wants everyone to do really well. I agree sometimes his jokes are lame but he atleast tries to make math fun and interesting which is more than i can say for most math teachers! he makes things easy for everyone..I HIGHLY recommend him! he's really nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2007<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Slightly annoying, makes useless jokes and comments.

He is soo easy i had him last yr and he's a lil goofy and could stray off topic but if u do the homework you're fine. The mid-term and final are a breeze. Just take notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2007<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's practically deaf, but he's a nice guy. He's more than willing to take homework questions in class (which is actually most of what you do in class anyway), and the tests weren't that hard. Some of his material was more unorganized than anything I've seen in the past which made it harder to study sometimes. But overall, he's not a bad choice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2007<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!

His exams are relatively simple and his curves literally gives you about +10% to your final grade. He goes over the homework and lets you make corrections to it before you have to hand it in. One of the easiest math classes I have ever taken.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2006<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i loved going to his class, but i gotta admit he doesnt really explain stuff too well. he tells you exactly what will be on the midterm and final and goes over all homework before you hand it in. but what i didnt like is he would work through a problem and only do half of it. or he would give us an example and complete it differently than he taught</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: MAT335336340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He sucks. He is very lazy when he does proofs in class, which screws you because he will ask about them on a test. He constantly is erasing the board because of his careless errors which is extremely frustrating for your notes. Also he does a poor job of introducing notation and definitions. Don't take him if you want to go graduate school in math.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2005<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class consists of a midterm, a final, and homework assinments that you get to go over before you turn in.
