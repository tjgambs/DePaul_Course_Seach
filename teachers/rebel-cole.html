You learn tons from the cases. He wastes too much time in class blabbering about how wonderful he is, talking down about other professors or just random stuff. Lastly, he has a big ego. Won't give you straight answers and unwilling to help outside of class.  Take someone else if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: 798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Best class I took in business school. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: FIN380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very tough class. Many dropped after just reading the syllabus on the first day.

I loved that all the cases were real--it was really helpful to see concepts we've learned applied to real companies. Learned a ton, but the cases were very difficult. You have to do a lot of guesswork--and you had BETTER get along with your team members.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2010<br>Class Name: FIN380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this professor if you want to learn something. Enthusiastic, cynical, great. Weekly cases challenging, 1 final case. Hard work pays off. Participation huge. Weekly posts are interesting and fun. Makes finance fun.  Understands students compete w/ other top schools for jobs. Wants to improve the reputation of DePaul graduates. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2010<br>Class Name: FIN380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The greatest professor I have ever had! You will learn a lot in his class and at the same time he will entertain you with his funny comments and stories. Take him, especially if you are finance major!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2009<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Cole is a very nice, considerate, and thoughtful instructor; however, this was the hardest class I've ever taken. Required 20 hrs/week of study. Final was hard as hell--Thank God for the curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Econ Forcating & Fin Valuation. Amazing class, great teacher. Not as challenging as his 555 and is an easier grader. Really good if you are interested in financial modeling. Learned a great deal but definitely had to put in the time. Case based with little direction; you have to work through it w/ your group. Highly recommend. Interesting and fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Will learn a ton, but will have to work for it. This is a very time consuming class, but you will be much better off in the real world for it. His class is terrible if you are not interested in a career in finance, but if you are thinking about one, this is a great litmus test. One of the better classes, I took away so much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the prior post - Dr. Cole is a great proffessor.  He is a little quirky in his comments but if you are one to take things personally, then maybe an MBA course isn't the right place for you.  The only thing I would recommend is read prior to class (twice if possible) and do ALL the homework. The financial discussions we had were great</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't let these recent negative comments re: Dr. Cole steer you away from taking him. To put things in perspective, prior to this past Qtr he maintained a &quot;hot&quot; rating. Dr. Cole is one of the finest FIN profs at DePaul - you learn a lot of relevant info in an effective/efficient manner. I've taken a couple of his classes, and would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good professor but, sometimes, he took a long time to answer questions. Sometimes he gave up on explaining misunderstood problems just because you didn't understand his explanation. I would still pick him for this class but would know to expect a lot less help than I expected stating the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof is extremely rude. He hides behind Blackboard and ridicules students on the discussion board. He was actually 20 minutes late to our final without an apology. Don't take him for your own sake. He's one of those tenured profs who stopped caring about his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please do not take this course.  It is not a good investment.  Honestly I learned little  and had a very hard time getting help from the professor.  Furthermore his homework the first week is not time consuming.  After the first week it will take a minimum of 10 hours to complete one assignment!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not wish this class/Dr. Cole on my worst enemy.  It is 10 weeks of stress and confusion.  The lecture, book and homework (aplia.com) use different terms causing each week to take upwards of 12 hours.  The concepts are difficult, but Dr. Cole makes them more confusing and impossible to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TO TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. The other reviews must be referring to a different person. When asked questions, his typical response is &quot;what do think I mean&#63;&quot; If i know i wouldn't be asking genius! he is condescending and no partial credit on midterm. you get the 1st Q wrong in a multipart Q, u r screwed. WORST teacher taken so far in the program.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great instructor! Makes finance interesting with focus on real-world applications.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class online, which I do not recommend.  His video lectures are just him reading Power Point slides.  Mid-term was given online, final was in person.  In person he seems pretty easy-going, but his comments to students on the discussion board came across as a smug know-it-all.  If you take his class, do it in person.  Grades on a curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not what I expected of an introductory finance class. Dr. Cole ties a very dry subject to what's happening in the real world. He also does a good job of explaining how to crunch the numbers. Exams are tough but he gives a lot of partial credit and grades on a curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2007<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This has been my best prof to date.  He is enthusiastic, realistic, and generally a nice guy.  He starts the class off with discussion of current events every class.  This really brings real world into the class.  Topics can be difficult but he is very helpful and explains things very well.  Alot of material is covered so keep up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2006<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He had a proxy for the final and put material on the test that our class DID NOT cover.  Tests are hard, read the book and take close notes for the multiple choice.  Do the homework 2-3 times to prep for the cummulative final.  Avoid if possible.  Puts current events on the tests as well so read WSJ.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Who would think FIN would be interesting to an IT professional&#63;  He presents topics in a clear and concise manner -- taking into account that participants aren't all number crunchers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/04/2005<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class.

If you've done your homework exams aren't too bad.  Problems are exactly like homework. Exams also include multiple choice so you need to really know the concepts and not just how to crunch the #s.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2003<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests are semi-hard, but the curve is usually big.
