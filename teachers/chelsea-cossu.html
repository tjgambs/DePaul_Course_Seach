    I am not a photography major, I'm accounting &amp; finance. I was very worried about taking this class but Chelsea was very nice and helpful. She answers any questions you have and is willing to go the extra mile to make sure you understand. I don't know why anyone would give her a bad grade here. The only problem is the class is mildly time consuming.

    I  did not use the book a lot, but I can see where it could be useful for others if they wanted an additional resource for information because the professor does expect you to meet her expectations without her telling you how to do things. She expects students to go to outside sources to find techniques to "wow" her, which I think is a great.

    Taught class as if we were all majors and understood most of the vocab she used but if we didn't understand she would explain. Due dates are clear but is pretty lenient with late work.  She's very friendly and helpful

    Condescending tone, over the top peppy, lectures like she is talking to a toddler. Always smiling, even when she gets witty and disrespectful, because you asked a question. VERY UNCLEAR. The classes feel unstructured and 4 hours long. She talks from start to end and it ruined many of my mornings. Acts like the course is for photo majors.

    I'm not a photo major by any means, but this class was a requirement. The professor is fantastic - helpful, enthusiastic about the subject, and clear about the things she wants.

    This class is such a waist of money. She doesn't teach anything that is helpful. She grades assignments months after the due date and is unclear about them. She is annoying and rude. In addition if you don't have a mac or photoshop on your computer you will spend most of your time in the library for her assignments. Avoid her!

    This was the class that I was most excited about, but the one that I ended up hating the most. Cossu is peppy to the point of being condescending. Very unclear about deadlines and assignment details. Never has a helpful answer to students' questions. Bought two textbooks but never used them. Would not recommend DC 125

    I really enjoyed this class because I know photoshop and camera basics. I learned a couple new things, but mostly was for fun. Don't take it if you have no idea how to use a camera because the course material is too general to help. She answers basic questions well... Unclear on due dates, syllabus was not really followed.

    She is the most condescending and rude teacher I've ever had at any level. There's no such thing as a good question with her, no matter what you ask, she'll send you away with a snarky and condescending answer. Avoid her at all costs. Unclear on assignment details and due dates and expects everyone to be a professional photographer.

    I was somewhat interested in the class going in and by then I didnt want to use a camera again. She treats you as if youre a pro even though its a non major class. Too peppy to the point of annoyance. Very unclear about assignments and due dates. Do not take her.

    I absolutely loved her photo class. If you listen in class and go out and shoot photos, you will ace the class. Don't buy the book! You don't really use it. Anything you would need to look up is online, anyway. Take this class with her! She's very well-spoken and an excellent teacher. She has a strong personality so some people didn't like her.

    Really regret taking this class. She's way too peppy to the point of it being annoying. Completely unclear on her instructions, but then will grade so hard. For a non-major class, she's extremely picky.

    Horrible teacher. Condescending, does not teach well. Takes forever to grade. Is hot though but she made me hate photography with a passion. Also, takes forever to grade projects. Told us to buy the book but being the smart student I am did not and have not needed it once.

    Professor Cossu (formerly Goodwin) is the worst professor I have ever had at DePaul. Any excitement I had about the class was removed by her unresponsiveness, her condescending tone during lectures (news flash: all college students are not teenagers)and just the overall impression that she could care less. As a student, I deserved better than her.
