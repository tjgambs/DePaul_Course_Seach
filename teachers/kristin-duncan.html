You just need to make sure to be in all the classes.  You can not understand what she says because she speaks very quietly, and she is HORRIBLE at explaining things if it is not straight from her notes.  She does indeed go fast, which is why it is a good idea to be in all her classes.  Just bring somethin' to snack on *^_^*</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2005<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice, but she makes you feel as if you will never understand the material. I think the book is a better professor than she is. She flies through the material and does not explain it at all. She's hot as hell though!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>sit up in front if you really want to take this class because you cannot hear a word she is saying. does not answer &#63;'s when you ask her to. flexible with meeting. She is very nice and easy to confront, but her class pretty much sucked.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2005<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would highly recommend this professor for calc.

Doesn't answer questions well. Incredibly slow & boring lectures. The material wasn't too bad but she sure didn't make it any easier...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: MAT348<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very smart, but I suggest that you do NOT take her as a teacher. You will feel like you are in kindergarten. The class is actually still easy, but she does not answer questions brought up in class very well. The only reason that I stayed in her class was because she was the only teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Duncan is a good teacher. She is very organized and professional. She gives the Pratice Quiz and Midterm to study. The quizzes and the Midterm are similar. She takes time to help the students who has questions. I would strongly recommend that you take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enjoyed her class.

She's not to sure of herself. SHe'll grade you for homework, attendance and tests and quiz ! Nice teacher but can't explain that good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: MAT348<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's young and just recently started teaching so she doesn't seem so sure of herself.  The class itself isn't too bad but it's very boring and there is alot of homework that takes alot of time.  Not to be mean, because she sems nice but she reminds me of a kindergarten teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2005<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher, she talks to the board the whole time and you can barely hear her.  She grades homework for correct answers and not just for doing it.  She curves a little, but thats the only good thing about her teaching. Find someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: BASICALGEBRA<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Duncan was very organized and very helpful.  I think those that gave her a bad rating, did not take advantage of her office hours for additional assistance.  Math is a very difficult subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2004<br>Class Name: BASICALGEBRA<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never had such a great math prof! -If you put in the work (which is reasonable) you will do great in her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I couldn't even continue taking this course because she was such an awful teacher.  she was terribly boring, and i fell asleep after 5 minutes the few times at the beginning of the quarter that i did go to class.  i don't recommend anyone to take her and I think she makes depaul look really bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2004<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exteremly timid woman with no apparent teaching skills.  The notes are simply written up on the board -and that's the course summary.  When she does explain, her methods are more complicated than needed, only confusing the students further.  If the course wasn't easy, I would have done poorly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes is the stupidest teacher i have ever had a class with.  She writes stuff on the board and doesnt explain what shes doing.  She just writes off her notes and doesnt know what to say when she gets something out of nowhere without explaining to anyone. I leave early more than half the time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When you ask her a question she seems not to know how to answer it or explain it to you.  When she rights notes and examples on the board it seems as if she is just doing the problems by herself because she doesn't explain them.  Also many of the notes from the class were not useful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: MATH150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has no confidence in her teaching skills and it reflects in her lectures. She skips steps in problems all of the time.  She moves at a fast pace and doesn't answer questions well.  Tests and quizzes are relatively simple though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2004<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you take the time to see her after class she will help you understand the material. In class, she moves at a fast pace and talks very quiet. She assumes you know the material if you don't ask questions, so be sure to ask! 2 midterms, 1 final, 7 quizes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2004<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she talks very quietly and doesn't explain things because she thinks everbody already knows the stuff she's talking about</div></div></div></body></html>
