She expects professionalism out of her students, but is a fair grader for assignments.  Midterm was easy, and there is a final and some assignments.  Speechs are also a big part of the class, but not that difficult.  One group project, a pretty easy A so far!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2015<br>Class Name: BLW203<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She's nice but tends to be a bit snippy with the class. Her behavior is determined by whether or not she likes you. Attendance is mandatory and she doesn't provide any slides. Her tardiness policy (which she broke by being late daily) is also very strict. That being said, she curves tests pretty generously so if you show up and listen, you'll pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: BLW203<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this class</div></div></div></body></html>
