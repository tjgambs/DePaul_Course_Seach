Enjoyable class during lectures and labs.  Very helpful as well and wants everybody to succeed and give 100% effort. exams are challenging (no doubt about it), but the extra credit helps and ask questions along the way. Just show up, take notes, and listen. very beautiful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2015<br>Class Name: BIO260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very passionate about genetics on both an academic and personal level.

She's extremely intelligent (obviously) and experienced in her field. TAKE HER IF YOU CAN!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2012<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, long classes delivered by PowerPoint, but open to class participation and engagement. Very pretty.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a fantastic teacher! The information may seem to be hard or overwhelming at first, but she does everything possible to get you to understand it. Got out early almost every lab/lecture. The labs are all extremely helpful and interesting, plus she gives tips when it comes to writing the lab reports (there are 2). Take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2011<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Pamment was a great teacher, I have never received a higher grade in a science class in school. I recommend taking the class with the lab, she is very helpful and very easy to talk to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2011<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am not a science person. Dr. Pamment made this material interesting and manageable. She is a FANTASTIC teacher. She will go out of her way to help you and answer questions. Her lectures are crystal clear and sometimes even funny. The labs are well designed to help you understand the lectures and readings. Study hard and enjoy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2011<br>Class Name: BIO151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The quality of this visiting professor is good. Has patience but I thought the book was expencive. 100+ used. The course itself is definitely not an easy. Most of the learning will be on your own and parts during lectures. Good professor but not an easy class if your work ethic is mediocre. Not bad to look at either, DEFINED FACIAL BONE STRUCTURE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2011<br>Class Name: BIO151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Pamment is the best professor I've ever had. Her lectures are clear and she has a true desire for her students to learn. She offers her time to students needing help outside of class and allows time in class for discussion and questions. She is truly passionate about what she teaches and has a great sense of humor. Highly recommended!</div></div></div></body></html>
