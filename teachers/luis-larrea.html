The thing is it is highly, highly difficult. Maybe I just was put into a bad group but this required lots of effort (20 page paper + presentation) He is extremely knowledable and cares about his students, but is very difficult. I wouldn't recommend if you're looking  for an easy A. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: MKT557<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Luis's class! The lectures are a bit dry, but he truly loves and cares about what he teaches, and doesn't want you to struggle to understand the material. I would take his class again in a heartbeat.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2014<br>Class Name: MKT340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>One glorified book report. One awful group project (paper & powerpoint combo). One written test as the final. Participation is important. For the group project he takes public speaking seriously in the powerpoint part, but won't tell u. For the final he gives you a study guide. Do ask questions about requirements, he forgets to explain details. A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2014<br>Class Name: MKT358<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked this class.  I didn't think it was hard at all.  I never even bought the book.  He assigns articles to read every week, so I just read those.  Just show up and contribute once each class.  He also mentions in the syllabus to schedule a meeting with him.  DO IT!!! I got an A, those who didn't meet with him, didn't......</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: MKT360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most of the comments here are accurate. He is extremely experienced in the field and gives you invaluable adise in career and international marketing. Class could definitely be more dynamic, but he has very interesting stories. He is a hard grader, but nothing out of this world. Take him! always very willing to help. Great guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2014<br>Class Name: MKT340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy! His lecture is mostly him talking about cases in the book and discussing current world issue with the class. He shows movies sometimes. Mandatory attendance, 1 book review, 1 exam, 1 final group paper & presentation. Quite harsh grader. Participation counts! His voice is a little soft so sit in the front.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2012<br>Class Name: IBSINDI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Traveled to India with Luis for the summer with study abroad. He's awesome! Prior to departure, he may seem quiet, but he's very nice, very intelligent and only wants to drink coffee and read the daily paper. Great person to network with! He's  the coolest man on Earth!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2012<br>Class Name: ICS350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>professional, yet can relate to the students to make us get more out of our studies!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: MKT340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You'll definitely learn a lot from Larrea. Hardly uses ppts which is a good thing. He's been all over the world and really knows his stuff. Pretty funny too. Lots of reading but easy. 2 exams and 1 paper. I think our class got lucky though because he was so busy outside of class that he didn't make us do the group project.. id take him again though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2009<br>Class Name: MKT360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very cool professor, you learn an immense amount of info, class is tough and requires a lot of dedication. lots of readings and Harvard articles which are on the exams. the Exams are written and intensive so you need to bust your A** for an A. There is also a project which feels like real world because you can go in many ways with it. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: MKT340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very nice, knows his stuff and makes the class interesting. There is a lot to read from the textbook, cases and HBR articles.

Tests come mostly from the case studies, so keep up with your reading! Participate a lot because he'll bump your grade if it's on the edge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2007<br>Class Name: IB550<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite professors.
