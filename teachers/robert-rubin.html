Don't take it if you don't have a decent amount of time to commit outside of class. Partnering with a non-profit was by no means an easy, do-it-in-a-couple-weeks task.

AWESOME TEACHER! Only thing I would ever disagree with him on is that his take home quizzes are easier than in class quizzes. The classes quiz grade was high because most people would take the at home quiz in a group. I did not, I had a VERY VERY VERY hard time doing the quizzes because they are 40 mins long and you are open book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2013<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my first class in the MBA program and remains the class that I measure all others against.

I took his class during intersession, we had 3 mini online exams, 2 case studies & 5 in-class activities.

You should have the book but you can share one with someone else to save money. You mainly need it for taking exams.

Great teacher for OB. He lines out exactly what you need to know and ties every article or outside of class activity into his lectures.

Dr. Rubin is a very engaging lecturer. The material is great and probably a little different (Better) than similar sections of 500. For example: the management evaluation center he uses is a much better value than the other sections.  Take this section just for that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2011<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor!

Knows what he's talking about, realizes that evening class students also have jobs & personal lives and makes homework & study time appropriate.

He is not going to admit he makes grading mistakes but grades regular assignments easier to make up for grading irregularities.

He cares so much about his students and knows a lot about the subject.  Treats you like an adult, does not re-teach the material if you miss class.
