He only assigns homework every other week, and you only take a midterm, final, and final project. Most of the classes start with a short demonstration/PowerPoint and then in-class time to work in the computer lab with a partner. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2015<br>Class Name: 120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Morales is a good teacher but the subject for LSP 120 is pretty boring.
