Attendance is mandatory because there is group work involved during class time. Easy A class. Only downfall is that all these communication classes require you to take an online work personality test that costs $35. No way around that, plus purchasing business cards/thank you notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely amazing class that provides you with so many useful life and professional skills.

Prof. Protzman is very clear and precise. It is an easy class if you turn in your work, listen, take instruction, and constructive criticism. The things you learn in the class will go a long way. It was a great boost of confidence. The course content doesn't necessarily have to be read... But I strongly suggest it. *thumbs up*</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2013<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Zak is the greatest professor at DePaul!
