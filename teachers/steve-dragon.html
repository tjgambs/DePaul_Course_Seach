He will not hold your hand or coddle you though his courses. I would not recommend him to anyone not willing to ask questions or put work in though. I do recommend him to anyone that truly wants to learn the subject. The real benefit is you will walk out knowing the subject matter.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2013<br>Class Name: TDC460<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Steve is a great professor. Very clear on what he wants, organized and committed to everyone's success. There are few minuses like stiff stance on assignment deadline, errors in labs/hw assignments and participation is not something thats very clear. Overall, challenging, but usefull course with decent support.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2013<br>Class Name: TDC460<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was a very challenging course, but it is very helpful. The Professor is very cooperative and knowledgeable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: TDC460<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just took my midterm and it was harder than expected. I read the lecture notes 3 times and wrote down all of the info in BOLD as he said it was the important stuff and never used it on the exam. He will not except questions via email and is slow in responding to the collaboration site. Found out our lab was wrong after attempting it 3 or 4 times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2011<br>Class Name: TDC460<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are few experienced students in class who already understand the subject as much as he does; based on that, he thinks everyone is on the same level, and doesn't go deep into explaining how he arrives to solutions for given problems. He couldn't put himself on student's shoe.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2011<br>Class Name: TDC463<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORTHLESS!! Goes into depth in materials not on the exam. Makes mistakes while reading off slides from past professors. He even stated that his exams are &quot;challenging&quot; even for him a he writes his exams.Lectures are vague and fast. Doesn't care if you understand the material and goes by his schedule.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2011<br>Class Name: TDC463<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The WORST teacher! Makes multiple mistakes and he is just reading off the slides that past professors gave him. Goes into depth in materials not on the exams. Gives vague and quick lectures, expects you to already know the material. He stated that his exams are &quot;challenging&quot; even for him and have mistakes on it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2009<br>Class Name: TDC365<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely horrible professor. Classes are relentless, brain-melting power points. Homework is straight out of the box and pointless. Labs are so incomprehensible there's almost no point in trying. Also, his exams are so poorly written that you have to correct him on errors and explain some of the solutions to him! Avoid at all costs, total waste.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: TDC365<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He obviously knows a lot, he just isn't really good at teaching it.  Hard homeworks, harder labs, and even harder tests.</div></div></div></body></html>
