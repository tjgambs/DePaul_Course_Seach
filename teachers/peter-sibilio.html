We had to read a lot and pay attention in class. We had a quiz every two weeks multiple choice, a five page paper and a final essay exam.

He has a very inappropriate sense of humor.  The quizzes are moderately hard, but his lectures are incomprehensible due to his habit of getting side tracked and off topic.</div></div></div></body></html>
