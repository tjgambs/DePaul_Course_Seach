I got an A and I didn't even put much effort. If you are a half decent writer you will get a B for sure. If you miss class your grade will suffer, he takes attendance. After taking this class you might start to dislike the EPA and environmentalists.  The reading, meh, I barely read 25% of it. Easy class,the prof. is just dull. A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2013<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>God he's boring! Lots of reading but you don't really need to read them all unless it's ur turn to informally present your reading with your group. Each class is basically assigned groups present their part of the reading. Participation/attendance, 10 page research paper, 10 page take home final, and 3 article analysis/week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2012<br>Class Name: FIN440<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So here's the deal. I took Mathys for 2-3 classes over 20 years ago. He left such an impression on me, I googled to see where he was today & found his name on RYP. If you pay attention,it may not get you a job but it will help you MAKE & KEEP a boatload of money for yourself (not overnight but over the years).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2011<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST PROFESSOR EVER!!! He is a conspiracy theorist, and instead of talking about environmental issues, we discussed how every issue we are told is false.  He says global warming isn't a problem, and he even said that second hand smoke is less of a death risk than standing in a bar... He doesn't teach and just requires you to read.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2009<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned absolutely nothing from this class!!! He goes on tangents that don't make sense.  The midterm and final each count as 40% of your grade and his exams are HARD!!  Don't take this professor!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did not take him for finance, but for ICS 392. Lots of reading, but he is very knowledgeable. He uses facts from credible sources to challenge many of the half-truths people such as Al Gore feed the public. If you are interested in actually learning something take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor!

Dr. Mathys will go to any length to make sure you understand everything. Don't listen to people who say it's too much work because with Mathys there is no right or wrong answer, if you do the work you will get an A. Most interesting subject you will ever take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Mathys is the most incredible professor at Depaul University. He doesnt force you to do the work, and you don't have to read every thing he assigns, but I suggest you do because you will learn so much. Everything in this class is so interesting. He teaches you how the real world actually works. The best professor I've ever had!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2009<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will learn more in this class than in any other. Dr. Mathys is one of the most knowledable professors I've eve had.

I'm glad that I took this class, even though; there were too many writing assignments and lots of reading. I would recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2008<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is just 2 hard! Written Mid-term and final exams, both 15 pages long! Have to do 2 assignments 2 pages long, but in order to do them you have to read 30 news paper articles! The average in the class for the midterm was 63% and only 2 people got a B. Most people dropped. Gives a little curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2008<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A LOT OF READING, A LOT OF WRITING. 10 page research paper, 10 page final, 24 journal entries at 1 page each = 44 pages. Plus, you have to come to class and &quot;participate&quot; - Give me a break Mathys, no one ever reads any of the articles and all we do is sit and listen to you talk about social security, population, and how babies are killed in china.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2006<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First, this is a VERY TOUGH subject as it is. Second, this professor is NOT a thorough instructor. NO TESTS, 2 SMALL WRITING ASSIGN'TS, MIDTERM & FINAL, THATS IT. Not many chances to earn points. A MOUNTAIN of reading (Text + Articles). If youre not an A student, take someone else. He does curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2006<br>Class Name: ICS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes tough</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2006<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was really easy, although the papers were kind of a pain.  Overall though he's a really interesting professor, I learned a lot from this class with very minimal effort put into it.  I definetly recommend taking him for ICS, he seems easier then the other teachers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2006<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is extremely vague and unclear. The final was take-home but requires a ton of reading in addition to a 10-page research paper. Going to class is pointless...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2006<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2006<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brilliant man.  He may make you work hard but you learn the material.  One of the better teachers at DePaul.  The test was curved.  Not everybody failed - I know a number of students who got B or higher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2006<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the worst teacher I've ever had! I went to every class and really studied. I still got a D+ which made me retake the course. I took it with Klingenhagen, and got a B+. Stay away from him. He will drive you crazy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man does not have a structured class.  there are so many articles and handouts that you can't keep things straight. the whole class failed the midterm.  I learned nothing from him except how to fail a class.  he is a terrible prof.  you will not  understand what he expects of you.  DO NOT TAKE IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ANYTHING.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although I agreed with a lot of what he said, it was mostly political and most students getting introduced to money and finance will learn nothing. One of the two least effective teachers I have run into here at DePaul. Some of his views are screwed up too. Example: he said Augusto Pinochet (brutal dictator of Argentina) was fighting autocracy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: 220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i only showed up half the time and got an easy A. take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just awful.  It's not the world's most difficult class, but Mathys is terrible.  He makes going to class seem like sticking your head in an oven for 90 minutes (that might be better actually).  Doable, but really not worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2005<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor. Requires alot of studying but he tells you exactly what is on the test. I got a solid A and did nothing more than he told us to do. The sad people on this board are slackers.

He is an extreme right-winger who loves to preach about social security, population, and medicare.  His tests are all over the place from his thousands of readings.

I got an 83% on the Mid-term an A in the class BUT YOU NEED TO STUDY. DePaul students are really pathetic in this regard. He brings real world issues into the class.

However, he is extremely detailed with his midterm and final exam.  He won't ask you your overall knowledge of a subject he will ask you very specific questions so you better read the material backwards and forwards, especially the handouts he gives.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mathys is a great teacher. Knows his stuff and is very clear when it comes to the final. The only reason some people have problems is because they have to study. Do the readings and study only what he tells you on the test and you will do well. Got an A and would take him again any day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2005<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared to hear about birth rate and social security EVERY SINGLE CLASS.
