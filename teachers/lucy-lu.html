Very helpful and understanding. For this class you will need the book but can find it in the library.  Not an easy A but is not hard to get one. Just show up for class, participate a little and study for the tests and you should be fine. Great Prof and class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: CMN501<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is truly amazing!  I learned so much in her class and recommend her greatly!  She always has an open door and encourages you to explore ideas.  Grad school is work and if you want easy, well, you are wasting your time in Grad School.
