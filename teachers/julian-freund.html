Don't feel shy to voice your opinion, he's a chill teacher. No final exam, but three papers.You are free to write about numerous topics that interest you, provided they relate somewhat to the current reading being discusses. Easily the best literature teacher I ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall a pretty good teacher, he always has a good discussion going in class. He remembers all of our names which isn't necessarily important but it's the little things that count.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great teacher. His class was mainly lectures but it was very helpful. You can really engage in a class conversation and share your opinions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The course itself is boring but Freund makes it easy, clear and somewhat interesting. Great and helpful guy. Very effective teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an okay teacher, even though the class can get a little boring at times. The work was moderately hard, but not too bad... Just the ordinary writing class requirements. The final research paper is 10-12 pages, and he has a lot of guidelines which can feel a little strict, but they help a bit. No reason not to take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is good, but not amazing. Class is a little boring but he is a nice guy, and understanding. If he is an option, there is no reason not to take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really a great teacher and actually cares about the subject and how his students write. Reader Responses are easy boost to your grade (1p single spaced) & the 4 papers you write will help your grade as well as long as you do as asks by utilizing what he taught in class (audience, stance,etc). Great teacher & interesting/helpful class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class was one of the more interesting I took this quarter. RRE essays are about two pages long (one single-spaced) and three other essays are 10-20-30% each and about four pages double-spaced. Got a poor grade on only the last one, which I don't feel is fair (the 3rd paper is much different from the first two).Take him if you have good writing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a cool guy. Not once did I feel annoyed or angry at him at all when he presented his viewpoints nor was he condesending as someone said. He's a nice guy. His class is easy going. He does talk a bit slow but he's a great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got an A in this class so im not upset because of a bad grade... he is a HUGE liberal.. if you love obama take him because he talks about him constantly and we have to read about him. And if you dont agree with him he makes you feel like your opinion is wrong. Most of the time i left class annoyed. and be prepared to hear stories repeated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love english, and was in AP english my junior and senior year. I got A's in all my classes the quarter I had him except his. He isn't unmanagable or difficult, just difficult to talk to. He talked down to a lot of the students. He is very liberal, but scoffs at people. Sort of a jerk. Couldn't stand him. condescending. I suggest someone else</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He enjoys teaching his classes. The work is not too much, but it does take a little bit of work to get an A. Does a good job of clearly stating what he expects. I recommend taking his wrd 103 class, it sounds easier and like more fun than others i have heard about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was alright. All we do is talk in class... and at 8:30 AM that puts me to sleep. He's a very nice guy though, and if you need help he's very willing to give it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>decent guy!  not the easiest, and not the hardest.  enjoys what he does.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor and very lenient with assignments.  Very interested in current news and topics students are interested in.  Great discussion class and an enjoyable time spent.

It is all based on the articles he assigns, but they are pretty interesting.  Make sure you do all the work.  Sometimes it seems that he grades you down based on his opinions rather than the quality of your writing, so it can't hurt to write about what he wants to hear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2007<br>Class Name: ENGLI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's the man</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sort of a hard grader, does expect you to know what you are doing. Participate in class discussion and seriously be interested in your topic as he says or else writing a research paper about it sucks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher. Very lenient. Interesting readings and he asks for you opinion on them a lot. Not a boring class at all! I recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This **** ruined my life. He assigns vague topics then only wants you to write about what he wants you to. WHen I asked him what i wsa doing wrong, he ripped teh paper form my hands and went on a tyraid. he made me cry. i hate this ****bag.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher...makes you do a lot of reading but discusses it all in class. If you don't read you will be lost and he will know it but otherwise hes extremely nice and helpful. he was pretty lenient when it came to deadlines too...he always gave kids an extra day or 2 to turn in assignments. I reccommend this teacher 100%!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took his class last year and I found him very helpful.  He may be strict on deadlines, but if you take the time to actually come in and commit he is very helpful on what needs to be worked on.  Sometimes says random facts for fun in class. NOT AS HARD AS PEOPLE MAKE HIM OUT TO BE. Great teach...i took him twice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i loved mr. freund's class. he is truly a very kind and patient man andi learned so much. he is so easy going. a lot of people missed classes so many times, they should have failed, but he just adressed it in class one day (2 weeks before the semester ended) and said he was dissapointed, and moved on. hes so easy going and approachable. he answers </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His grades hard on papers, but he is an intersting teacher. Personally, I liked the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NOT helpful. NOT nice. STRICT on deadlines. he really sucks, and his class is soooo boring. the topics discussed in class are shallow, and does not give helpful input on papers. if you miss 6 classes even with valid excuses, you automatically fail. and tardies count as absences. DON'T TAKE HIM.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had a great experience in his class.  There is really not that much work that is required, just that the papers have effort put forth and there is a strong change from draft to finished product.  He will definitely make you a stronger writer, but you need to be open to criticism.  He is also a very nice and helpful man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's great to talk to.  His class was interesting, I learned a lot about world affairs.  He doesn't give much imput towards paper before the due date. however he does give ample time to peer edit in class...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2005<br>Class Name: 102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hoorible Prof.  Grading style is purely subjective to his underlying bias. Follows his own rules and insists &quot;the book is wrong.&quot;  Clearly an unpar professor as pertains to his subject matter and clarity.

Class wasn't too difficult - readings were quick and homework consisted of 4 papers (with drafts) and 8 one paged reponses to the stories. Use the St. Martin's Handbook. Half lecture half discussion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class bad teacher.  He is the kind of guy I would like to have a beer with and pick his mind but when it comes to papers he expects you to know how to improve on your own.  He treats everyone like they are just out of highschool with no life experience and is not very availible for questions</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: 103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the class was a standard highschool level class. read the material, speak in class, and argue a well defined point and you are guarenteed an A. really easy. never found anything to excessively praise of condemn about Freund - a neutral teacher. good but not great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ive learned a lot from this class about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very HARSH grader.
