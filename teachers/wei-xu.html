Her English was extremely difficult to understand. She graded the case and midterm fairly easily, but the final was difficult. She added little to no value to the class with her instruction.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Read from slides, did not actually teach during the course.  She constantly made mistakes with the material  (i.e. she used the antonym of what she actually should have said).  Very hard to follow.  Class was intolerable at times, most people left half way through.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not helpful at all. Did not reference the book at all. She lectured the entire time.  She's tough to understand (accent) and leaves lots of grammar errors in her lecture notes. Makes lots of mistakes. Unfortunately, I would never take her again. Taught myself corporate finance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2010<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does not display any sort of interest at all in her students' learning process.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely the worst prof I've ever had.  Always late to class and just read off of slides the whole time.  Class argued with her constantly because she made so many mistakes and was always wrong.  Made final very difficult and did not curve.  Taught myself the entire class.  Do not take any class she is teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2010<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this professor for FIN555. Let's just say that things started very simple and ended very hard. Dont expect one ounce of personality in the lectures, and expect to teach yourself the material. The lectures became more and more empty as the quarter went on. Book is not needed at all.</div></div></div></body></html>
