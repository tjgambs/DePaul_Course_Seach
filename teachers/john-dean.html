DEAN! He was so great at explaining biology on a level that was easily understood. His passion was so evident and you never had any issues hearing him (he yells when he gets excited). He was absolutely hilarious and an absolute joy to have as a professor. He gets especially fired up talking about plants :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2012<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you get a chance to take this man, DO IT. He is seriously one of the best professors at DePaul and knows what he's talking about. He's really clear and makes a class of 100+ feel wayyy  smaller. Just go to EVERY class and please, TAKE NOTES!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2012<br>Class Name: BIO193<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great lectures but YOU MUST TAKE NOTES!

He explains things pretty clear. The class is a little hard. But you could drop the two worst online quizes and two lab quizes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2011<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor out there. He is so dedicated to his teaching, enthusiastic and he does a fantastic job explaining concepts. He keeps you awake with occasional jokes. Love him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2011<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class because it says he's a chili pepper.... I was waiting for him to come out the first day of class. He's half bald and like in his 40s, not a chili pepper in my opinion! But he's a good teacher, answers questions clearly, repeats himself, he gets boring at times though. But I'd take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2010<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Dean is awesome!!!

He is very enthusiastic about the subject and is always willing to answer questions in depth. He has a good sense of humor and is easy to listen to, I would recommend him to anyone taking bio</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2009<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! He spoke enthusiastically and explained the subject clearly. Although the book helped with the general understanding, the tests were almost completely based on lecture. If you show up, pay attention, and study for the tests there is no reason why you shouldn't succeed. Definitely take him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2009<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Dean makes a great lecturer for his enthusiasm and humor! He is really patient with students in taking the time to answer questions and making himself available. While the lecture material is tricky at first glance, there are plenty of resources that any student could easily access to study for the exams. definitely take Dr. Dean!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Dean is one of the best professors at DePaul! He's a great lecturer, and is always willing and able to answer questions. His tests are moderately difficult, but if you put in some work, you'll do well. The comprehensive section on the final is almost identical to the two exams, and the keys are posted online, so study those for the final! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is really a great professor. I always had a hard time in BIO when I was in high school, but this guy made me really interested in BIO. He doesn't use powerpoints which is actually helpful and he doesn't move on if people are having issues with the material. Take him for BIO and you won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2009<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enthusiastic. Clear. Uses real-life examples. Read the book and go to lectures and you'll get what you need out of the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2009<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found his lecture style boring and hard to pay attention to. Tests are hard but nearly always graded on a curve. He's funny but often goes on long unneccesary tangents.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVED Dr. Dean.  He really makes the subject matter as interesting as he can.  If anyone says he is extremely hard, they're wrong.  It's the material that makes it hard, but Dean does a great job at explaining everything to the best of his ability.  DEFINITELY take him!  He is so funny and I enjoyed going to lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2009<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Dean has been my best teacher at DePaul. He's so knowledgeable and teaches very clearly. I never expected to like plants, but he made it fascinating! While it will seem like there is a massive amount to know for his tests, his tests are extremely, extremely fair. If you can take him, DO! You won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2008<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Dean rocks! Who knew plants could be so interesting&#63; He is crystal clear on topics and is funny (and very very loud) so it's hard not to stay involved. Highly highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: BIO166<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall insteresting class - 2 exams, a final, and a paper. Had a lab portion with quizzes which were a bit hard to study for since material couldn't be studied at home. Grades fairly, speaks loudly, not much work. Class attendance not really mandatory, but extremely recommended. Lectures important.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101GMOS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Opinionated guy, easy course, great class discussions, available, fairly easy grader, interested in helping students.
