Took Discover- Death and the City with him and he is quite the character. Apparently this is an honor's level class.. Did not even know that. If you try, you will get a good grade. Be ready to read one book per week in this class and do a "reading quiz" on it. No tests. One final paper (single spaced? Come on man).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2015<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most chill professors ever. He's a funny guy and will make jokes in class! If you can, ask him about his Ecuador story ("SCREECH!") Took Death and the City for my discover class and whoever spoke about his poor navigation skills was totally on point. I would recommend him to anyone, it's an enjoyable class & we all bonded because of him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2015<br>Class Name: 112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super knowledgeable. Took this guy for my freshman focal point class. Wasn't interested in the subject, it fit into my schedule. But surprisingly he made it interesting. The course work is not heavy at all, which allowed me to really read up on the assign readings. Take him! You won't regret it. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2015<br>Class Name: PHL294<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is really nice and he's great to talk to about outside matters but you have to push him a bit to talk the subject in a way that might resonate. He's cares a bit too much about what the students think of him (copying comedic skits, pretending they're his personal stories) but he's super sweet. Nice guy. Just wants students to like him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2015<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easily my favorite professor. If you're into philosophy at all, Ben is your guy. Extremely knowledgable and interesting lectures. Take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2015<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool guy, great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2014<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty funny guy, he makes the class more interesting. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2014<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ben's the best. He's really nice and helpful, full of hilarious stories, and really really knows the information. Just don't let him try to navigate around Chicago, it's best if someone just pulls out their phone and does it for him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ben is really funny and you can tell he is super knowledgable. He's honest and says whatever is on his mind. Very young and refreshing professor. As long as he can tell you worked really hard on an assignment, you'll get an A. Assignments aren't excessive and you have a lot of time to work on them. He isn't very strict on due dates either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly recommend this professor! The assignments are minimal and he goes over the readings in class, 1 pg papers are due every other week, he is considerate with due dates, and is he is easy to get a hold of. The class itself is alright but he does a good job of making it interesting and although he is cynical he really entertaining.  TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really boring class. curses a lot to try to be "cool". unnecessarily hard grader. papers are pointless. avoid this guy at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>terrible teacher, not interesting at all or helpful. the content is nonsense.I do not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: PHL240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really helpful; able to contact by email</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's awesome!

He always tries to keep students interested and helps in any way he can. Definitely must take!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ben is an amazing professor. He is extremely helpful and you will always get the grade you deserve. He definitely rewards effort. I reccomend this class to everyone. Very insightful and you get your money's worth from this class. The material is not easy, but with Ben's help it's managable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher with a great sense of humor. Keeps the class interesting through provoking discussion of the philosophical concepts explored within the various texts read throughout the quarter. The reading material can be heavy on the wording but the prof. explains it very well during lecture. Would take again any day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely helpful, insightful, and a professor one should take at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2011<br>Class Name: PHIL240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2010<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a huge fan of philosophy, but Ben makes it painless. He is hilarious and easy going, he is also very helpful. 3 Case studies make up the majority of the grade, and if you have him read them first and offer suggestions you will definitely succeed. Definitely take Ben!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2010<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome teacher!! he makes the readings so easy to understand. you can send him your case studies before they are due and he gives you feedback, so you can fix it before you get a grade. TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2010<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so awesome and super funny, class was a few 1 page papers and a final paper, no tests, definitely would take him again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Made my morning class worth coming to.

First day of class he took his shoes off and taught the class and just made us comfortable. Mini cases were easy, do the homework which is just 3 assignments and show that you're paying attention. You'll get a decent grade. I got an A and I thought I was going to get at least a B-!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ben is awesome. He is hilarious, totally willing to help, and a decently easy grader. If you prove that you are trying and you do your assignments, you'll be fine. It's impossible to be stressed in his class. Totally take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably one of my favorite teachers at DePaul. There's a lot of writing involved and he can be a tough grader, but he drops the lowest grades. The subject is boring, but he does his best to make it interesting. He's pretty funny as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2010<br>Class Name: PHL242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for Business Ethics. Very easy and straightforward. Pay attention to class discussions and email him with any questions. He's available to help you. He'll look at your work before you turn it in and give you suggestions to improve it for a better grade. He's funny too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teaches a very dry subject in a dry manner. He knows the subject material is difficult so he tries to make it understandable for everyone. There is a two page paper due each week, but he drops the lowest few. Has a bizarre formula to help you boost your grade at the end. I got four Cs on my papers, then the rest were As, so I got an A in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a cool guy. A paper is due every week, but if you don't understand something, he is ecstatic when you ask for help. No tests or quizzes, but the class is a bit boring. It's easy to lose focus when you're not interested, and he looks above you instead of at you. I do recommend him though, he made philosophy less of a hassle.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ben is a nice guy. Really funny too. He also acknowledges that philosophy is difficult, and tries to accommodate people. His class can get a little monotonous, but otherwise, is fun and interesting. His one fault, in my view, is his lack of use of Blackboard. Frustrating.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2008<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He acknowledges its a subject many are compelled to take, not out of curiosity. He tries hard to be availiable to help and responds to email quickly. He gives a huge amount of notes every lecture. He wants people to get past the meaning of the topics at first glance and delve further into the text. I got an A but did a lot of work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a little crazy but really funny. He kind of looks homeless and wears the same clothes all the time but he knows what he is talking about but it's hard to sit through a class when you don't like or understand philosophy. Still, he is eager to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2008<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At times he was all over the place, but it was his first time teaching. He was always willing to help students, which is nice. He's a pretty cool guy I guess.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had no idea what was ever going on in class. However, he always has office hours if you ever need help, which is nice. He really wants you to participate, but it was hard too for most of us who had no idea what was going on. He's pretty cool tho.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2007<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
