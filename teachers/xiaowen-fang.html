Topics are really easy such as create a social media account and write about your experience. If you need to boost your GPA definitely take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: IS208<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gives 100% on almost all papers, don't need to try in that class if taken online.

His notes even mention Windows 2000 as if it were still being used.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2012<br>Class Name: CSC583<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Material was tough, professor was easy.  He didn't do a great job at explaining beyond the book and his examples during class, but was very helpful outside of class.  Very quickly grades and gives feedback, and also responds to emails VERY quickly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2012<br>Class Name: ECT436<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor who knows his stuff and is willing to help.

However, he usually will not budge on the deadlines, so you will need to stay on top of those.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2011<br>Class Name: ECT250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest course I have taken.  Absolutely loved it! I took the online course.  I will say though, you DO NOT need the expensive textbook.. I haven't even opened it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2010<br>Class Name: ECT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A if you put in the work. I never watched the lectures, just went over the notes before an assignment was due. He grades VERY quickly and answers emails usually within an hour or 2. I highly recommend taking this class with him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2010<br>Class Name: ECT330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He lectures well with great notes.  He is also very organized and responds to emails very quickly.  If you really want to learn web design, take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: ECT250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm a Commerce Major and I needed a Science-Elective Course. I couldn't ask for a more EASIER Course. Just 5 assignments are submitted online, midterm is open note OPEN LAPTOP (yeah you can bring your laptop) and the final exam was take home. I took the Monday night class. Everyone is set for a A if you just complete the assignments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2009<br>Class Name: ETC250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had the online class and it was Great. Super Super EASY! The assignments (5 total) are once every other week and SUPER EASY. It was great, and the midterm and final are online - Great</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: ECT250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know how the actual lecture class is but if you take the online section you will be happy.  I got a hundred on all five assignments (which was 5th grade level work) and did good on the midterm and final...the answers come almost work for word from the ppt.  Do yourself a favor and take this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: ECT250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm glad I took the online class. I learned plenty of things through his power point presentations. The work and midterm are easy.You should take his class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: IT230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher, but at times difficult to understand what he is saying. Teaches the entire class through the use of examples. I bought two books for the class that were listed as required, didn't use a single one. Grading is fair and fast, overall a good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: SE583<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I spent 4 weeks doing the final project but got no grade and no comments on it. No exam was pretty sweet so you focus on the project. Very quick to grade assignments, sometimes in just an hour or two.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: ECT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This Professor is the best!!! He's very clear, teaches better than most professors that I've taken!!! I don't understand how some students gave this professor a low review. Blame yourselves first before you blame a great professor such as him!! I hope to take more courses, he's the best!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2007<br>Class Name: ECT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To date the least interesting professor I have had at DePaul. While his lecture notes are handy, I found that there was little incentive to actually come to class. All he would do during a lecture is display his lecture notes (in .doc form, which was not particularly easy to read  for those of us who lack 20/20 vision) and read them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2006<br>Class Name: ECT583<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was very easy for me and I did not know ASP.  Grading was gentle and fair.  HW was related to topics taught!  Yes, thick accent, dull, and simply doesn't answer questions like others posted.  Showed no enthusiasm and looked pretty bored and dissapointed in class for some reason.  Needs passion. He knows his stuff, wish he teached it better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: ECT583<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the course was about .net and the guy did not know what J# is. He never answered any question properly. I don't know if this was because he did not understand the questions or because he did not know the answers, but NEVER take this class with the guy. He was funny though...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2006<br>Class Name: IT430S105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found his Lecture notes Extremely Helpful. The Projects are very very similar to his notes. Just by some tweaking I pulled of an easy A. I don't know why others are so negative about prof. Fang.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: IT230<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TERRIBLE just TERRIBLE. The worst professor i've had at DePaul. He does not explain anything well. His class is dull and boring. His final was completly differnt from assignments. Expects everyone to know asp.net once you step into class. Homework easy test HARD AS HELL.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2005<br>Class Name: ASPCLASS<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: IT430<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Fang is a very enthusiathic instructor and he likes to solve colding problems for student. Most of his handout are codings and may scare students with no programmaning exp bfe. I didn't have any IT background but still can get a good grade at end. Just understand his handout and do hw by urself, u will learn a lot! Grading is gererous.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: IT230<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Would not take the class again. Moves fast, just gives you examples and expects you to put together a website for a final project while only teaching you how to process code. I'd suggest having a background in at least some previous programming and HTML. Hard to understand but prompt email feedback!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: IT230<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No midterm or final just a presentation and a final project.  Shows examples of what the homework should look like.  Easy grader but just can't understand when he speaks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: ECT353<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
