The homework is easy to understand. If you do the midterm and final study guides, then you shouldn't earn less than a B+ on both exams. Her lectures are like watching paint dry. Some of the in-class activities are boringpointless. The group project was pretty easy. Would take again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2014<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was OK.  Best part of the class was reading the book "The Goal."  Mid-term and final aren't too tough because she gives you a study guide.  Didn't learn as much as I would've liked.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: MGT504<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Landuyt had a lot of real world experience which brought a lot to the course. She is very dedicated to honing her craft, constantly evaluates how she teaches, and finds ways to improve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2013<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very well taught class. She will show recent events in the global market and have very good prediction on how the market top companies will be. There are a lot of fun videos to watch in class (BMW,UPS..etc). In general she makes this class easy and not boring (I'm very happy to have taken this class with her)overall take this class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2013<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class, with very little work involved.  Only the simplest of math.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2013<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests are challenging even though she tells you everything that will be on them and gives you the formulas. Grades very easily on paper, presentation and discussion board exercises.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2011<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class online and the content was structured very well. The lecture videos she had were basically directly off of the slides which were also provided. Really interesting case studies relevant to the week's reading. Tests as well as quizzes were pretty easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2010<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She keeps the class fresh with many teaching tools each class (current events, videos, lectures, team assignments).  Also provides a list of material on mid-term and final.  All in all a good teacher for a boring topic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2010<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are parts of this class that are interesting, but the majority will have you mentally preparing the remainder of your life just to stay awake. Its boring, but the topic is fairly interesting. Her tests are very easy. There is one simple paper with a short presentation, and 3 very simple online quizzes. Overall, very easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2009<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took the course online, which involved a series of podcasts that left something to be desired. Course is very easy so long as you do what's required of you. Very easy A and interesting to see how stats come into some of these operational measures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2009<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was pretty interesting. Gayle is very knowledgeable and brings her real life experience to class. Made class interesting and it went by pretty quickly. Definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2009<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Landuyt has many years of operations management experience, which she applies to classroom concepts.  Class participate is a must.  She gives 2 tests and a 5-page paper.  The tests are fairly easy since she gives out a study guide that outlines exactly what is on the test.  She is an easy grader.  I learned a lot from this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2009<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Landuyt is very nice but it's obvious that she is excellent at Operations Management because she is boring and not very interested in the students.  The class could have been designed to be more engaging but she choose the easy way out by reading slides.  Easy grader, no textbook needed but be prepared to punch yourself in the face in boredom.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class- don't buy the book. Study guide tells you exactly what's on the test, and the powerpoints are posted online. She's a sweet lady who's very knowledgeable about the subject, but unfortunately for her- the nature of operations management is pretty boring. So be prepared to text everyone in your phone book or bring a laptop.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly recommend taking Prof. Landuyt's course.  Her tests are straightforward. She provides a study guide with all of the req'd info.  Her lectures are very intersting.  Her professional experience adds a great deal to the class.  Class requires a fair amount of reading.  Getting a good grade is easy if you are willing to earn it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seems to hate her students but loves what she teaches.  She has a lot of real world experience. After class she has no interest talking to anyone even in the hallways.  You can learn a lot from the textbook.  She has a lot of cool videos to show.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gayle shows a lot of enthusiasm and dedication during this course.  She brings real life experience to lecture.  The class meets every other week.  Online quizzes, discussions, two exams, and a paper with presentation (3 min).  Overall, good teacher for MGT 502.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2007<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she passes around the same attendance sheet which has each week next to ur name and u just initial it. I would barely go to class and i would initial days i didnt attend class. quizes are easy. and overall its an easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2007<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent instructor.

One group project,midterm, final. She makes the class interesting for most of the topics.  She really knows a lot about real world MGT and, unlike some other professors, does a good job at bringing it into the classroom.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2007<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A.

Very fair grading, and strives to bring real world experience to the class. As a professional, she was a product manager at Motorola for years and has lots of great examples and stories.  You MUST take her if you can get into the class before it's full!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2006<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice professor.

Never read the book or met with my group and got an A on the group project, midterm and final.  Just read her powerpoints and try to stay awake in class and you got an A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty easy class.

I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class.

She makes a lot of assumptions that can get annoying to say the least, but her class is interesting, and she knows her stuff.  Test and assignments are not hard, but you need to keep up with the reading and homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2005<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is not too hard if you follow her very detailed directions.

The group project is not that bad. Each person writes about 3 pages and has to present it together. She'll tell you everything you need to know for the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2004<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Straight forward, she tells you what she wants you to know for the exams.
