She is approachable and willing to work with students who  need help.  She's not an easy A, but if you follow her syllabus and instructions you can get an A.  You will do a ridiculous amount of work, but that is the nature of the course and not the fault of the teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2005<br>Class Name: TL405<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Tikoo is the best professor I've ever had. She really knows her stuff and demands excellence from her students. Not an easy A, but recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2005<br>Class Name: TL405<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Tikoo is extremely organized, almost to a fault.  She wants things how she wants them & you must follow to a &quot;T&quot;.  I did well in her class, but worked way more hours for her than should be expected.  The class is too jam packed with information and assignments-- I was on overload most of the quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: TL405<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid this professor, she's horrible!  If you don't do exactly what she says, your grade will suffer (and don't miss class, she'll treat you like crap if you do).  She is very critical, often times rude, and has NEVER even taught in a high school so all you will get is theories.  This is no easy 'A' and if you don't do the work her way, forget it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: TL405METHODS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class, and thought So-Young was great. She is very organized and clear, and always listened & responded to class comments. The only problem is there is so much crucial information in this course, DePaul should split it into 2 or 3 classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2004<br>Class Name: SOPHSEM<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very hard to warm up to.  Passionate lectures but doesn't promote students giving opinions. Very hard grader and if you dont write exactly what she says, your grade suffers badly. Avoid if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2004<br>Class Name: METHODS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>God bless her for trying to teach so much in one quarter. Her class is an enjoyable experience but there is a lot of work to be done and a specific way to do it all</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2004<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Tikoo is the most meticulous person I've ever met! her syllabus is more than 5 pages long, if that means anything.  If you follow all of her crazy details you can get an A but be prepared to spend time on making 4 page outlines and other long assg.</div></div></div></body></html>
