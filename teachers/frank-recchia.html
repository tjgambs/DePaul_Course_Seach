He has a lot of real world accounting experience which turns what could be bland course material into applicable know-how we can use in our professions. He cracks jokes, is upfront on what is on the tests, and can relate experience to coursework. you could not ask for more. take him over anyone else</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2014<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Recchia is a very monotonous lecturer, who can convey the message, but does not do it with lots of charisma. That being said he is a nice guy, its a very straightforward class, and even though the tests are hard, they are manageable if you put the work in. There is a fair amount of homework as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2014<br>Class Name: ACC543<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very kind professor. I wouldn't say he is talented for teaching, but he tries to make everything clear. He is an easy grader, just do the homework and quizzes. He gave A to more than half of the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2014<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Recchia is great. He is a great instructor and will bend over backwards to help students. There is a lot of homework but its not difficult and he goes over everything. Tries to make class enjoyable and doesn't take it too seriously but is a good instructor. Would take again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2014<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Try to avoid him. He gives ALOT of work. He makes you do HW,quiz, and midterm on the same day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2013<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Recchia is the man. If you have a chance, you must take this teacher. His class was not bad for a major accounting course, and he is such a glass half full person, he will make you want to come into class on saturday mornings. He also buys dunkin donuts for his classes on midterm and final days.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2013<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Frank is a great instructor. He understands its not the most interesting course. He tries to keep people engaged and to try to have fun and enjoy their time.

I think he only teaches 3 hr sections so its tough to learn that much in 1 week but he tries his best to break it down and is definitely willing to help if you're struggling</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2012<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had the privilege of taking him for ACC304,305, n 306. Fantastic professor who would give you the shirt off his back to help you. His classes will requires you to study and stay on top of the material but rewarding experience since he just doesn't hand out grades. Wish he taught every accounting class. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2012<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor. One of the best accounting professors at DePaul. Explains the material in a way that is easy to understand and learn. Am taking him again for 306. DePaul needs more professors like him. 40% midterm, 50% final, 10% homework. Material is hard but Recchia makes it easy to get an A. Highly highly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely the best accounting professor I have taken at DePaul, I wish he taught every class. He puts a bunch of resources on D2L. His grading is extremely fair: if you demonstrate you know the material well, he will give you points (its MC). Funny guy, gives words of advice. All around amazing professor!

Will bend over backwards to help you understand the material and do well in his course. He gives you everything you will need to get an A in the class.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor! Mr.Recchia is extremely nice and willing to help. Mr. Recchia gives you all the tools necessary to achieve your desired grade.

You will have to take midterm and final (comprehensive), and homework, which is on Blackboard. Tests are rather tough, but nothing is unexpected. Prof. is a good grader. I would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2010<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dude is a gangsta!!...must take!!...will retake him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2010<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! really cares about his students success! always willing to help you even if you just need some motivation! definitely recommend his class! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2009<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Recchia was an awesome professor. He really tried to get everyone to learn the material and was very fair and helpful. He gave quizzes and handouts for each chapter and mock tests before the final and midterm. He also sets up study sessions before the two exams, which helped tremendously.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To do well simply study off quizes and practice exams. He does not try to trick u, and does put in a healthy curve. The class is boring, and is all based off of ppt that he just reads, and going over h'w that is already on blkbrd, so going to class is really just a waste of time. Get the book! You will need it for the long hour of cramming b4 exams</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard subject but professor is very easy to understand. Exams are straight-forward. The material is difficult to master, but what he tells you to study is exactly the way it is on the exam. The only way to pass is to study hard and pay attention in class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Subject is extremely hard but Professor is really helpful & makes subject so much easier to understand.
