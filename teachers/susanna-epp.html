There is hw due every week and a hw quiz where you just copy down a couple problems from your hw. I found this class to be very easy. She tells you exactly what will be on the midterm and final and reviews everything. Just make sure to go to class, pay attention, take notes, and do the hw and it is an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: MAT141801<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Epp is a very smart and nice lady. While her method of teaching is not the most traditional, i found that they really helped me. If you have any questions, she will answer them in detail. her class can be a bit boring,  but she does try her best to engage everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2012<br>Class Name: MAT141<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible excuse of a class. She tries to help you out but miserably fails. Starts class before hand. The quizzes are a joke, once a week, you copy down the homework onto the quizzes (they're the same problems) and almost all the solutions are in the textbook. What do the students learn? Nothing. This class was a complete waste of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2011<br>Class Name: MAT141<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart lady, knows exactly what she's talking about.  Lucky to have her.  Ask questions if you don't understand, she'll answer.  Power-points are organized and clear.  This is not a typical math class!  HW and quizzes are picky, but she lets you take the quizzes with a partner.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: MAT141<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher. Has a bad grader. The midterm is worth too much rather than homework and quizzes. Takes one point off for every small detail she can find.  Just because someone writes a little sloppy doesn't mean it's unreadable and should be graded fairly along with other papers. Would not recommend her if you are taking MAT 140 or MAT 141.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: MAT141<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seems like a very hard teacher at first. Takes off for ever little minor detail and doesn't explain exactly how she wants proofs written. Despite how hard the class seems, if you do the homeworks and show effort she will give you a decent grade even if your scores are lower... but you need to put a lot of work into this class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2010<br>Class Name: MAT141<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't have any motivation to go to class or take notes. Don't even feel like I'm really learning anything. Completely a waste of my time. My whole life I had never seen a Math teacher use power point slides. She's too strict about little things on the homework. AND no one cares who bought her book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2010<br>Class Name: MAT141<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an awful teacher. I don't know any other Math teacher who uses powerpoints to teach class instead of writing on the board. Marks off for the tiniest of things. Very inconsistent grader. She thinks way to highly of herself because she wrote the book. She just wants everything to be PERFECT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: MAT215<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady but lectures were a complete waste of time.  I would guess 30 min of the 1.5 hr class actually covered material.  HW was about stuff never covered in class.  The presentations weren't hard but were annoying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NOT a good teacher. Is very vague in explaining things and knocks you off for everything. Be prepared to work very hard on homework and other things in order to get a decent grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2004<br>Class Name: MAT140141<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, explains everything perfectly and all she expects is you to show up and try. Is kind of picky on homework and tests but is willing to discuss and if you pay attention in class and do hw you will be prepared for tests...and weekly quizzes bu</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very picky on all assignments and activities.

She is fun and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2004<br>Class Name: MAT660<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Will tell you to make sure you to know things on a review and then will not even put it on the exam.  Exams are too long for a short period of allotted time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2004<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY fair and helpful in MAT 140, 141</div></div></div></body></html>
