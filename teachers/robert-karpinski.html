Dr. K is literally one of the coolest professors I have ever run into, mainly because he is just a wonderful human being. He is so intelligent and so compassionate and he understands the way that education should work. I wish I could have him for more classes. If you are a smart cookie you will take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2014<br>Class Name: REL180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy. Understands that we're college students, and knows it's just a requirement for most of us. I was born and raised a Catholic and learned more about the religion than I have my whole life. Didn't mind being in his class on a Thursday night</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2014<br>Class Name: REL180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. K's class was awesome!  I learned a lot about Catholicism.  He is a very down to earth guy that understands students.  He shares some very interesting stories and real world examples during class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2014<br>Class Name: REL180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. K is undoubtedly one of the best prof at DePaul.  His  course  was very exciting, I learned a lot of things about the Catholic religion. He explained well his lecture and give us all the info that we need. In short,he is AWESOME !

If I had any problems it would be he graded the work really late but I ended up with an A!  I probably learned more about religion in 10 weeks than in religious classes that are year long!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2012<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors ever! I took the class over Summer and wished it was a 10 week class. He has a great presence about him that makes you want to pay attention and be present for every class. As for the workload, it's adequately planned for the length of class time. Three quizzes, response paper and group proj. Take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2012<br>Class Name: REL227<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I have ever had.
