She is very passionate about her work and will help you better your scientific knowledge. I loved taking her classes (about 3 or 4 of them) Plus she's hot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2009<br>Class Name: BIO260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a sweet teacher! Very concerned with student grades and nice during lab. The field of genetics is boring and confusing, and this teacher allows you to tolerate that. Got an A by pretending that I liked the subject and committing to the work involved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2008<br>Class Name: BIO260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  She explains the material very slowly which means it was easy to keep up if you tried.  Tests were clear.  A good grade is very doable if you keep up with homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: HON220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Food: Fuel for Life. This was her first class in the honors program she taught and she did well for a bunch of non-science majors.  I was minimally interested in the subject and i did not think her lectures were boring.  Also, do not bother getting the book, it is $80 and the reading is not required (or even tested on).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: BIO260<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY BORING!! Both the teacher and the class are boring.  She is very monotone, and if you ask her too many questions she will make you feel an inch tall.  She doesn't quite grasp the fact the sometimes students just don't understand a concept and she needs to explain it better, which she fails to do.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2006<br>Class Name: GENETICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Dr. Silliker...I mean the lecture notes are sort of scattered sometimes and sometimes I think too much time was spent on easily learned concepts but overall I love her and will be taking her again. She was very helpful even outside of class and genuinely interested in her field and teaching it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: BIO260GENETIC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a wonderful person.  Very helpful in lab and office hours.  However, she is horribly un-organized in lecture.  Its as if she threw together a lecture 20 minutes beforehand.  You will get lost in lecture unless you stay on top of EVERYTHING she says.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2006<br>Class Name: BIO260<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A geneticist that can’t do basic math and when you’re predicting a future generation’s genotypic frequencies, it’s definitely a plus to be able to multiply ½ by ½.  And class…ultra boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2005<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All I have to say is BOOORRRING. Learned more in lab than in the actual class. Lucky to have escaped with a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2005<br>Class Name: BIO260<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Monotone voice is all I can say... I'm sure she knows her stuff but she has difficultity in explaning and communicating it to the students.  Had she not posted her notes online I would be lost because she goes too fast and speaks very low.  Practice tests were a big help, as were the labs.  But my advice is to drink a huge late before lecture</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2005<br>Class Name: BIO260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Dr. Silliker! Her lectures are kinda boring, but very clear. She is very helpful in lab. Her midterms were not all that difficult as long as you study what's on the objective sheet. The final was much more difficult, but she curves. She is super nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2005<br>Class Name: BIO260<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice in lab and she is a nice person, but her lectures are sorta boring. I really liked the book for the class, so if you do the assigned problems and read you will be ok with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2005<br>Class Name: BIO260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Forget you guys.

Her jokes are funny regardless of what other people say (and sometimes sexy). The last two tests are more difficult than intially represented.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2004<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>(Distractingly sexy but) a fantastic lecturer.  I took this class as an English major and the work almost killed me--but it was fascinating, well-presented, and totally appropriate.  Great professor; highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2004<br>Class Name: MOLECULAR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures are pointless but you have to go to class in order to figure out what's on the test. If she spent more time preparing her lectures instead of trying to be the &quot;Cool Prof.&quot; she would be an awsome teacher. Hotness ..well if sex gets m</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2004<br>Class Name: GENETICS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very hard tests but huge curves. tries to make lectures interesting with jokes but most of the time they are extremely boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2004<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures were boring, but she knew what she was talking about.  Tests were really difficult if you didn't remember what you read in the book.  She's pretty funny at times, and really approachable.  Overall a good teacher, but you need to be dedicated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2004<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her test are very different from lecture, test are too detailed and long..expects everyone in bio 101 to be a bio major or to want to go to med school</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2004<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good teacher!  She basically feels that since she knows the material (which she should since she has been teaching it for a long time!) that everyone else should know it, but even more importantly understand it with as much as ease as she does!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2003<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a good professor. She shows enthusiasm about the topic taught. Sometimes she is sidetracked, but in a funny way. However, she is slow on the lectures and tries to speed up at the end. Any unclarity, ask her or approach the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2003<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For the most part, fairly easy to understand.  Makes herself available and always will talk with you after class if you have any questions.  Tests are by no means a cakewalk, but if you actually come to lecture and take good notes you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2003<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Real nice teacher, but the lectures are so boring.  I sleep during them and the lectre was completley full now its only half the number.  Basically you don't even have to go to class if u just read the book and show up for the tests   you'll be ok.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2003<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is hard not to be clear when you teach from powerpoints direct from the book. If you read the book accordingly you shouldnt bore yourself with class. The tests are hard. Nice person though, very helpful in labs. You have to take her so good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2003<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring and HARD TESTING</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2003<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was SOOO boring!!!  If you have a choice between her and Funk...choose Funk!  She just dictated all of her notes straight from the Powerpoint she presented to us.  The tests were hard, too!</div></div></div></body></html>
