You have to put in very little work, but all of the Renaissance material is interesting and seeing it all over the city is tons of fun. It was my last choice for an explore class but tons of fun and really easy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2015<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very inspiration woman. If the class as a whole is struggling, she adjusts the syllabus to fit the class, not the other way around. Also, you get a whole letter grade on your essays for seeing local Shakespeare plays. Considering there are only three essays, it's huge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2015<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor McQuade is the best teacher I have ever had in my entire life. She is an inspiration and a wonderful woman. If you need help, just ask and she'll be there. Her class is extremely interesting and if I could, I would take every class with her. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2015<br>Class Name: ENG280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>McQuade is AMAZING. She facilitates great discussion and is open to all opinions in understanding the literature. She does offer her own opinion, and encourages students to challenge her. She is a must take professor and genuinely cares about her students. Her main goal is to get students to learn and appreciate wonderful works of literature. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: ENG280<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Truly dedicated and awesome teacher.

She really knows her stuff about Shakespeare and is great at leading interesting discussions about his plays. It's a very discussion based class. Her papers often have simple prompts, but you can really write about whatever you want. Extra credit is going to see plays she recommends! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super nice and into what she's doing, which always helps keep the class interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2014<br>Class Name: ENG320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice lady who genuinely loves what she teaches. Her classes are mostly just her reading the text aloud and helping you understand what is going on in it, which is helpful for papers but can get a little boring if you're not interested in the readings. She wants you to do well but won't hand out A's for poorly written work. I'd recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: ENG380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Easily one of my favorite professors at DePaul. Incredibly nice, and more passionate about literature than I've seen anyone else in my life. Will get extremely excited about the books we are reading, and helps you have fun reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had McQuade for 2 classes, Renaissance & Milton. One of the best, she really cares about her students, & takes time to help with any questions about papers or text. It is not easy to get an A in her class, but work your ass off, and you will!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: ENG320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite professors in the English department (along with Selinger)! She's extremely intelligent, but not intimidating - totally approachable, helpful, and passionate about what she does. I will definitely be taking more classes with her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2010<br>Class Name: ENG472<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love love love her! She makes difficult concepts seem easy to grasp and she is obviously extremely intelligent. One of the best professors I have had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2010<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a fun teacher! I had her for Restoration Literature and she was phenominal. We had just one paper, and the midterm was take-home. I realy learned alot about Milton too. Excellent teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2009<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Full of enthusiasm, brings intensity to the discussion, truly engages students.  She's fantastic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: ENG320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is my second class taking McQuade. I love her, she's really helpful on texts that are difficult to understand, and she genuinely enjoys class discussion. She does a lot of close reading of the texts, which for Renaissance Lit. really helps with furthering your understanding rather than loading you down with secondary sources.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2008<br>Class Name: ENG329<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>McQuade is the BEST professor I've had at DePaul hands down.  She understands that the purpose of education is to be engaged--not stressed by useless busy work.  TAKE HER!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2008<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate Shakespeare, but this class made it bareable. It was intresting and even fun at times, she really encouraged class participation and free-thought on the plays; so that other person must have just got a bad grade. If you still need to fill this requirement I would take her for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WONDERFUL!  Ms. McQuade really knows her stuff.  I will be taking her again.  EASY class. 2 papers, 10 quizzes.  Brought new light to Shakespeare.  She challenges what you know and your argument so be prepared to use the text.  Take her, you'll never forget it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2007<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I utterly loathed her class! One of the most close minded profs at DePaul. Her own view of the piece is the only view. She's a good prof. if you're some kind of yes-man willing to have one idea crammed down your throat.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2007<br>Class Name: ENG320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her for Renaissance lit.  Great teacher who is quite engaging when it comes to the material.  You can tell she really loves the subject and tries her best to keep you interested.  The discussions are great as well.  Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: ENG320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's really laid-back! so nice and helpful, class discussions were engaging and fun. she told us she's going to be taking a break until fall 07&#63;&#63; but take her if you get the opportunity!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Paula is a great teacher. She is very receptive and enjoys her students. She welcomes and embraces other opinions. She made Shakespeare very accessible and interesting to analyze. Will definitely take her again. Class breakdown: 6 plays, 6 pop quizzes on the reading (she drops lowest quiz grade), two 5-6 page papers. Great class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her enthusiasm is contagious.

She is such a cool professor-- except she doesn't let her class know when she won't be there.. so you end up taking the train the next morning with no sleep just to find out class is cancelled, and you don't have another class until hours later! But still, easy A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2005<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>McQuade is an AMAZING Professor. She's very bubbly which keeps the class flowing and the vibe very positive.  If you come to class and pay attention and visit sparknotes before classes you &quot;feel&quot; there will be a pop quiz then there's no reason why you would get anything less than an A.  I love her and plan on taking her as much as I can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2005<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was really easy. I hardly went and still got a B in the class. If you don't really like poetry (like me) then you should take her. It's an easy grade and she's a sweet person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: SHAKESPEARE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. McQuade is wonderful!  She is excellent at presenting altering interpretations of Shakespeare's works.  Lectures are extermely intersting, she encourages participation- over all, I highly recommend this prefessor.  2 papers, little quizzes- not hard.  TAKE THIS CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is intelligent, passionate, enthusiastic, genuine, charismatic and approachable.  I looked forward to every class! Thanks to her, I also finally learned to appreciate and understand poetry.  When I grow up I want to be Paula McQuade!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is awesome.

From her unabashed crush on John Donne to her fabulous explications and class dicussions on &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; she's the model of what a helpful, engaged-with-the-students English teacher should be.  She's also just a really enthusiastic person...and gorgeous.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2005<br>Class Name: SHAKESPERE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, she is a very knowledgeable person, and she is a fun teacher, however she did get me mad, as part of her tests were to match the quote with the charachter. Well I sucked at this, and got a C. She then said she was getting rid of it for the next quarter....sigh!

Her pop quizzes are really stupid, but it's not a hard class.  If you don't like/understand Shakespeare, I would recommend taking her class.
