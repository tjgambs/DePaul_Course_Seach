She is incredibly smart and definitely the best professor in the program. She is willing to spend as much time as needed helping students outside of class and truly wants everyone to pass. She is amazing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: NSG322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Margaret is the best professor that I have encountered in this program so far.

She is the smartest, and the most willing to spend extra time until you understand everything.  She may seem intimidating at first, but she just has a very string personality.  She is funny too.  Helps during a 4 hour lecture!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2009<br>Class Name: NURS322<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok so everyone will make you think she is the worst prof. you'll ever meet.
