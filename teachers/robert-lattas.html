I thought the class was interesting work but I couldn't get over the fact at how rude(some say sarcastic) he was towards students and people in general.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Taking Acc 102 with Professor Lattas, A.K.A Bob was probably one of the best decisions I made my freshman year at DePaul. Bob is a no BS kind of guy and you can see that in his homework, test, and quizes. In the end I would defiantly recommend you take him to invest in your future, he just might invest in yours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2013<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very sarcastic; I loved it.  I didn't like his style of throwing us into a complicated assignment before explaining how to do it (though it wasn't graded)  Other than that, his grading was very lenient and he *tried* to find points if possible.  If you can stand a 4 hours night class I would definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2013<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By no mean he is a bad person, just full of sarcasm. Need to read the book and do homework by yourself before class, mostly self-study. He just solve problems in class and teach just a little bit about it. Real world experience & tips. Totally not recommend if you want to learn, not memorize. Talk very fast and give headache, but easy exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2012<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Says it the way it is and will not tolerate ignorance in the classroom.  Demands respect, but also gives it.  Runs his classroom like a business and he expects everyone to be prepared for class, show up on time AND NOT USE YOUR CELL PHONE WHILE IN CLASS.  Best professor I had at DePaul because he has real world experience too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lattas is an excellent teacher. As long as you come to class prepared, take the time to pay attention and do the assigned problems you will succeed. If I was confused he was available to help clarify through office hours and via email. I would definitely take another one of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Lattas is a great prof. He may seem kind of cocky but he knows what he's talking about. He goes over every HW problem so make sure you're prepared cause he will call on you, he just doesn't collect it. He tells you what kind of problems to study for the midterm and final. He's active during class and keeps class upbeat. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DePaul's best professor.  Brilliant, funny, successful, and passionate.  The attributes of what every professor should be.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can tell that Professor Lattas has a passion for teaching.  More importantly, he has experience and knows how business works!  You e-mail him, he e-mails you back immediately.  He is always available to chat before or after class and during office hours.  He cares about his students...he got a bunch of us jobs!  I mean...what more do you want!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall good professor. Teaching method is odd, it will take some getting used to. If your lazy and don't do what he tells you, you will fail no doubt. If you take him, plan on spending a lot of time reviewing. 3 quizzes, midterm, and a final. I'm escaping with an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2010<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very funny professor. You must have the homework done for the chapters to be taught that week because goes over homework during class. He tells you what you need to know. 2 exams, 2 take home quizzes & Final. Must take!</div></div></div></body></html>
