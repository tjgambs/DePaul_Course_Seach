He had no idea how to teach, just rambled on, sometimes about things not pertaining to our class.  The textbook was horrible.  He required a lot of reading, while only discussing a fraction in lecture.  He claimed everything was &quot;fair game&quot; if it was in the book.  My advice: FIND ANOTHER HISTORY TEACHER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: HIST218<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this professor was awfull , he was a very poor judge of historical talent and was about as interesting as staring up at a desk for 3 hours. Also he was a very poor grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2006<br>Class Name: HST218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really nice and understanding.

He also gave us a study guide for mid-terms. He is a nice guy and tries to make history fun. I recommend him and he only asks for one paper that is about 1000 words. He is really easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2006<br>Class Name: HISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
