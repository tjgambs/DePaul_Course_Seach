She expects a lot out of her students, but if you keep up with the readings (all provided through library reserves) and apply yourself you will get a lot out of the class. This is not a blow off, easy A kinda professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2006<br>Class Name: CMM114<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't believe anyone would even think about giving this teacher a positive rating! This class was horrible!! I couldn't even bare to go back to class after the break b/c I was bored to death. EHHH</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2006<br>Class Name: CMN206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was challenging and painful but informative. If you take tallies of the number of times that she interrupts herself to sip her Coke you will not be bored :) The exam preparation is extremely lacking...but I blame most of my frustration on the class and their inability to participate...only three people ever spoke. LAME!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2006<br>Class Name: CMN206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good.  Good lectures.  Very nice and knows her stuff.  But, she expects you to do all the reading and can be a tough grader.  All in all, I learned more than I have in other classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2006<br>Class Name: FILMHISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite prof this semester by far.  Knows a LOT about film and I really liked her lectures.  She has lots of ideas that make you think about movies in a new way.  I actually enjoyed going to class for once.  But there is a lot of reading and it takes time to study for the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2006<br>Class Name: FILM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professr, and super smart.  Very good at explaining things.  Made subject really interesting but be prepared to take notes.  I'd definitly take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2006<br>Class Name: CMN206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good lord, this woman needs to find a new job because teaching, especially this subject, is not it.  I hated this class so much, as well as my life for three straight hours, ending at 9 on the dot, and listening to her talk was absolutely excrutiating!!! You either want to come ****, drugged up or pass out from wasting 3 hours of your life</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: CMN206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher ever. Listen to all of these comments. They speak the truth. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER. the class is so PAINFUL you will want to CRY. No, you will want to KILL YOURSELF. A potentially fun class gone all wrong when this woman decided to teach it. If you dismiss these comments and take her class you are a moron and deserve the suffering</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: CMN206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher, could quite possibly...wait I take that back.  This teacher IS THE WORST TEACHER I have ever had in my entire life.  She has the worst teaching style and if you are going to take this class, do not pick her!! Material is intersting and has the potential to be fun, except her constant monotone, pipsqueak of a voice makes you hate life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2006<br>Class Name: DC206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst teacher I've had at Depaul. Three hour lectures that you will want to bring your laptop...or a couple cyanide pills to. She is monotone and quiet, making it extremly hard to be interested. Also picks the worst movies to show as examples of history. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2006<br>Class Name: CMN206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is, by far, the worst teacher I have ever had.  Not only do I hate my life when I am in her 3 hour class from hell,  but she is so monotone and quiet that it is just excrutiating!! There are so many amazing professors in the CMN dept. that I am extremely surprised she is still here!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was ok.  Class was mostly lectures with some video clips.  Her style of lecturing can be hard to follow sometimes, but if you can keep it--that's what her tests are mainly based on.  Taking notes helped me a lot.  Also, lots of reading material, but I found them to be interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2006<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER!!!!I guarantee she will not be teaching for long, she is absolutely the worst teacher I've ever had. I was actually interested in the content of the class, but she made showing up to class like getting ready for 3 hrs. of torture.  Her tests suck, most of the class failed. Bottom line she's a clown, what else can I say...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hands down the worst cmn teacher at depaul...the most unhelpful, boring teacher i've ever had. trust me! avoid her at all cost. her testing style does not fit the class, her content doesnt teach you anything about communication. waste of time and money if you take her, you'll regret it !</div></div></div></body></html>
