Eiron is the funniest science professor I have ever had and also tells great stories. He made sure that students knew exactly what they were doing for their final projects and made sure to give them individual help during the class period. Take him if you like muscles.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2015<br>Class Name: HLTH301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>The content of any AnatomyPhysiology class is going to be very difficult, but Eiron makes you want to understand the concepts and mechanisms happening.  I've come out of this class knowing more information that I thought possible and he is always very available to students- has out-of-class reviews, responds to emails quickly. Def would take again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2015<br>Class Name: HLTH301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was very clear and made an effort to make sure everything understood every concept.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2014<br>Class Name: HLTH202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first, I didn't mind that he was good looking. By the end of the quarter, I couldn't comprehend what he was saying to me because it's hard not to be distracted by the man's muscles bulging through his shirt, his huge stature, his voice. Don't take if you're actually looking to learn. Scientists shouldn't be allowed to be hot. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: HLTH202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Cudaback makes himself available to students, and is great about answering emails. He is more than willing to give you all the help you ask for. He likes to challenge you to think critically, and will help you get to the answer without giving it away. He tailors the info to the class's interests. I would take him again in a heartbeat!</div></div></div></body></html>
