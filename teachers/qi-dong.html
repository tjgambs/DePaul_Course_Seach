Material was pretty much review for me since I had taken this class in High School. Nonetheless, Professor Qi Dong did a good job at going over the material. Online hw assignments suck. They can be very time-consuming towards the later chapters.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2014<br>Class Name: ECO333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Qi Dong knows a lot about China and discusses it often.

I don't think you would have to read, but I did. Gives you quizzes and practice multiple choice. Yes self study basically and if ppl around you do bad enough she curves.

Doable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2012<br>Class Name: ECON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had failed Microeconomics and was taking it for the second time.  Dr. Dong was very effective as a great professor, especially in comparison to other economics professors that I have taken.  Her lectures are clearly explained and she makes sure that everyone in the class understands the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: ECO334<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Dong is very straightforward in her tone and exams. She states specific points needed for exams and presentations, so pay attention to her announcements and take notes. Little or no use of textbook. However, Prof. Dong doesn't have much of a personality and sense of humor; she's very serious. Easy A if you just pay attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2012<br>Class Name: ECO334<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is boring as sin, she doesn't give clear guidelines for presentations, and she embarrassed one of my classmates in front of everyone for missing a couple class sessions.  She has no respect for anyone.  Better to graduate late than take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2012<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very hard to understand, and she speaks very quietly. Be prepared to study independently. Tests weren't that tough. Avoid if you have issues with accents or language barriers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2011<br>Class Name: ECO333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>According to her, no one deserves to get a 100% on any assignment. Her accent, but mostly her poor understanding of the English language makes her even more difficult to understand. She's brilliant, but can't communicate at all. She treats people like idiots for asking questions, regardless of the quality of question. AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2011<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The textbook is dense and the powerpoints are missing key information, so studying alone is a chore.

Pretty easy class, but gets boring, basic powerpoint lecture. midterm and final are straight forward. homework is easy, plus it's all online so you dont have to waste money for a book. i usually get out at least 20 mins early</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2009<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't think she was terribly hard to understand, she has an accent but its not bad. But her lectures were so boring and the content of the class was so easy that I skipped nearly every class, taught myself from the online textbook, showed up for the midterm & final and got an A in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2009<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you can't understand ECO would not recommend the Professor. You hardly can't understand what she is saying and she uses power-point and reads it through, which each student could do. I spoke to her becuse I had hard time understanding the class and she wasn't a big help. In my opinion she shouldn't be teaching at DePaul at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i loved her. She was not that bad... the online book and homework was good. The homework was challenging but not impossible and her tests were not bad if you study.

This has nothing to do with her being foreign,she is a horrible teacher she reads off her slides tht probably came with the book.she does not go over everythng that will be on the exam.her tests are very difficult. I read and did the hw she was horrible!!! Do not take!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: ECO334<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes she is hard to understand but knows her stuff.

Just study and pay attention in class and you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really like her! She is a little hard to understand at first... however, she is a great teacher! I found she explained everything so well during class I hardly had to look at my notes to do hw. I studied for 20 minutes before the midterm and got a 90. TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>okay i dont know what a few of you are talking about! she is one of the worst teachers at depaul. you can barely understand her and have to take a 17-25 question quiz online every week! if you can avoid her, DO IT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is passionate and wants you to learn. The textbook is online along with all of the homework and is due at the end of the week (Sunday at 11:59pm). Mid-term and final are pretty easy, just study and you'll be fine! Take her, you will have a challenge and learn a lot, and have a good laugh along the way! Definitely one of the best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2008<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a little hard to understand at times but she still wants to be helpful. She always asks if there are any questions and provides PLENTY of material to help you study. I recommend her. Just don't be a slacker.

This is truly a class where you must teach yourself, altho her slides are helpful if you can understand them. As usual, often unclear or hard to understand. mid/final, 2 quizes. book=useless, just use slides off BB.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2007<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is horrible & it has nothing to do with the fact that she is foreign.  Her quizzes/tests have ambiguous questions & are extremely hard.  Class average is in the 60's.

STAY AWAY!!!! She goes through lengthy powerpoint presentations that she didn't even make, talks WAYYYY to fast, its hard to understand her, her tests are long and hard, and the list goes on.
