Often says she wants to hear from online students if they have any questions, and wants to skype with you. However, when you actually email her, her responses are rude and provide little to no help at all. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2015<br>Class Name: CSC425<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Settimi is an excellent statistician. She gives you the steps, which is important in statistical analysis. Shes a good professor, but is too concerned with keeping the MSPA program up to par, than helping her students when they need her. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2014<br>Class Name: 231<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a professor, she wasn't the most clear, but she was willing to help outside of the course and was motivational. Thankfully, she wasn't the easiest grader and would guide but not completely walk you through assignments, which is counter-intuitive in regards to anything technical and learned via process.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2014<br>Class Name: CSC424<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: WD</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible horrible horrible professor. Homeworks were spaced out every 2 weeks. Most of the students did not understand, I got feedback from the other students they all said her emails were not helpful, if you told her you're struggling, she'll say she's worried but not do much about it. Final project she only has 2 people working on a team.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2013<br>Class Name: IT403<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is very hard for all backgrounds excluding advanced Statistics . The prof. is not helpful and will drive you crazy with the assignment. Don't get behind, study hard and work on all home-works.  I used to love Statistics before, but she made me hate it after this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: CSC425<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She will NEVER reply your mail!!!!!She always makes mistakes in class!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2012<br>Class Name: IT231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice and pretty helpful. Some concepts in this class can be hard to follow, but if you make sure that you attend classes and ask questions whenever you need any bit of help, she'll do her best and do what she can to make you understand the material. Sometimes a bit tough on grading, but it's still pretty fair. Would take her again :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very dedicated teacher...engages with students constantly.
