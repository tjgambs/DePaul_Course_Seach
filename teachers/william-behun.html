    Love him! He is so interesting and helpful! you writea big essay but he's really open to whatever you want to write about, and he is lenient with extensions. No midterm or final, but one page papers due every week about class discussions. The Discussions are so interesting that they are super easy to write about.

    If you do all the written work you will get an A.  You really don't need to read because he explains everything in class that was supposed to be read for that class.

    WAB was great, I loved his energy in class.  His lectures were interesting and he made you feel comfotable participating.  The class was fairly easy, reading material was a little difficult but his lectures usually clarify concepts. Take this professor, I can't recommend him enough!  oh yeah, he does pace back and forth a little too much!

    Behun was a great teacher. His class was very thought provoking. He may be arrogant like one person said, but I think he has a right to be because he knows Greek and German and has a book getting published. He is also very available for help outside of class and will proofread rough drafts which is awesome.

    What can I say that hasn't already been said.  Not a difficult class, but WOW did I really learn a lot!  Totally made me think about the role of God and freewill in a really cool way...i dunno, I can't explain it, it was just a really great class.  I feel 'enlightened' :D

    Not bad, but not ground-shaking either. He's very nice, but can be boring at times. Weekly thought memos, and two papers (5&amp;9pgs each). He reads this site, so I guess comments here are at least a bit influenced by this

    Behun is a really good teacher.  He is knowledgeable and loves his job.  Weekly thought memos are easy 1 page papers.  Other than that there is a repsonse paper (4-6) pages on a reading of your choice.  And a final paper.  His lectures are not boring at all.  He likes beer too.

    Prof. Behun is such a fun guy! He relates everything to modern day stuff so you can understand it. There isn't a lot of class work just a weekly &quot;Thought Memo&quot; in addition to 1 Response Paper and the Final paper. I can't wait to take another class of his....definitely take him!!!!

    Prof. Behun is probably my favorite teacher at DePaul.  I have taken him twice and he makes his classes fun and interesting.  As long as you go to class (he definately takes attendance) and do your thought memos you are sure to at least get a B.  I would strongly recomend that you take his classes.  He is an asset to the school.

    Behun will def intimidate you at first with his bald head and accent but after a couple classes he is sure to become one of your favorite teachers at DePaul. PHL 100's content is difficult but Behun makes it easy understandable with his crazy stories and discussions. He knows what he is talking about and if you get him as a teacher you are lucky!

    This man will intimidate you the first day of class, but after that, he is probably one of the best professors at DePaul.  He is confusing, but then so is philosophy.  He will make you think, and work hard to explain everything.  I've always hated philosophy, but he challanged me to think, and to work in the class,and it paid off in the end. Thanks

    This guy is awesome. Makes you think about topics you normally wouldnt care for. Readings are not too bad, and his discussions are interesting. Doesnt bore you to death, but makes you think about cool stuff. Papers due every week, and 1 paper 4-6 pages and final paper 10-12 pages. Also he reads this site! What a down to earth guy!

Most importantly he explains it clearly and in an interesting way that keeps your attention. He is also willing to help outside of class.

    Prof Behun is awesome. He teaches you alot if you pay attention and attend class. If not, all you really need to know are 2 philosophers for the midterm and final paper. He knows EVERYTHING! especially all languages including german and greek. i live by this website and i say : TAKE HIM FOR SURE!!

    AMAZING professor.  He is passionate about the subject and makes the topics understandable and interesting.  Mixes anecdotal examples in, often to humorous effect.  He inspires a great sense of passion for philosophical inquiry.  Again, an amazing professor and I hope to take more classes with him.

    This professor is very good and very interesting in his classes.  His lectures are sometimes very interesting but he does talk a lot and it could be shortened but it's not that bad.  The papers are very easy and very light.  He doesn't have much work to be done in his class and grades are very easy to obtain. He is very organized.

    Behun is the**** he is one of my favorite teachers. He is an incredible orator because he manages to talk for the entire class and still keeps everyones attention. His work load is manageable and he is extremely funny. I would advise taking as many classes as possible with him. He is a professor that I could see myself getting **** with.

    I've taken Mr. Behun twice now, for ISP and Phi 101, and he is one of the best teachers I've ever had.  Extremely smart and really funny -- I would definitely recommend taking him.  He respects his students and really cares about your grade.  Lectures are very interesting.

    i absolutely loved prof. behun. i thought he made the class very easy to gain interest in and thought the class was great. key to enjoying the class more is to jump in and start discussions. cut him off and dont let him talk the whole class without anyone else saying a word the whole class. i recommend him. and he is totally hot ;)

    Awesome, interesting, smart... but I went to every class and worked 15+ hours researching and writing my paper and got a B. A fellow classmate of mine went only to 2/3 of the classes and then spent an hour making adjustmest to a pre-existing paper from a friend and got the same grade! What the hell&#63;

    Interesting and insightful course on business and ethics for a non-business/economic individual like myself. Some of the material was pretty complex at times, but Dr.Behun's incessant ramblings (lol) helped me to understand the material even more.Welldone

    Very good professor. His class is really easy. He's not a hard grader and he knows what he is talking about all the time. He can be funny too once in a while. I would take him again...he's one of the better professors at DP.

    Behun was alright except that he loves to hear himself speak. The class is 25% participation and he doesn't give anyone a chance to talk and he still gives you a low participation grade. Also,the class is boring. Other then that its cool.

    Dr. Behun is a very intelligent man. His classes become boring at times, but his enthusiasm and side comments helps balance that. I just wish his class would consist of more than just two papers!

    he tries his best to make the concept interesting, but with philosophy that's pretty much impossible.  he talks for the whole period, no class discussions whatsoever :( 3 papers during the whole course.  not bad, but not all that great either

    I fell in love with his bald head. If you talk in his class, and do the readings, you should do well, but he can be a bit officious, and insult you, but he's a great guy to have heated arguments with about the relativistic nature of morality.

    Pretty easy class.  25% is attendance and then you have 3 papers.  There is no midterm and no final.  One of the papers is an in class essay. He is not a hard grader, just try and be creative with how you write your papers and you should get at least a B.

    Easy class, just make him think you're interested and have him proof read your papers so he can correct them before grading. If you do that u should get at least an A-
