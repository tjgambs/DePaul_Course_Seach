A lot of reading but most of it is super interesting, even if you're not a poli sci major. If the class isn't happy with the readings she is happy to change them. Always willing to meet with students. Allows rewrites of most papers. Really enthusiastic about what she's teaching. She really wants to get to know her students. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She uses a lot of powerpoints, but it was never boring.
