    Dr. Weiss is FABULOUS!  She's got a sharp mind and a keen delivery.  Yes, she does talk 90 miles a minute, but she REALLY knows her stuff and will repeat.  Take her class.  You'll learn alot!

    By far, the worst course and professor I have EVER taken within my three years at DePaul.  Subject matter was way too complex and forget even attempting to assert your opinion because it is always wrong.  She has ALL the answers!

    Shes very good, clear, and a fair grader. Speaks quickly, but is willing to explain anything that is unclear to you.
