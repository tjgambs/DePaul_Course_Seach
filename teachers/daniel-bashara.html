Attendance matters and there are pop quizzes throughout the quarter, which means you have to keep up with the long readings. Easy grader when it comes to the papers, but tough on the midterm and final. I recommend taking this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2015<br>Class Name: MCS353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>The topic of this class was on Hollywood Cartoons and he mentioned that this is what he wrote his dissertation on so he was totally interested and it made the class so much more enjoyable. He is awesome and I would recommend taking literally any class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2015<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really awesome and interested in the topics himself so he is really engaged and it's so easy to participate in discussions. There is a lot to read but everything is interesting and useful and it was definitely one of the better classes I've taken here at DePaul. In my opinion he is the best Communications Professor at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>From looking at the reviews on here I thought this class would be great, but not at all. His lectures are SO confusing, the reading we have to do are so not necessary and they're extremely long. There is 2 papers and 3 reading responses and he's a hard grader. Also the midterm & final very HARD. You have to write an essay for both. He's nice though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2014<br>Class Name: MCS353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dan Bashara is what most professors should aspire to be. Helpful, engaging, always willing to change his lecture questions to better suit the personality of a class. Not only are his topics well researched, but you can feel his enthusiasm for the topic in everything he does. Take him and your life will be changed - he's practically my idol!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2014<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class, very passionate about the topics and makes it interesting. Uses up to date topics and media clips. Tough grader. You need to be VERY thorough for the midterm, but he makes the material bearable. Go to class, pay attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2014<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Daniel Bashara inspired me to go to grad school. Not only is he the sweetest, but his class topics are so fun, you'll feel TERRIBLE missing class at all. Papers are fun and thoughtful - be sure to study the  theorists! Hands down one of the finest instructors I've ever had. Love you, Dan!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2014<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dan was absolutely incredible. He is extremely passionate about what he teaches and really knows what he is talking about. He encourages participation and believes anything anyone says is valid. His class is super laid back and he shows lots of fun media clips. The reading can be tough but he makes it really clear in class. Definitely recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2014<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>The best teacher I have ever had!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2013<br>Class Name: MCS271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Bashara was one of the best teachers I have ever had. Not only was he clear, concise and overall extremely helpful, he taught me so many things that went beyond the classroom. Everyone in class loved it- we all were sad to see it end!</div></div></div></body></html>
