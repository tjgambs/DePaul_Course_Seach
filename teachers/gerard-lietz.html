In a way, he's a stereotypical science geek.  His lectures are usually interesting, although at times, he got sidetracked into philosophical aspects.  He made jokes at times, which kept the class fun, even with a dry topic like physics.  My only gripe was the textbook.  It was really bad, although even Lietz himself agreed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2007<br>Class Name: PHY206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>People are being too harsh. Prof. Lietz is an endearing old man who makes charming old man jokes. His class is boring, of course...but it's physics for non-majors! He is very nice and willing to answer questions. The homework is super easy, as are the labs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: PSY223<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In my last semester of school, and unfortuanlty this class will damage my GPA.  I consider myself a good student with above 3.0 gpa.  This may be my second C in my entire student career.  Very nice funny man with good intentions though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: PHY206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible teacher, funny guy but doesnt spend time on the formulas so then you are screwed over for the quizes. I had been warned against taking the class after signing up for it but I am a person who likes to make my own opinions but I should have listened to all of those people because my GPA is going to suffer because of this class and teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2006<br>Class Name: PHY206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny guy, but incredibly obscure in the way he teaches.  Whenever I asked for help, he never gave me a clear answer.  He is NOT to old to be teaching though.  I don't know why people say things, like that.  It's not as if he is having strokes mid-lecture or anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2004<br>Class Name: PHY110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was hard to people who are not good at math. He sometimes goes to fast in his lectures and expects you to do the university standard of 6 hours of homework a week to &quot;flesh-out&quot; what was said in the lecture. I got a b in the class because of a easy final.Class is for math people mainly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2004<br>Class Name: PHY223<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THE CLASS! IT IS TIME FOR HIM TO RETIRE! THE QUIZZES AND TEST HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CLASSWORK OR HOMEWORK. HE GRADES HARD AND TAKES OFF FOR LITTLE THINGS! EXPECTS YOU TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT PHYSICS, AND DOESN'T WANT TO HELP YOU WHEN YOU ASK HIM TO! DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2004<br>Class Name: PHY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>too old to be teaching. some labs seem to have nothing to do with topice, TAs never knew what was going on. talks a bit too much about his family- some funny stories, but mostly too much info on that topic</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: PHY223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>such a nice old man! very passionate about his subject, but made it easy for non-physics majors to understand. i loved going to lab for his class! he's accessible even though there are TAs teaching, and his tests are reasonable.</div></div></div></body></html>
