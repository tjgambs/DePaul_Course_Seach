But she is very nice, and she forces discusions of different issues from many different angles that don't often otherwise get attention.  Overall, good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i took her for my soph multi course and i thought it was entirly to hard from what i hear from the other multi courses, if you want to learn a lot take her class but be prepared to work for your grade lots of reading and papers. If you just want the credit and an easy A i dont recomend taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200DEM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unclear about expectations in class.  Even the sylabus is disorganized.  Takes absences very personally.  Lots of work for a LA&S requirement.  She is a PHD in poly sci and teaches class that way.    She takes her time giving you back your grade though.  Lectures are boring!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for my Harold Washington focal point class. She is the worst teacher! Do not take her. She gives about 500 pages of reading every week. She makes you write jounrals and ridiculous papers. She does not return e-mails. yes she has a doctorate in what she does, but that doesn't make her good!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: PSC325LATINO<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If theory is something you're looking for, take this class.  You're not going to get a lot of cold hard facts, but more open ended questions and examinations of current Latino politcs.  She is helpful and very nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2004<br>Class Name: PSC311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed her class.

Class was extremely interesting but at many times, difficut to comprehend some topics. LOTS of reading! One exam and it was HARD. Final project was extensive but creative. Don't come to class late. Nice professor overall.</div></div></div></body></html>
