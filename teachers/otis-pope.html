Reads off powerpoints he didn't even make (gets them off Pearson myHistory Lab) for lectures, gives unclear assignments, and doesn't seem knowledgable at all about history. He cant even identify all 50 states on a map!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2013<br>Class Name: HST182HST183<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is absolutely horrible! everything he says in class can be read in the power points online, and I suggest you stick to them because he gives incorrect information all of the time.  He is not interested in hearing other opinions, and when you prove to know more than he does, he automatically shuts you down.  DON'T THAKE THIS PROFESSOR</div></div></div></body></html>
