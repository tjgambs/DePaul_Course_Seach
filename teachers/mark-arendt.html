I think what makes him exceptional as a professor is how he doesn't automatically negate what students say as incorrect, but rather encourages opinions and thoughts. Work is straightforward, easy. Readings are what you'd expect in English. Overall, I think he was great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2012<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class in the Spring Quarter of 2012.
