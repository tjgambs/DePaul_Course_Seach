His class dealing with philosopher's notions on time was incredibly interesting, although difficult. He is more than willing to help and never makes you feel dumb for not understanding. I had little interest in the subject before this class and i genuinely felt as if i gained something. I would recommend this teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy!  He's extremely intelligent, which sometimes makes what he's lecturing about hard to understand but he always makes himself available to help you understand the topic.  Light reading, volunteer to go in the first couple weeks for the group project because there is less information to cover.  Overall, pretty easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pardikes is really nice, extremely knowledgeable, and has some great suits. He doesn't make you buy a book. No reading is longer than 10 pages and he really simplifies the material to your advantage. You must participate either in class or on the discussion board. Overall a great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No textbook, material is available on D2L. 2 reading assignments every week. 1st half of quarter only thing we do is read & go to class for lecture. Group presentation either before midterm or after. Midterm was 20 short answer questions, only graded 16 w/ one extra credit. Watched 2 movies, and had a final project to be turned in via D2L.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a great class. Jeff is a great teacher, he is extremely knowledgeable and willing to help students. If you have trouble in his class visit him in office hours, he is happy to clarify any confusion. He is a little slow at answering emails, however, which is a bit annoying. He is also pretty easy on the eyes, and dresses quite dapp</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I hated the class, I did not understand anything. He explained our readings perfectly and even saw me after class for a meeting which he explained everything. He offers extra credit, but grades papers kinda hard. I still liked him and he really inspired me to think in a philosophical way now. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not easy but c'mon we are no longer in high school. 2 notes, 3 papers, 12am  e-deadline, 1 rewrite, 2 (tough) extra credits. Visit his office before papers, better outline guaranteed. Tough but I learned a lot! And did I mention he's HOT&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Pardikes- Good Guy. Friendly, nice, personable. He's goofy, nerdy but prob gets some ladies. Decent class, but he's cryptic, speaks very academically sometimes or like Plato/Aristotle might. Required to read a lot, Notes portfolio due twice. 3 papers 3-4 pgs 1 book-$11</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2011<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take Business Ethics with this prof!

He is an extremely difficult grader and randomly gave me a horrible participation grade even though i attended every class and raised my hand frequently. Do not take him if you are looking for an easy GenEd, it will not turn out that way</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is very helpful, but one of the more difficult to Understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very very nice. His approach takes some getting used to, especially as a philosophy teacher. Meaning, he isn't like others and will never talk down to you. He is very smart and vast in what he teaches. Wonderful to talk to, so approachable and understanding, and very open to listening. Genuinely well versed in his study and very good person</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE. Assigned a ton of reading that didn't correlate to the assignments.  Canceled class an hour before it started.  Tends to ramble. Had to edit the schedule four times.  Only good thing was the multiple curves, but you'll still have to work hard in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor for an intro course.  Also, he never posted assignment prompts when he said that he will, he never responded to e-mails, he cancelled class twice, he was very unclear in what he wanted from the students, and he lost half the class' midterms! I still did well, but way too much work and requirements for an intro to PHL course...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this class because usually the material was hard to comprehend but interesting. Sometimes the lectures got boring but his sheer good looks were able to keep me awake. Really nice teacher, sometimes a little disorganized but nothing terrible. Take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2008<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was very informative. He knows what he's talking about, and in class he'll answer any questions. However, HE HASN'T RESPONDED TO A SINGLE EMAIL OF MINE! and he has extremely limited office hours. He grades VERY hard. Assignments weren't posted on BlackBoard on time which makes his class even harder! Very time consuming and confusing!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2008<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>never kept his word, always said &quot;the grades are on blackboard&quot; but guess what they were never there.  ever since he attained the invent which he canceled two classes, he was not organized.  he never put the assignment on time on blackboard, for eg. today is Friday and we don't have the assignment on which is due on Tuesday. two of them.hard grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2008<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not an easy teacher for a class like PHI.he was out of town for about 8-9 days and missed two classes.and the midterm was due in that period and we had no help.  He said many things which he never did.Never replied to any of emails.n he is hard grader.You can take him to get at/least B if you do his hw and how much you try the hw is tough.n g</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2008<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice teacher who is clearly passionate about teaching. Understanding philosophy is hard but he is dedicated to teaching it clearly. It's not an easy A, but it is possible as long as you put effort into absorbing what he's teaching you.

Really nice and takes the time to answer any and all questions. One big paper at the end (7-8 pages), but has great availability and is willing to meet as often as necessary.
