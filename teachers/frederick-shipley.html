I do not understand why the FIN at this school on average are horrible...but he is by far the worse. I am so frustrated right now.

He only made it to 2 classes after the midterm, and we didn't learn anything.  Quite possibly the worst teacher at the entire university.  If you want to learn anything take someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2005<br>Class Name: FIN335<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never get anything back. Only indication of your grade is when it's posted on campusconnect.  Be prepared to play solitaire, repeat pointless topics, etc. in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: FIN335<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Real easy finance elective. Like 4 multiple choice quizzes every other Monday. Midterm is also multiple choice. And final is take home. Plus teacher will ditch class more than you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An embarassement to DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2005<br>Class Name: FIN335<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not much to say about him. Just an easy elective, and plus no Midterm.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man takes NO interest in teaching, yet he is a professor.  As mentioned, he cancelled class many times and was late to EVERY class.  Impossible to get ahold of him- still trying to contest the grade I received.  You don't get a breakdown of your grade, it's just submitted. Not reccomended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330335<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i liked him. He let you know what was on the final by what was on the quizzes!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2004<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I will admit that the class was easy, but how much are you will to take. He never responds to emails or phone calls. He is so hard to reach. Out of 10 week (night class) he canceled 4 classes, let us out early 3-4 times. I kind of feel sorry for the poor guy, since he is very sickly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was pretty easy, but the professor never responds to emails and never grades assignments.  I only found out how I was doing when my grade was posted on CampusConnection (A-) at the end of quarter.  He cancelled class 3 times out of 10 which was good.  Class was incredibly boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2004<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WOW THIS WAS ONE OF THE EASIEST CLASSES I HAVE EVER TAKEN IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE, AND I REALLY DO MEAN THE EEEEAAASSSIIIEEESSSTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OK, the guy is super nice and will give extensions. But the class is utterly pointless. I'm halfway through the quarter,and I still don't know what the class is about. You won't get a bad grade,but ICS's can be interesting and fun.If you can avoid, do so.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2004<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Useless lecture for such a useless class..He rambles on about anything.. students fall aslees in front of him.. nice guy but horrible teacher and class is irrelevant to everything.. DePaul loses credibility for a class like this..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2004<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shipley is one of the easiest teachers at depaul.  Study his notes and quizes, and your almost garunteed to get an A or B.  Remember you have to study the notes and quizes in order to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2004<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely unorganized, you have no idea what your grade is or how you're doing until the class is over and you receive your final grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2004<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does not know how to Teach.  He stands there lecturing about gods knows what while everyone else is sleeping.  Spend your $1,000+ else were.. you wont learn anything nor will it be easy.. DONT TAKE HIM</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2004<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OK AVOID him..he never gives anything back,u have no idea how ur doimng in the class, I thought I knew my stuff and then my final grade turned out to be a C. I have str8 A's, so it's not like im a slacker. His exams are tough, his class has no structure</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He never turns anything back. I went to him for my midterm on the day of the final and he still didn't have it graded. He is not with it at all. He misses classes like its his job, forgets to give tests on test day and you never know your standing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2004<br>Class Name: FIN335<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher when he shows up, but that doesn't happen very often.  He forgets assignments, takes months to correct quizes, is late to every class and never ever responds to emails.  My tuition went to waste because I learned almost nothing.</div></div></div></body></html>
