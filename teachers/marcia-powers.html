This class is completely unstructured.  She does not follow the syllabus at all.  Class consists of several projects for which many people take way too much time to present, though she doesn't police any of this.  Multiple choice & true/false quiz is a joke, and an open book, take-home final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2008<br>Class Name: MGT330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher.
