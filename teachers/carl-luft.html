Take detailed notes. Typical PhD academic with valuable real world examples.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: FIN363<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Luft is a good professor. Gives you lots of hints as to what could be on his exams. No MC though, all handwritten so take it seriously.  Just study the things he covers in class and you'll be fine.  He teaches you exactly what you need to know for the exams.  Funny too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2012<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So I have taken this class with both Etherington and Luft and I have to tell you that its day and night! Luft is so much more helpful and he is very clear on what is on the tests! Do not take this class with Etherington or you will more than likely drop or fail, like half my class! Luft is so  much BETTER! And Luft curves and Etherington will NOT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2010<br>Class Name: FIN333H<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Luft is a great guy. His teaching style is a little sloppy and he bounces around a lot. Grade is based on a 30min group project and his final. Get started on the project asap - do not procrastinate. Final is based on reformulating statements which he focuses on all quarter. Very interesting and useful topic. Overall not too hard. Good class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: FIN363<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Derivatives is no joke. 45% midterm, 50% final, 5% participation. He prefers to explain the material his own way so textbook is pretty much useless. Must take good notes in class or you'll be lost. Pay attention very well and take lots and lots of notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2010<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Luft is by far the best professor I have ever had.  He gives great career advice and supports the well-being of his students.  If you want to know the foundations of finance you need to take Professor Luft.  He teaches 330 in the summer usually ---avoid taking Fischer at all cost.  Fischer failed half of his class--crushes everyone's GPA</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2010<br>Class Name: FIN617<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely the worst professor in the WORLD!  This is my 2nd masters degree so needless to say I have had a lot of professors.  I have never wrote a negative comment before on this site, but this guy deserves it.  Disjointed, unintelligent, useless teaching style.  Oh yeah and he is arrogant, but without merit. DONT TAKE!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2010<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Luft is so fun and has given me great insight into the finance world.  Exam 1 (15% weight), Exam 2 (30%), Exam 3 (50%), and participation (5%-which everyone get unless you use your cell phone in class).  I recommend that every finance major take a class with Professor Luft; he is a down-to-earth guy and tests you on material discussed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2009<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please stay away if you can.

This class should not be offered during summer sessions as material is not easy and takes a lot of time to understand as professor is not very helpful in understand material, he often not sure himself how to deal with this problmes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2009<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Have to agree with the previous comment, class was a total waste of money and what is the most important - time. This class should not be offered for summer session.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: FIN562<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not an easy class. Midterm and final consist of essay questions and problems. One group project is 15% of grade. Some of the essay questions are not from class notes or the book. So, you are on your own. Exams are open books/notes. Lots of hands out. Read the book and go over the in-class problems.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2008<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He might know his stuff but he has no idea how to teach it.

I took this class summer w/ 4 other classes while working full-time in a finance industry & it helped me a great deal. I like the guy, he is nice & straight forward. If you take notes and go over his examples and memorize some of the vocabulary, you should be fine.

Nice guy, smart guy, but clearly no structure to the class and he obviously does not prepare ahead of time. I read the negative comments before taking this class but I still took the class. BIGGEST MISTAKE of my post grad years! Just don't take it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: FIN562<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One word sums it all up...GARBAGE, do not waste your tuition dollars on this class. Makes an already hard subject even harder. He spends half the time trying to figure things out himself, very obvious he doesn't prepare to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: FIN333H<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unclear, gives no specific directives for any projects or final. I feel like I learned nothing but how to manipulate Excel formulas. Much nicer than his exaggerated reputation amongst students suggests. Has very interesting stories and some good advice.

In-class and out of class work does not pertain to ANYTHING he covers on exams. Admittedly, he is &quot;nicer&quot; than everyone says he is, but this doesn't makeup for a poorly taught and structured class.

He is very smart but I feel like I learned nothing this quarter. Group projects were ridiculous and should not be used in a financial statement analysis class. People need to master this individually.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Luft is a tool, period. He does not communicate the material well, his &quot;real world&quot; examples do not pertain to class material, and frankly I could learn more in 3 hours if I were at home sleeping. HE'S NOT HARD!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an id1ot.

Really does his job well in getting across exactly what needs to be taught.  Doesn't waste students time with needless details from the book.  Make sure you pay attention in class and participate so you can keep up with discussions or you may fall behind.  He is VERY willing to spend as much time as needed to help you understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2005<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely tough class, but it wasn't that bad.

You have to put a lot of time into the class. DO the homework, reading the book doesn't help much with his teaching style. He gets his point accross, but he could be nicer. &quot;don't pull Dr. Luft's chain&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: FIN362HONORS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Risk Management. Good professor, but he loses temper easily, so be careful. &quot;Don't pull Dr. Luft's chain&quot;-his own words. He's pretty tough, but he will teach you a lot, if you actively cooperate. Take him if you're up for it, but don't expect an easy ride.

Finance Honors Program is worth it just to take him for Risk Management. It's great taking a class that you know no one else at DePaul is taking, and knowing things that no one else at DePaul has a clue about.
