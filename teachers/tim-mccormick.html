Tim is a great professor but one of the toughest graders. It's nice that his current occupation ties in perfectly with the course and you will be sure to learn a lot from him. Writing papers was the toughest part of his class but as long as you reach out, Tim will be there to assist you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Prof McCormick is amazing!Class isnt easy we had 2 study questions (2 pg papers about current events), a ch review (4-6 page paper about 2 chs in book), a refl essay (8-10 page paper about an ethical issue), final exam (take home 5 essay questions). He truly cares about his students. Great classroom lectures and discussions! Woud def take again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2015<br>Class Name: CLASS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the greatest professors ever. He's a professional and has experience with what he teaches -- he works in the environment  that covers the course. Mr. McCormick is help and willing to assist you. However, do not make excuses for late assignments; he does not like cheesy excuses. I enjoyed so much, I wish he was my professor for others.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2014<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at DePaul.  There aren't too many assignments but if you feel yourself getting overwhelmed, he is there for students who reach out to him.  He genuinely cares for his students and makes them his number one priority.  Don't be afraid to talk to him! He may seem intimidating but he is such a nice guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2014<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the hardest classes I've taken at DePaul, simply because he is so unclear on what he is looking for. On one of my papers, he gave me an 18.3 out of 20. Where did the .3 come from?! He gives no guidelines on what he's expecting. He just gives a prompt, and doesn't tell you how he wants you to answer that prompt. Avoid him. He ruined my GPA:</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2014<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice man and he really cares about his students. However, assignments are due weekly and his grading is all over the place. Does not give a grading rubric or any ideas of how he grades. He grades them differently each time and for each person. Assignments are confusing because he doesnt give specific guidelines. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2014<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy. Lots of assignments that are due every week. Tough grader on the papers(all the assignments are papers). Must go to class if you want notes since he doesn't post any up online. Makes you participate. Overall, an okay class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2014<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I've had at DePaul thus far. He's truly a GENUINE dude and cares about the class. He takes what should be a very generic and boring class and makes it thought-provoking and intriguing class. I never thought I'd be EXCITED to go to night class. A must-take for all business majors or anyone looking for a religion credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor I have had at DePaul. He is incredibly kind and really wants students to succeed. He is really invested in the class and really tries to connect with everyone in the class. I gained a lot from the class and was happy to have him as my teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an incredibly knowledgeable and interesting teacher. I didn't like how every assignment was due in the last month though and week after week. He doesn't post his notes online because he wants you to go to class to take notes and learn. He only teaches night classes though but I would recommend if that is your only availability.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2012<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I never rate professors but I felt inclined to do so with professor McCormick. He knows how to get his students' attention and gets everyone involved. Which makes class interesting and actually makes us look forward to it. Best professor I have had at DePaul thus far.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2012<br>Class Name: THEO171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the SOCP 8-week theology class, and I was expecting the worst. This professor is extremely empathetic, engaging, and his lectures are interesting. He knows about the contradictions of Christianity and often uses those facets as discussion points or rebuttals to the more narrow-minded students of the class, despite being Christian. Recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly he should teach professors how to do their job. Best teacher I ever had, and sadly will probably be the best I ever will have. I've never learned so much, so easily. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2011<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tim is super nice,he's very helpful. the whole class is like a discussion class,2 reflection paper,1 super easy midterm,1 essay presentation(EASY),1 case study paper,and come to class to participate.EASY A!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2010<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took McCormick for business ethics. He is one of the nicest, caring, intelligent and insightful professors I have ever had. He is a successful CEO and I believe only teaches one class/one night/semester. He challenges you and definitely makes you think but is very helpful. Don't be intimidated by his syllabus, its not as bad as it seems.</div></div></div></body></html>
