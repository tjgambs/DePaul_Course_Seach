    SO helpful. I know my way around Adobe but he was nice enough to help others who weren't. Made classes easy and fun. Not much time required out of class which was great.

    Took his GD 105 class and he was a very good instructor! He is very informative and always willing to help out. He gave some interesting assignments didn't really enjoy the animation portion of the class but beside that it was fairly easy if you have knowledge of Illustrator. His quizzes were also not very hard as long as you read. Would recommend.

    Chris is a great instructor. He's knows what he's teaching and shows a genuine interest for it. I took his intro to visual design class. Though I found Illustrator/Flash frustrating to use at times, his guides and lectures help make it a lot easier. Would recommend!
