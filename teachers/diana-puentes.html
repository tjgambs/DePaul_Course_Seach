    A decent teacher, but pretty tough. Refuses to communicate in English (even in her low level classes) and tests are confusing even though she tells you the material you need to study

    I had her for SPN 106 and it was probably just the same difficulty as AP spanish in high school. Only thing was she was a tough grader, and her tests could be difficult. However she is a caring lady and will help you if you need it.

    Literally the worst professor I have ever had at DePaul. She is AWFUL. She clearly picks favorites and grades everything with extreme bias. Participation is  MUST &amp; if you don't participate she will call on you and purposely try to make you feel stupid. Absolutely terrible. So rudeunavailablebiasedunprofessional

    I loved Professor Puentes' class!  She made it really fun to learn Spanish.  She talks almost exclusively in Spanish which is really great if you're trying to be fluent.  Chapter tests every two weeks or so.  Very easy.  Homework isn't due until the test. Take this class! Professor is great and you will not regret it!!

    Sweet woman. I enjoy learning new languages, so it wasn't a problem that she spoke entirely in Spanish in class. A lot of people, however, had a tough time understanding her. She comes off as sarcastic, but she really does care about her students.

    She is so fun and treats you like an adult. Be prepared to talk in class and to be called on. She is very flexible and will give help outside of class if necessary.

    She is a very nice person and an average professor.  She speaks very fast and uses Spanish almost exclusively in class.  Tends to get sidetracked OFTEN and will go on tangents, but they're still related to Spanish.  If you read, do the homework, and study, its a pretty easy A.  Be prepared for limited discussion and explanations on book readings.

    She knows what she's talking about. Makes you try which is a good thing if you're actually trying to be fluent.

    Honestly the worst professor I have ever had. Completely unprepared for every class, and so RUDE! If you don't understand she looks at you like you are an  idiot. She was terrible, do not take this class. She never returns work you have no idea how you are doing throughout the quarter and her grading is confusing and inconsistent. She also goes off

    She's extremely awful. She chooses her favorites and makes it very obvious. SHe isnt prepared for class ever and rarely on time. She doesn't ever answer emails and you dont get any work back the entire quarter. Shhes kind of intimidating in her own way. However, she is really enthusiastic about spanish and bases the entire class on the reading or m

    As a person, she's great. However, as a professor, I could not take her seriously. Late about answering emails, accepting late homework assignments, and who answers their cell phone while teaching&#63;! Kind of felt like it was a waste of tuition. I will say though, EASY. If your looking to breeze through, this is the professor for you.

    Spanish is spoken at all times. The class isn't that hard but it is so boring! All the class is is discussion based and she does not do a good job of answering questions. This class made me lose interst in Spanish.

    she's really fun and enthusiastic! i found her difficult to understand...but that's probably because she was speaking a foreign language.
