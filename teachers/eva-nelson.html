Passes attendance sheet around in the beginning of each class and that counts for your participation. One essay, then the final. Easy class just don't disrespect it by not showing up cause then you won't pass. Really nice, clear with expectations and easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: MGT361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took as a night class, always got out early. Very easy midterm, just read over the notes packet provided. Group project that requires getting info on an organization, still pretty simple. You don't need the book, I'd say take it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2013<br>Class Name: MGT302<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice lady.
