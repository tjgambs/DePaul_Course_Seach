She was informative, thoughtful and helpful. I admit more structured is needed, BUT I think I did okay being this was my first on-line course. I really did respect her ability to keep the subject in line with reality--so needed in those courses!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2014<br>Class Name: MPS573<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I do not like how she structures her course. She made the course into a hybrid course. So every other week we didn't attend class but watched lectures online and did a discussion submission. This wasn't helpful in getting a complete understanding of the curriculum and being a class about communities it's hard to even get to know your classmates.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2014<br>Class Name: MPS587<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>She did not follow the standardized curriculum (specifically the literature review), which left me catching up in 587.  I feel as though I've had to cram two quarters worth of work into one. I ended up switching professors for 587.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: MPS542<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Dr. Holloway's Public Policy Analysis class. So far, it was the most challenging, yet intriguing class I've taken at DePaul. I learned so much. Dr. Holloway can be a bit hard to make contact with outside of class, so coming to class with questions and ready to learn is crucial. You get out of this class what you put in.</div></div></div></body></html>
