Very passionate. He's definitely someone that you want to know if you're looking to get into Television. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2014<br>Class Name: TV271<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>He's not the most efficient professor to be teaching this "intro" class, but he's respectful and will help you out if you really show interest in wanting to learn and pass this class. He grades on a criteria of the TV industry standards, but his feedback is insightful, though he could be more organized in returning feedbackgrades faster.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2014<br>Class Name: TV271<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: D</div><div id="right"><div>If you aren't a Digital Cinema major or if you have never taken any production classes before you will fail this class. He only pays attention to the students who know what they are doing and will not help other students. I would not recommend this teacher to anyone. He does minimal teaching and gives no help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: TV271401<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible. Absolutely horrible. One time he showed us a number of examples of a project we were assigned and told us various grades, none above a b. The example of an A was a scene from Lost. That's how this class works. Steer clear. Posts grades late. Unclear and sly. Doesn't understand what "introduction" means.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2013<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst professor ever had. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!smiling all the time but gives you an F... Too much work for full time students unless you only have one class this quarter. No grade on each project but gives you a final grade...What else can I say. DO NOT TAKE!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2013<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is one of the worst at DePaul University. He assigned 3 projects, which could not be worked on in class. The final project took over 32hrs to complete! He addmited that the class was too hard! Grades very tough.DONT TAKE ...you will regret it!</div></div></div></body></html>
