After that there isn't much left to learn about pirates unless you're going to be a pirate historian. He would give group projects and then on the day they are due not cover them. I wouldn't take him again, and don't recoomend takin him once</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for a focal point, and he is the most irritating prof. ever! He is unclear about what he wants and when he wants things, gives us a huge assignment two days before they're due,and never follows through with what he says he's gonna do. It might as well be an online course, cause everything is done outside of class. stay away from this man!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2006<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got an A. I got a 70 on the midterm which was like a B+, optional final. Our group screwed up big time, but no probs. Seemed tough because of the insane project but can't complain because i really dont think i had an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had to take this class to graduate and it nearly kept me from graduating.  The midterm was sooo hard the class average was like 70 percent after a curve.  Studying doesn't even help you for the test. do not take this class. There is soo much work for this class.  My hardest class ever at DePaul it will ruin your GPA</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2006<br>Class Name: ANT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very irritating. He's not clear on what he wants, he's not all that interesting, and while he does pick some good books to read, he fails to make them the least bit interesting discussion-wise. I'd recommend not to take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2006<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this in hopes of having little homework so i could concentrate on harder classes in my major. Turns out this guy likes to give 9 hours of homework per week in a freshmen level course. Take him if you truely want to learn archaeology but not if you are just looking for an easy blow off class to fulfill a science lab requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2006<br>Class Name: ANT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't even read his name cause you do not want to be in his class. He doesn't utilize the class time efficently or effectively. He ask too much from the students and does not realize that we as college students have other classes, personal life, work, and other projects to do. There a lot of reading for each class, group projects and insane paper!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take his class. He is not helpful, clear, or nice. The scattered assignments and unclear guidelines made this class not only boring, but harder than it should have been.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He may come off as an ****, but overall he is a good teacher.  He doesn't believe in concrete answers, but rather analysis.  His discussions is really great and he is very helpful outside of the classroom.  The grading is somewhat unclear, but he is very direct with whats he expects of us. He may be hard, but he is the real deal.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most unclear prof I've had yet.  His lectures were all over the place.  The daily assignments are easy, but he gives you almost no guidelines for the papers.  He's not as arrogant as other people have said, but he is somewhat full of himself at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is very arrogant...and really puts students self esteem down! I dont thing that is his intention but he definitly needs to work on his people skills and his teaching skills...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2005<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are incrediible boring and unclear. The assignments for the class are a small essay based on the readings do every class session and 3 observation assignments and a critical analysis. If you go to his office he is really helpful on getting you started on your 4 major papers and the every day papers are fairly easy if you read. However i wouldnt take this class again if i had the choice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2005<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are incrediible boring and unclear.

Seriously, this was the easiest class I have ever taken.  Simple exams and assignments.  I am an anthropology major and this was by far the easiest anthro class I have ever taken.  Maybe it's harder than most 100 level courses but really if you are an anthro major you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2005<br>Class Name: ANT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the class was okay. he's kind of a jerk.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you get a chance to take the Pirates class, do it.  Mostly classtime consisted of watching pirate movies, discussion, and joking around.  Hauser has a lot of interest in the subject and makes it a lot of fun.  Just do the reading and shut up when people are talking and it'll be one of the funnest classes you'll take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2005<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not let the other ratings fool you.  Dr. Hauser makes a ANT 120 fun, he is willing to help you, and the labs are not that hard.  I would recommend this class to anyone who is NOT LAZY like of the other raters.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2005<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't be a lazy whiny slacker and his class will be fine.

He expects you to know everything he is saying and to read his mind when he calls on you in class. Besides that, he's really arrogant. DONT TAKE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows what he is talking about, just doesn't know how to explain it.

It's week 8 and we still haven't gotten our assignments back. I have no idea what is expected of me, and I doubt he even knows what he wants.

He's not very organized BUT he is very nice, tries to make class interesting, available outside of class and will speak with you afterwards--not flexiblwith due dates and if you are bad with daily assignments steer clear.  Other than that I recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2004<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you've taken an archaeology course before, you're set.
