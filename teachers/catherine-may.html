She will punish you very harshly grade-wise if you do not agree with her conspiracy theory that the IMF bank controls the world and that groups like Al QaedaHamas are simply freedom fighters fighting against IMF-imperialism.

My work was graded harder in this class that the 2 300 level courses I was taking this quarter. Quizzes were worded really tricky and specific, and writing was graded like it was graduate school. A brilliant woman, no doubt, but she shouldn't teach entry level</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. May is the BEST if you are trying to get a feel for PSC or just taking it for a requirement.

But if you don't participate in EVERY class you will get a B. So if you are the type of student that will not participate. Don't take her. Her reading assignments are long and and boring. 20+ pages due every between every class. Would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: PSC236<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice person and some lectures can be intense. She has no problem giving hundreds of pages per class. Essentially only midterm and final, and they are irrelevant to the lectures, entirely reading based.

Yeah, she knows her stuff and she is no doubt a very intelligent woman but she is so biased that it is disgusting. I am a liberal and she made me want to vote Republican.

She is passionate about what she teaches and cares about the well being of each of her students. She is very entertaining in class, so if you come you will learn.

She is the reason we foot the bill for exorbitant tuition here - unparalleled quality. If you're complicit with reading and participating, you WILL excel in this course. ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL PROFESSOR. I look forward to this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2011<br>Class Name: PSC236<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love prof May and would definitely recommend her to anyone in polisci.

I;ve had Prof. May and she is extremely fair and does not &quot;hate&quot; anyone for opposing viewpoints. In fact, that's why her classes are so lively because all views are welcome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2010<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's into what she teaches and it shows. Although engaging, she's a bit intimidating and likes to talk. In order to get a good grade, you HAVE to read and participate and excel at the papers and midterm/final. She's okay. A good person to teach but not the best grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/16/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An awesome teacher.

She tries to get her students to be engaged in the course.  Helps you with anything including giving you guidance on your papers.  If you take good notes, and you skim through the book, it's not hard to get an A or high B.  He screaming, jumping, and yelling are all a way for the students to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cathy May is such a great professor.

Very knowledgeable and wants you to learn.  Class itself had it's small challenges, but nothing you can't handle.  Quizzes somewhat difficult but Mid-Term final easier.  Papers are short, somewhere between 5 and 10 pages.  Very loud, but well worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2009<br>Class Name: PSC319<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor May is an awesome professor.
