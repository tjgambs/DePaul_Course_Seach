Don't be fooled by the non-counting Midterm, the final is much harder and much more serious than you would assume after half of the course.

He actually teaches you as opposed to just reading off a power point. Attendance is a must, seeing as how his test is 100% on material covered in class. Your entire grade depends on your final. It sounds daunting but its fairly easy if you take detailed notes and study them before every class. Great tax course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2011<br>Class Name: ACC566<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2011<br>Class Name: ACC566<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Make tax interesting!</div></div></div></body></html>
