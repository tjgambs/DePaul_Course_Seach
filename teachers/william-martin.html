Organization of assignments in class and on the syllabus could have been better, but no two assignments were the same and that kept things interesting.  An easy class, for the most part.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perfect Professor to teach a Human Resource Class. He is very patient and the tasks he lets his student do is creative and relevant to real world. A very class person. I was pleased that I got to take a class with him as the professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2010<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's great and extremely helpful. Strongly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor. His classes are interesting and easy to get through. Gives many interesting life lessons. Some of the assignments were a bit confusing in the beginning though, but he clarified it via email on timely basis. I would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BLAH! he's nice and all, but seriously&#63; this class is total waste of time and money.  no need to attend class, notes are unnecessary. the only thing u use the book for is the final, 30% of grade. loves having pointless speakers and over-using metaphors.  loves people who can bs their way through any answer. didnt learn a thing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2009<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His classes are completely pointless to attend. He never actually says anything of value. All his lectures are BS disguised as something important. Assigns guest speakers and &quot;group meeting days&quot; for 1/3 of the classes and doesn't even show up. If you want to be preached to about life lessons, take him. If you want to learn, take someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sounds like he rated well on here for classroom.  Wish I would had him in class, but had him online so did not get to experience all the things mentioned by others.  He was good prof, but communication was lacking due to online format and it wasn't always clear what the assignments and expectations were.  Gook prof though, very fair, good class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2009<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Martin is fantastic.  I have learned so much in just 10 weeks.  He has you apply concepts to your job which really makes things hit home.  He has a lot of experience and knowledge that everyone can learn from.  Class time flew by because the topics were so interesting. I would recommend him to others and would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Martin is one of the best professors I've had at DePaul! He is extremely smart and always makes the material relevant and interesting.  He is an easy grader, and we always got out of class early.  Great guy to take MGT 300 with!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2008<br>Class Name: MGT526<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful and funny professor.
