His expectations of your knowledge for the midterm and final seems almost unreasonable. You MUST study for exams - without question. Also, be prepared for a consistent dose of cheesy humor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2014<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm and final were impossible. Matching,fill in the blank with no word bank, definitions, labeling diagrams etc. Would never, ever take again. Tough grader. Powerpoints are confusing because he doesn't put everything there is to know about a subject, the info is all over the place so you have to search for it to piece it all together.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down one of the best professors I have had at DePaul. The work is very demanding and will somewhat take over your life at times, but Dr. Cohn gives you so many opportunities to review and meet up individually. Definitely go to his coffee and questions sessions. Lectures were always concise, clear, and animated. Awesome to start bio with</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Cohn rules! very helpful, especially in lab. He really knows his stuff and makes good use of illustrations and examples. He definitely keeps my attention in lecture. 10/10 would take again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2013<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class covers A LOT of information, and the tests are deadly, but Dr. Cohn gives his students a lot of opportunities to bring their grades up. Lab and quizzes are easy, just study hard for the tests and do the practice tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst class I took all quarter. I did not learn anything at all, clickers are annoying and attendance is mandatory. All he does is read off powerpoints. I do not recommend him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2012<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Cohn is a really good teacher! I would recommend him to anyone! His interesting, engaging, and really knowns what he is talking about. He makes tons of information easily accessible to you and is always up for answering questions!  He even holds "Coffee, Cocoa, and Questions" every Friday where he gives coffee and cocoa and talks through materi</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2012<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He got major swag points. He gives you everything you need for Bio. Class notes, vocabulary words, PowerPoints, Quiz questions at least a week before you have to take it. He is a amazing teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>print out his powerpoint notes before each lecture and make sure you understand the main ideas on these notes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2011<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed his lectures very much but you'll need to study on your own a lot because its definitely not a an easy course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2010<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class material is pretty easy, however this class is too much work.  I've never had a more unrewarding and time consuming lab class.  Stan treats you like you're 15 again by making attendance mandatory and grades you on material he hasnt covered every class expecting you to teach yourself as if this is your only class. Worst teacher ever!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2009<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher, but he's annoyingly childish. Also, this is supposed to be a 200-level class. The material was BIO 101 all over again, and they treated us like high schoolers. If you want to be a science major at DePaul, switch to chemistry. That's what I did immediately after taking Cell Bio. The chem program at DePaul is far more rewarding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2009<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cohn is a really nice guy and is willing to help. He does give you a lot of study material, but the powerpoint are useless if you dont go to class. His midterms and final is IMPOSSIBLE. His grades are curved 85&lt; is an A. Trust me, there is a reason for that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2009<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher for a Hard Class...couldn't put it in a better way. Powerpoint lecture style with strong emphasis on central concepts. Labs are long but fun. Tests are hard but he posts alot of online practice. He is a little quirky in class and begins with a corny joke. Also gives weekly online quizzes. Got an A-, but missed like 4 quizzes...haha</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2009<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He always was in lab helping out and answering questions. overall very helpful and nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2009<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is like an extenstion of organic chem only molecular bio. Heavy powerpoints go over all the things he wants. Offers 4-5 practice midterms and finals with answers. All in all, he is a good teacher for a little harder class. Study smart here, dont read the book per say...only review. Labs are long but tolerable...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2007<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hardest tests ever! He throw totally unexpected things on there that you would've never thought to study like identifying pictures or identifying chemical structures. Doesn't tell you what is on the test at all  and make sure you start studying way early unless you want to fail. Labs are long and have a lot of parts and class is boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2007<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He starts each class with a joke... and although they are generally corny... it's what makes them so funny.  He really tries to have class demos that give a visual to the course material being taught.  He is a great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2006<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Agreeed.  He does act really nice in class, then very annoyed when you talk to him outside of class.  If you don't need out of class interaction, then take him cause he's great in the classroom.  Kinda a hard grader also, I should have gotten an A but got a B</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2006<br>Class Name: BIO<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i agree he has 2 personalities, in class he plays a nice and a funny guy but when you go to see him outside of the class like advising he makes you feel like youre wasting his time</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2006<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2006<br>Class Name: CELLBIOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Cohn seems to have two different personalities. In class he is helpful and seems interested in helping his studnets. However in private you can tell that he is very bitter and phony person. The tests are very difficult, and poorly written. Be prepared to study well ahead of time, and read the test questions carefully.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2006<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The midterm and final are hard; there's no real study guide and you're basically told to know everything which is hard because you might end up studying details that aren't even on the exam. Prepare for the exam weeks ahead.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2005<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has the corniest jokes ever... but sometimes it just makes your day.  His lectures are excellent and with the new interactive system it is hard to fall asleep in class.  He is good at explaining things you dont understand on a one on one basus as needed, and his labs were tremendous.  Just go to class and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2005<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is sooo much material, and he might test you on the small details, but all the information is given in class. He is very helpful outside of class. I recommend studying for a week before each of his tests. This is not an easy class, it is all memorization.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2005<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There was a lot of material for the class but Dr. Cohn was really helpful. He made it clear that he was available to help and was present at all of the labs. Dr. Cohn covered everything that was to be on the final and midterm during class. There was a lot of material but Dr. Cohn was there to help!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: CELLBIO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy,however I think the final was very unfair. I did well in the rest of the class, but there was so much information to study, and the final killed me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2005<br>Class Name: CELLBIO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Cohen is a brilliant professor and he really, genuinely cares about students' understanding of the material which is rare.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2004<br>Class Name: CELLBIO<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>his very detailed power points help. however, this class is ALL memorization. horrible jokes that make him seem kind during class, but he has no sense of humor outside of class. quite a condescending personality.  i got an A in this class but it was the hardest bio class that i've taken.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2004<br>Class Name: BIO250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very happy with this professor's teaching style, FYI he's the Bio department chair, like to use PowerPoint- makes things easier. Bad jokes, but good professor. Wants you to learn and will help to best of his ability. If you have a problem - talk to him.</div></div></div></body></html>
