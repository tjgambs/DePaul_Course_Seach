Really interesting lectures. Always lets you out at least 30 minutes early. She wants you to understand and enjoy linguistics, which is more than I can say for other linguistics professors. Helpful and makes it understandable. This was definitely one of the best night classes I've ever taken. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: CMN201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy and helpful teacher. Gives easy weekly quizzes and even gives extensions for every paper. How many professors do that&#63; Definitely take her for relaxed class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: CMN211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So nice!There is a sample quiz, midterm & final.All notes on ppt and she makes EXACT study guides.Attendance is taken everyday & offers xtra credit.Class can tend to be boring if no 1 participates.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: CMN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are her reading PowerPoints to you. Very boring. Print them and use as study guides, but you don't need to pay attention in class. Takes attendance, is an easy teacher though and pretty funny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: CMN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although her lectures were a little dry, they were still SOOO helpful especially when test time and PPts wer always posted on blackboard.  She reads and comments on rough drafts that u submit for 3 fun, short papers.  She grades easy and as long as u come to class and participate when u can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2005<br>Class Name: CMN202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>talks too damn slow...class was sooo boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2005<br>Class Name: CMN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXCELLENT TEACHER! Anyone that didn't like her class was lazy and didn't either participate in class or do the reading.  She is VERY nice and doesn't even require you to do your homework it is only assigned as a tool to help you with the class.She is also very kind with her grading. LOVED HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2005<br>Class Name: CMN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wouldn't recommend her. She is reallllly nice, but maybe a bit too much. She uses the slides made for the book- just real boring, but pretty easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2005<br>Class Name: CMN203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor.  If you do the reading you'll become interested in the class and disscussions.  i found that the people who didnt read didnt participate and were bored.  i would take her again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2004<br>Class Name: CMN203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class could have been interesting and really good. Instead, it was useless. Truman, the TA was annoying and slowed the class down/confused most of us. We broke up into small discussion groups far too often when the best discussions were w/the class as a whole. Good choice of movies, though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2004<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, very understanding. the lectures are boring, but that the worst part. very good grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2004<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She sucks as a public speaker. Her lecture consists of repeating everything word for word without anything of her own. Booooooring !!! The only good thing is that the lectures are not mandatory, only your and other people's speeches.</div></div></div></body></html>
