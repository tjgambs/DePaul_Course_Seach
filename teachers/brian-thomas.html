Not just because he is down-to-earth and a nice guy, but he cares about his students succeeding. Each class is centered around a case study, no textbooks are used. I reccommend Professor Thomas to all Finance majors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2009<br>Class Name: FIN312<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Thomas really knows his stuff and his bright/comical personality makes class very enjoyable. He's a VP for JP Morgan and constantly incorporates real-life stories/situations. He's also a CFA and got his M.B.A. at Cornell. It's hard to believe how young and down to earth he is. I learned A LOT from Thomas and I'd recommend him to anyone.</div></div></div></body></html>
