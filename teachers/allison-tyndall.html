Fair grader considering i didn't give a full effort. attendance counts. the final portfolio is a big part of your grade. i liked her she is pretty easy, idk what else i can say.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2008<br>Class Name: CSS201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did not like her at all. She will grade you poorly if she doesn't agree with you. She is a terrible listener. I felt as if I knew more about the subject matter than she did. She tries too hard to act like your friend. She isn't helpful outside of class. I don't reccomend her at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was pretty awesome.  The work is hard, and there is a lot of it, and she will take off points if she doesn't agree with you BUT the classes were pretty interesting, I didn't mind sitting there for three hours and she lets you out early/will give you an A on stuff sometimes just for showing up.  Great teacher, I totally recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher. I'm one of those slackers who gets good grades on essays and  doesn't really do the homework. She cares about your grades and will meet with you outside of class. She shows youtube clips to show her point. Shes a cool teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
