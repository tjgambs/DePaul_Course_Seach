He is a difficult teacher and he makes you think. I felt like the class was more like a survey of Philosophical literature rather than an actual intro to philosophy class. I wish he dealt more with the fundamentals of philosophy rather than having us read a bunch of random authors. Thats my personal opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: PHL243<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved the movies that we watched, it was a tuesday night class, he let us out at about 8:30. Half the class time is spent going over the homework assignment and the rest is watching 1/2 a movie and then discussing that. Weekly reading assignments, 2 papers. He's arrogant,but strait forward enough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2008<br>Class Name: PHL365<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think Artis is a really sweet professor.  I had a good time in the 100 level, and an even better time in the 17-18th century empiricism class.  There were nice discussions, and he really interested me in philosophy. He has also become a freind of mine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a typical philosophy class. You have reading every night, with mindless question sets that are there just to show that you've read. Then the next day in class you go over the exact same questions as a class. Nice guy, and it's easy enough to figure out what he wants. Class isn't hard, but mindless,you feel like you are high school again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a nice guy. There is a lot of reading but it's not too bad. The second half of the quarter is worse then the first. There are two papers, and two presentations on whatever you want to talk about, which is kind of cool. He's really nice and listens to everyone's opinion. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>PHL 100 with Prof. Artis was a cool class to take. He really opens your mind to the outside world and he is intelligent. I would say it's not your typical intro to Philosophy, there was no textbook, only readings. 3 papers, 2 presentations, and weekly readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class! There's a lot of reading, but you can just skim it most of the time. He's a pretty radical guy so if your conservative I wouldn't take his class. Also if you go into this class expecting to learn about Aristotle and Plato you'd be very wrong. He forces you to make connections with modern world and see things for what they are.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>is a very hard professor...says at the beggining of the quarter that he will grade hard..very boring class...alot of reading!! alot!!..dont take this professor for philosophy..have to do 4 papers and a 2 minute speech at the end of each unit..a 9-11 page paper for a final..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2006<br>Class Name: PHL365<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is basically a discussion of the assigned reading. There is a decent amount of reading due every class but you will do okay if you just skim through the material. Grade is based on 4 short papers (3 pages), 4 class presentations of those papers, and a final 10 page paper. He is a good guy but has radical ideas, but will respect your opinions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is definitly alot of reading for this class!  But, he doesn't test, which is nice.  Inside he has you do a three page paper every two weeks, and he does like it when you try to expand on the thoughts in the class, he likes you to stick to the book.   just don't expect much from the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: PHL117<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He, as a professor, is pretty cool. He assigns a LOT of reading. A LOT OF READING. He also writes really small on the board so either sit close or pay attention. He wants a paper every two weeks for this class. No exams, but a final paper. He also talks very evenly. Doesnt get excited. But he does expect class commentary and participation. He's OK.</div></div></div></body></html>
