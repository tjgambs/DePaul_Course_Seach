Professor Chu is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and is usually available to assist you if you have any problems.  Rarely used the textbook because the slides and study material are much easier to understand, however, the extra practice problems may be useful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2015<br>Class Name: CSC400<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is very difficult, especially if taken in a 5 week course. Chu says that you shouldn't take it in the 5 weeks and I agree, it's just too much information too fast. He is incredibly helpful though. If you have questions, make sure to ask him. He is very knowledgeable. Also gets back to emails very quick. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: CSC400<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Chu is brilliant. He teaches in a way that focuses on concepts, not rote memory, so I did a lot better than I thought. There is a slight language barrier for English-speakers, especially when viewing recorded lectures. All in all a cool guy who is generous. My best results came from communication via email and he's quick to respon</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: CSC321<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice guy. lectures are pretty boring and no one really pays attention. attendance is not mandatory so if you do the assignments and show up on exam days you're fine. The way he grades exams is not the same way he says he would. He takes off 1 point for questions that worth 3. his later assignments are unnecessarily long. not hard. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2014<br>Class Name: CSC400<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel bad saying this but he's the worst professor I've ever had at depaul and I'm genuinely interested in the subject. He's knowledgeable about the subject, but seems unable to explain it in a way that students understand. Even when half the class admits they can't follow his train of thought, he doesn't do anything to address the problem. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2014<br>Class Name: CSC400<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really smart guy - knows his stuff real well. However, he runs through material quickly and is hard to follow. Course material is dated and not as thorough as I'd prefer for a graduate course. I had to do a lot of looking up items on my own to keep up. He is a nice guy though, just tough to follow. He is an easy grader which helps.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2013<br>Class Name: CSC400<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice guy that knows his stuff.  But he is not the best at explaining the content, and he has clearly lost a grip on what it is like for someone to view the material for the first time.  He likes to move very fast.  He will appreciate if you show up early and often and ask questions, he will do his best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2013<br>Class Name: CSC393<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I-Ping Chu has no idea how to instruct students in understanding algorithms for data structures. I have heard he is equally as difficult for those trying to learn basic C/C++. Avoid him if at all possible. The book he uses for Data Structures is useless and way outdated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, if you know programming then this will be easy for you, if you don't this class will be kinda fast for you, but he will try and try to get you to speed, just ask!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2012<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Chu is a nice guy and he tries to be really helpful to his students, but it's still a very hard class. He moves fast and it seems like he expects you to understand the material before you've really learned it. He's a pretty easy grader, which is how I got by in the class, but I didn't really learn much and was unprepared for CSC 212.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He definitely knows his programming, however he does not translate this well to students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Data structures is a tough class irrespective of where you take it but Chu made even more painful by focusing on topics (e.g. solving math theorems) he was interested in. Don't take this class with him if you need this to graduate or move on to another class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2010<br>Class Name: CSC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for Data Structures and Algorithms in Java. He is terrible at teaching the material in a way that is even slightly comprehensible. He clearly is a smart person and has a phd, but cannot present material at the level of the class. He doesn't teach; you have to teach yourself, and will struggle to fit your code within the parameters he sets.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2010<br>Class Name: CSC393<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had to drop because I couldn't understand him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2010<br>Class Name: CSC393<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the best professor for DL students.  Difficult to understand on recordings due to his accent and tendency to speak very quickly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2009<br>Class Name: CSC224<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not for beginners to programming but a refreshers course to those who are comfortable with the basics.Prof Chu is easy to understand albeit his heavy Asian accent. Friendly and easy to communicate. Midterm/final is semi challenging. If you know how to code this will be an easy class for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2008<br>Class Name: CSC202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He'd rather tell jokes & dance around students' questions because he &quot;doesn't want to give away the answer&quot; instead of actually providing any sort of useful help or--*gasp*--TEACHING. He rambles instead of lecturing, & his notes are confusing at best. The only reason I pulled off an A is because I've taken discrete math before & I re-taught myself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2008<br>Class Name: CSC309<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: CSC224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor!! I finally learned Java. The class wasn't so bad!! I did really well, even though some projects were kind of challenging but overall not so bad. I learned a lot about Java that I didn't know before, so I recommend taking this professor!!!! I was honored to be in your class Professor thanks for a great semester!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2007<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a little funny, nice guy, problem with the English language is the issue, exercises are easy and he is cool.

One of the best! Really helps you out and makes sure you understand the material! Any issues you may bring up he will work with you. A very nice guy, and gives great notes! Lets you download power-point presentation with notes! A definity recommendation for him!</div></div></div></body></html>
