He is also very unclear when giving lectures. I had more help from the T.A. than I did from him. He's nice and not too hard of a grader but he assigns a LOT of complicated busy work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend this professor. This was a decent class. Not very challenging, we only learned one new thing per day, but he explained it very clearly. Also not much homework, just in class group assignments and a few homework assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the worst math teach I've had.  He doesn't explain anything and is super BORING.  Why am I paying $50,000 a year to have an 80-year-old teach me how to use a computer? AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is boring and he is a terrible professor. He has a hard time communicating with the class and his grading is ridiculously picky. Probably one of the worst professors I have had at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One word best describes Paul Sisul's LSP 121 class: BUSYWORK. Expect to complete a group project every class, and be given homework assignments every week. Also, while the work is pretty straight forward, expect him to be a STICKLER when grading. Seriously - this guy takes his job teaching an entry level class way too seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2012<br>Class Name: CSC379<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class that satisfies your junior year experiential learning requirement. You have to volunteer 25 hours at a school, and assist with their tech needs. You have to post weekly journals of your volunteering experience, and write a group paper. I went to class twice and got an A. This class was outrageously easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so easy, He doesnt really explain the info that well, but if you have any questions he will come to you&explain exactly how to do it. You can use cheatsheets for the 2 exams and i NEVER did work outside of the classroom, you get out 40 minutes early every day so i would stay and do the homework that was due that week&he would walk me thru it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2009<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy, Hard to stay awake in class however. If you show up, no reason you shouldn't get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2009<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh my God. This class made me want to bang my head on my glass desk. His voice is unbearable and he cannot teach for anything. He says attendence is not mandatory but you get a 0 for the activity and nothing can be made up. Believe me you will WANT to ditch this class ALWAYS. Horrific. He should be retired already. It's easy if you go EVERY time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2008<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ehhh....how else can I say really boring&#63; Very monotone, not very enthusiastic, and cannot keep the students interested.  Not exactly someone I would recomend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2008<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh Rev. Sisul... Thank God this class was so easy because if it were any more complicated, the whole class would fail. ISP 121 is insanely easy so don't worry about his lack of teaching skills because he basically gives you the answer everytime you raise your hand for help. Really, really, really easy class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2007<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy but soooo BORING. Also, he doesn't really help. He gets confused himself when trying to help. He is slow in comprehending things and slow in providing help. He's nice, but I don't think he can teach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2004<br>Class Name: INTERNETANDWEB<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool profesor, very clear and helpful.   I knew nothing about this class and got an A.  Midterm and finaly is easy if you study the practice tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2004<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Class, Great Professor, Great Over all!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2004<br>Class Name: DC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Paul is a sweet guy, but boring as hell.  I think this is the first class he taught, the Dean, Dr. Epp, started team teaching the course with him and now he teaches it himself.  It's hard to go to class because it is so boring.</div></div></div></body></html>
