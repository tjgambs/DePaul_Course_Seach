The case study was INSANE with the amount of time it took up due to a lack of guidence on what was expected. You can get an A in the class if you put the time in, but the time is high even for a grad class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2008<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Way too easy to the point I didn't learn anything.

Disaster.  Unfair, unclear, ambigious and mean.  She thinks she is god's gift to marketing when in fact all she teaches you about is her experience as a pharm rep.  I would avoid this, what a waste of time and money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If u can, take someone else cuz she's not an easy teacher compared to other profs who teach this class. No midterm, no final. Mltple choice quiz every week;takes best 6 out of 8 quizez;2 env. scans; occasionally gives xtra credit worth 1-3 points each. Quizes are kind of hard - other profs give take home quizes. She's a powerpoint teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2005<br>Class Name: 555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very very disorganized.  Asks super broad questions and demands super specific answers with little direction on graded assinments. Never has anything labeled properly, we never knew when things were due, what section, etc.   Very critical of others yet her own teaching style is a total mess. AVOID AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I cant believe I paid $2700 for this class.She is poorly organized she cant tell you when papers are due.She reads DIRECTLY from her powerpoint slides,she cant answer direct question about the book.She is very anti depaul and told the class that our MBA's were worth little and the school itself was a joke.She only has a job to cover quotas imo.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She will make the class stand if no one wants to talk.  Makes you feel like youre in kindergarden. Her quiz questions are irrelevant to what is on her powerp or book...extremely tricky quizes.  Run Run or she will hunt you down and eat you!  I would not take her if i knew!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2004<br>Class Name: MKT360<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simply useless. She's a powerpoint professor who decided to skip out on class one too many times. Her negative commments to groups after their presentation (in fron of the class mind you) were hurtful and extremely inapropriate. Not to mention that her teaching style is extremely subjective.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: MKT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor, do the reading and check the website from the cd-rom, and do the assignments.

If you want a guaranteed B+ to A, take her.  Her lectures have nothing to do with the famous 8 quizes,(from book's website)she is a waste of my $$$Choice is yours! Grades vs. Knowledge..tough</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont take her!!

She can also stand and talk for 2 hours.... There is not midterm or final.  Your grade is mostly based on your best 5 quizes out of 8.
