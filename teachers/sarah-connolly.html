Her tests are super hard too and there's only 2 of them (not including the final, obviously). Also there are quizzes every week but those are online and pretty easy in general.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2015<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a challenging class because theres so much material to cover in such little time, but she posts all her lectures online, uses an online question generator, answer any questions you have, and really wants you to succeed. No HW except online quizzes, but STUDY for the tests!!!! compared to the other bio teachers, she's the best one. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2015<br>Class Name: MICROBIOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>She is incredibly passionate about biology and that helps make the subject more interesting.  The material was a bit challenging, but if you keep up with the work and set aside enough study time (even if just the week prior to an exam) you will be fine.  She's a very nice person as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2014<br>Class Name: HLTH320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I actually look forward to class! She answers questions and talks about new research. I would take another class form her in a second.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2014<br>Class Name: BIO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite professor and my favorite class ever! Super fun, interesting and pretty easy too. She's very helpful and willing to talk to you.You can tell she is excited by what she teaches and that excitement and interest really rubs off. Seriously, I wish I could take this class again because I loved it so much and I know many who agree. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2014<br>Class Name: BIO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class. She isn't afraid to go off topic when something is interesting.  Not at all an easy class, but interesting.  Take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2014<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>I really did not enjoy this class. She reads directly off her power points and simple made the class not enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2014<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of material so you have to keep up. She ties later ideas back to earlier points which is helpful.  Its a weed-out class, so I wasnt surprised that it was hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2013<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Connolly was not very helpful/clear. She makes the material more complicated then it needs to be. Just read the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Connolly was very clear and easy to understand. While the material was complex (by necessity), she made good use of limited time and I felt I learned the material. I highly recommend Dr. Connolly!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2013<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Connolly is an amazing professor. She makes the tests clear and there is never any surprise material on it. If you go to class and keep up with the material it's easy to get an A. She makes biology interesting and is super passionate about it. Definitely take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor that comes prepared to teach, not to collect her paycheck.  She has great slides that are perfectly clear and easy to follow.  Power Points are left online so lecture and note taking are optional but encouraged.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not helpful, goes way to fast, reads off her power points why even bother coming to class. Don't take this class unless you have a passion for bio and science and make sure your TA is good mine sucks. Bio at DePaul is a fail</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2013<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is hard, but she told us that the first day. So far, she answers questions and interacts. Seems nice.  Notes are clear. I better keep up!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2013<br>Class Name: HLTH202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very kind! Nothing was unfair or came as a surprise. I enjoyed and learned a lot from her lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2013<br>Class Name: HLTH202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best prof I've had at DePaul! She makes the material interesting and answers questions in class.  Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2013<br>Class Name: BIO210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Connolly makes exams directly from the lecture slides, which are available online. If you memorize the slides and study what she tells you for lab quizzes, the class is nothing too difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2013<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to get an A in Bio, do not take her. She goes super fast and the topics are detailed. Just read the book and review power-points. It didn't help if you had a bad TA for Lab. Worst Bio 191.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2012<br>Class Name: HLTH202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof! Lots of papers to read and not too much in the textbook. As long as you read the papers before class, you'll be fine.  Her study guide was right on.  She loves research and you can tell. The final project was actually fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2012<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class covers a lot of stuff pretty fast, but she is really helpful and always answers questions. She posts her powerpoint slides - so you can print them before or after class.  I'd definitely take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2012<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is TERRIBLE. Reads off powerpoints, what's the point of coming to class? She doesn't know how to teach, or explain anything shes reading. Tests were based off the book, her lectures were pointless. Might as well teach yourself bio if you take it with her. Went to her office for help, she didn't help much at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2012<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She teaches off the power points & goes super fast so if you haven't taken biology in a couple years be prepared to stay on top of things. I feel that over all she was not a bad teacher but should explain things more than just reading off the power points. I would take her class again now that I know her teaching style.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2012<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she teaches off powerpoints in class and then puts them up on online afterwards, which is really helpful. she answers any questions you have during class and is really sweet. she does go pretty fast thought, so you have to stay on top of things. the tests were hard but that is something to expect with bio. i would recommend her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She uses powerpoints, and she is so sweet! Will answer all of your questions. Go see her after class! Love her!!!!! She goes fast, so be prepared.</div></div></div></body></html>
