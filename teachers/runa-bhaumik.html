She took my favorite subject and totally dried it out. She also made a lot of mistakes when displaying example codes for the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2010<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so far it is great!!! professor is is always helpful and want us to learn the material. although the course material is hard for 100 level course with no prerequisites.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2010<br>Class Name: CSC324<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very knowledgeable in her subject, helpful. has little accent but that's not an issue at all to understand  the materials with lots of handouts</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2010<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DON'T TAKE IT-240 UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO (& if you have to take this class, take it with someone else). It's horrible & awful & boring. I don't know how she's still teaching. She just drones on for an hour & 1/2.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2009<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her accent is kind of hard to understand but she gives handouts to read which helps.  The class is easy, but really boring.  She moves very slowly through the material.  I wouldn't take this class unless you have to or need a GPA booster.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2009<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Want an easy A&#63; Take this class with this professor. Want to feel like you actually learned something, and got some value out of the class&#63; Avoid it at all costs...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2009<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Half the time she doesn't seem to know what she's talking about! A lot of her examples didn't work, her accent is irritating (she's got a verbal tic, she says right&#63; a LOT!), and the time spent in the lab, she shows how to do things manually that can easily be done with Access's built-in functions. Take this class with someone else if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2009<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice lady, always seemed to be happy and energetic to teach. Her accent is not that hard to get past. The homework is not bad at all, and she is always willing to help. Overall, a fairly easy course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a thick accent, you have to pay attention very closely to understand. The subject matter is easy and activities and homeworks are as well. I think she knows the subject matter and always seemed willing to help if it was needed. Help never seemed needed and everyone wanted to teach themselves..seeing as lectures went over our heads.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is difficult to understand at first, but if you get past the accent and focus you can understand her. Once you're past that, she does a pretty good job for an ISP teacher. She waits for people to ask questions but, nobody really does. She's really helpful if you show interest and ask questions to her personally. One of the better ISP teachers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2008<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with everything the other person said. She is impossible to understand! She is clearly very smart, but she cannot teach to people who don't know the material. She also gets so frustrated with us for asking questions when we get confused. This is probably the most frustrating class I've ever taken.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2008<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is awful!!! She's hard to understand, she jumps all over the place; takes forever to grade - one of the worse teachers I have had at DePaul! Stay away - ISP 121 is ridiculous anyway but she just makes it almost unbearable!</div></div></div></body></html>
