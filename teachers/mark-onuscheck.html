Sent plenty of reminder emails and was very thorough. Lots of discussion posts, but it wasn't too bad. Assigned TEDTalks, movies, and articles to discuss. Didn't use a book. A few papers and you are required to attend a workshop (I attended an online one). Not a bad choice for JYEL.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2012<br>Class Name: ENG101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best teacher I've ever had!

I don't rate a lot of teachers, but this guy... brilliant, knowledgeable, helpful, fun, encouraging. You'll learn a lot and yet not feel like you're learning.

Its assumed we work a lot and have a full load of classes, so I was a little confused about why we had as many assignments as we did.  Most other people get to kind of take it easy in this class...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2009<br>Class Name: ISP254<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for Corporate Social Responsibility.   Truly cool stuff. The course readings and assignments are really well organized and intense.  He teaches you how to take your thinking forward with a patterns.

He communicated more with me than my professors in a regular class.  Just keep up with the online forums.  The readings are actually useful.  Agreed:  Great feedback, high standards.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: ISP350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's quite an easy class.  The tough part is staying on top of things because it's online... but his grading is not so bad, and just do the forums.  If you spend 3 hours in class every week when not online, take 1 hour each week to respond to forums, and you're golden.  Papers take no longer than 1-2 hours to write, each.  Was fairly interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2006<br>Class Name: ISP252<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome guy, great profoessor and super nice!  He really made the class as easy as he could while still trying to keep us learning.

It is a terrible boring subject matter and he is not an easy grader.  The boring, boring discussions will ensure you get a terrible grade unless you like replying 24/7.  The professor does not cut anyone any slack, tough with grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2005<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2005<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy going and helpful.

Very intelligent but hilarioius with a great sense of humor.  He knows how to relate to students as well as make a class like world masterpieces acc. interesting. Great to joke around with and very helpful!</div></div></div></body></html>
