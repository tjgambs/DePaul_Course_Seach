She always made her assignments clear; however, she was not a very interesting lecturer. That may be due to the subject content, though.

She is upbeat and really knows her stuff. She will always help you and is very interactive with the class. TAKE HER! She makes learning fun and she is very understanding of anything that you might even be going through. She is very flexible in helping her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Very fun prof.
