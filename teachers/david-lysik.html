    The final exam was tough, but all in all I think fair.  Lectures are always interesting. I really think I learned more about religion in this quarter that I have in my whole like going to church. Be prepared to think theologically, not just spit back the same old religious fluff, as he calls it.

    This guy is awesome. Midterm was take home, final was a bit harder than I thought. Weekly one page synthesis papers that aren't that bad. Good sense of humor. He sometimes rambles on but its always relevant. He makes religion very interesting and totally unbiased when teaching. I would recommend him over most professors!

    Honestly this was my favorite class this quarter. He is so freaking funny and just an enjoyable class. He goes on tangents but you wont mind at all. The midterm and final is hard though, he does not play around with that. And there's the weekly paper but other than that, this was my favorite class this quarter. I RECOMMEND HIM

    Professor Lysik is great! He was always so fun and happy everyday in class. He got the class laughing everyday! Around all of the laughs he did teach us some extremely valuable religious insights. He was able to get the historical message of the New Testament across to everyone in the class in a really fun and thought provoking way!

    Pretty easy class and Lysik is very entertaining and never know what will happen next. Weekly synthesis papers is your homework and online quizzes based on textbook reading. Doesn't give you anything that a student can't handle.

    Want to be challenged? Want every thought you've had about Christianity to be put into question? Take Lysik. I entered this class an atheist know-it-all; I left a lover of theology. Just a heads up: he has no problem telling students they're wrong.

    Prof Lysik plays this sort of devil's advocate role trying to find (as he says) the  contours and limits of your ideas.  Some students found that to be threatening but I thought it was the most challenging class, getting me to think of things I never thought of before. And to have a logical, structured way of discussing things.

    Professor Lysik is HILARIOUS. Assignments are due every class, but they only take 20-30min to do. The material can get to be a little dull and repetitive, but he makes it worth it. He pokes fun at students and makes everyone laugh. TAKE HIM HE'S THE BEST.

    I love Professor Lysik! The subject and lectures are kind of boring, but overall the class is easy with a small workload. Quizzes about once a week, but he gives the exact answers in his notes. He's really funny too and makes the  class enjoyable! I would definitely recommend.

    Great FUNNY teacher. He really is hilarious and cool. The work is tough and if you wanna slack off this is not who you wanna take a class with. But as long as you do the work and honestly get it done with ahead of time its smooth sailing. He's NOT a hard teacher, little goofy with the grades but not a hard teacher at all. WOULD DEF RECOMMEND!

    For a summer course it was a lot of reading, but it wasn't unbearable. I got away with not reading alot but taking notes in class. Breifs were easy.He kept me interested in the subject throughout the class; some people gave him flack about &quot;being mean&quot;, but he really just has a lot of energy and teaches like a law class. take if interested in law!

    I did not enjoy Professor Lysik's course.  He was a very unfair grader on all of the case briefs that I turned in and expected way too much reading and assignments for a summer course.  I do not recommend taking this professor.

    Professor Lysik has got to be the most enthusiastic professor I have had yet at DePaul. He is very much into religion, especially liturgy, and makes his classes interesting. You will learn a lot.  The final exam is a bit rough but you cover a lot of mateial.

    He is very funny and will even answer the quiz questions if you just ask him. However, you should know the answers to these quizzes because he bases them straight off the notes he writes on the board, which is very little. It's just that his lectures can be a little bit boring if you're not into the history of catholicism. 9/10!

    Awesome teacher! Quizes are definitely easy but sometimes the briefs can take an hour a piece...if you really try to read and understand them. Which on certain nights can turn out to 3 hours of hwk.  Def recomend him and this class. p.s. not for slackers miss a quiz or don't like to read, and you will not get through this class, unless you like Cs

    D. Lysik is a very good professor. He makes clear guidelines for the course and follows them closely. Class based on writing a Case Brief and Weekly Summary once per week; there is a take home midterm and final is part take home part in class. Through provoking class, yet not too difficult.

    Rel/Politics - no textbook, only read cases and do case briefs. Pretty easy, and he's pretty funny too. If you have a strong opinion about something, he will play devil's advocate to screw with you which could annoy some people. But overall, an enjoyable class. Midterm and final were easy (write an opinion for a fictional case)

    Took him for religion and law. Awesome teacher everything is pretty clear. If you just do the work you should be able to get at least an A-. Midterm and Final are court opinions. In order to do those well just don't do them at the last minute. Great teacher, sorta weird but that just makes him more fun. Talk to him if you have problems.

    I took Lysik for my focal point and I was not disappointed at all. He is a former lawyer and does a great job teaching the course. We have weekly summary papers which are a guaranteed 100% as long as you aren't braindead.He gives good feedback for your mock opinion, which many people failed to utilize. Recommended highly.

    He is really animated. Come to class, take notes, do summaries and you'll get an A. Not hard. Tends to ramble a little. Over all, its an easy A.

    AWESOME CLASS! This class is ridiculously easy. No textbooks. Doesnt take attendance. One 5 minute ppt presentation w/ partner, 2 observer reports where you go to mass, weekly 1pg summaries and quizzes that are easy! He pretty much tells you exactly what questions will be on the quiz. No midterm. Final is a bit hard, but overall fun easy class!

    I think he was pretty good for the most part. He definitely made the material less tedious especially for an 8:30 class. But he is a smart ass sometimes and he isn't really inviting for asking for help. The case briefs were graded pretty easily but the mid-term and final were ridiculous. You have to really like law to like this class!

    Easy A if you go to class and take notes. Weekly papers summarizing the info from the last weeks classes. 3 papers that require you to go to church, but you have a partner to make it easier. The final is 100 questions, but if you go over your notes it's a piece of cake.

    his class for the mean part is relatively easy. weekly summary papers and 3 observer reports. However his final is difficult. There are 30 questions based on orders of rituals. if you miss one, u miss it all. He is a smart ass when u ask for help. and he isnt the type to bump u up to and a if u have an 89. i dont think he cares much about students

    Really knows the material. Repeats himself, but I've been Catholic all my life and never heard any of the stuff he teaches so I guess thats good.  He has just such a different way to takl about religion. Weekly summary papers and you have to go to church three times.

    You literally do nothing all quarter. It's boring. You have to write a lame paper for a final and our class average was like a C-. You don't have to show up to class, but if you don't you'll miss info for the final. Overall, do not recommend.

    This guy is just great.I wasent really looking forward to having to take a religion class, but he makes the class interesting.  He tells the subject matter like it is and makes sure that everyone in the class understands what he is talking about and stresses on the information that will be on exams.  Makes the class funny.

    Awesome professor! Explains the material very clearly and makes the subject interesting. Weekly quizzes are straight from the notes and very easy. mid-term was a breeze and for the final just memorize the notes you took all quarter. Also, an extremely easy grader on papers. Great professor/class.

    Good dude.  He knows the subject very well but is opinionated to the left.  However, he is receptive to good argument and is very fair.  Plenty of case briefs (look cases up at oyez.org or gov&#63; and justicia.org, com, or gov for clarity).  He leaves out some requisite info in his case files.  Do all the work, you'll do fine!

    He's definitely NOT the worst at DePaul. I even think he's one of the best religion instructors I've had. His jokes are lame, but he knows A LOT about religion, and cares if you catch on to what hes saying.

    The class was never boring and he explained things well.He made religion interesting and always joked around but when it comes to grading he is HARD! He marks off on any little mistake and the midterm and final are pretty difficult.

    This is the best religion class to take at depaul, the class is a blast the whole time, his humor is great.  But don't let that fool you and think that this is an easy class, because its not. The papers are very involved and the midterm and final are pretty challenging, and I went to catholic high school! Pick Lysik and you will not be dissapointed

    very nice and funny professor, but he grades hard as hell. he lets you submit things late if you ask. The take home midterm's class average was 35out of 50 :-(    One thing though he is very passionate of the subject and you do learn alot.

    He is a wonderful professor and really knows his material. I took him for a night class and it wasn't that bad, he let us out early most of the time. I learned so much from this class. You do have to attend seven churches and write about them, but other then that it is all good. Really recommend thi

    David Lysik has a clear passion about the subject he teaches and if you really want to learn, his class is superb. His clear teachings makes an otherwise boring subject easy to take.

    Considering it was a religion class and hes a minister, he was a great teacher!  The work may seem kinda overwelming at first, but really your big assignments dont come till the end of the quarter.  I took it as a night class and it wasnt bad at all.

    I took Lysik for the Christian Experience and it was easily one of the biggest mistakes I ever made. He puts crazy things on the quizzes and exams, is a horrible grader and focuses too much on making jokes rather than explaining the subject. Ridiculous.

    Nice guy, kinda crazy.  Pretty unclear with what he wants.  Catholicism is not the kind of night class you are goign to want to take. Its WAY too long of a time period to learn about catholic liturgy.
