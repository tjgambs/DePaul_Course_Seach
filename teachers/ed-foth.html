    DO NOT TAKE HIM!!! This class is very hard as it is and he does it half online half in class. I need to be in class to learn and understand. He just posts the slides online and READS them. I think I am intelligent enough do read them myself. Very confusing. He knows a lot but one of those people that don't know how to teach.Avoid!

    Took him for corp tax. Avoid at all costs. Idk how he is allowed to teach. He doesnt care abt if the students learn only cares if he understands what he is teaching. Out of the 11 people i talked to in class all failed his midterm and he didnt really care. u will end up teaching yourself &amp; he covers more material than all my other classes combined.

    He made everyone even more confusing, by giving useless lecture where he just reads out bunch of numbers.  Not very clear on what he's saying, rarely writes anything for students. Huge curve because no one gets what he's doing. I can tell he prepares 10 minutes for his lecture. Textbook is no use since he emphasizes things not on the textbook

    You will live, breathe, and give up all weekends for this class. By the end you will be CPA ready and is completely worth taking! He is helpful during office hours. He cares about his students and teaches what you need to know... study hard!!! I would take him for every class I could!

    Hard course, great teacher. I wouldn't recommend him if you want an easy A. But, hey, its accounting! Attendance is mandatory. Miss one class, and you are in the dark. His manual helps, book is detailed and complicated. Midterm, final, 2 tax problems, lots of easy quizzes. I'd definitely take another course with him!

    Athletic personality for old guy. You realize that he has no intention of intimidating anyone. Teaches like a cpa review class putting in little effort and leaves you to study the hard work balance on your side. Since he goes at a fast pace usually we cant think of questions long after the lecture but makes up for it with a gigantic curve.

    One of those classes that you give up your weekends studying for! He gives out a lot of take home quizzes, 2 tax return problems near the end of the quarter, and one easy excercise handout. Make sure you do well on them because those points really matter! The midterm &amp; final were very hard -All MC but the curve was HUGE and get his study manual!

    Here's the bottom line, TAX IS HARD, FOTH IS NOT.  Foth was a great prof and made tax about as enjoyable as he could for a 5 week crash course over the summer quarter.  Work hard, you'll do fine.

    This professor is extremely difficult to understand in class. Usually, I'm so lost, I don't even know what questions to ask. My advice, do the homework problems so you'll understand a little of what he's talking about in class.

    foth as a professor is ok - nice guy, tries to be a bit funny, curves the grade. the topic itself it extremely difficult, detail orientated and really freaking sucks. oh, and it will take over your life for 10 weeks. if you aren't prepared to give up every weekend of the semester to study, you can't expect a good grade.

    Class is very challenging.  I got an A and used the suggested texts to take practice exams.  Really only need class notes that he hands out.   Went to office hours once and was not very friendly. in class he is pretty funny.  Overall a good class.

    Given its a tax class, you should expect it to be hard.  He's not all about throwing the material at you, but he'll try at times to go into some detail as to why tax laws are the way they are.  He has a sense of humor that can come off as rude to those on the receiving end, but come on, be a sport about it.  I hope to destroy him in golf one day.

    Hard class!  I studied a ton and this was my first B ever.  I was upset, but got over it - considering this class is impossible.  After tax with Foth, I decided to major in finance and avoid accounting at all costs.

    tough class... no way around that... he is a bit pompous, but i think that made me want to do better in his class.  Obviously a very smart man... he does as good a job as anyone in teaching the subject. i'd like to shoot golf with him someday.

    This is a tough class. He makes it easy with the handouts, and quizzes mostly come off of them. He will explain and go over things if necessary. You have to spend a lot of time reading and doing problems to really understand him and the materials.

    Good class! Teacher was helpful with handouts. Really study the handouts and do and understand the example problems they will help you a lot. Material can get very confusing. Should put in at least 15 or more hours for final. What you put into the class is what you will get out.
