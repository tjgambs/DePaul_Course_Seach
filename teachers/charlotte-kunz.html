Very nice, holds reasonable expectations, and paces the three hours pretty well. A pleasant surprise and solid pick for the abnormal requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, very open to helping students...lectures are interesting and so are the movies!</div></div></div></body></html>
