Her class provided insight into the racial issues that exist today in our multicultural society. She is really passionate about what she teaches and tries to share that passion with her students. It is not a blowoff class, but you will learn a lot. I walked out with a whole new perspective of myself and the world around me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unless you have no other REAL classes I would advise against taking her course. Too much work for a class of this level and she is a very critical grader. Quizzes are easy if you read but the papers are worth much more and she grades very hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is by far one of the most inspiring professors and classes I have come across during my three years in college. The course work-load is intense but as long as you know how to approach information with an open-mind and think critically, you will succeed in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEWARE: she has ridiculous expectations especially for a sophomore seminar. she expects 2 pg papers SINGLE spaced weekly. and hours and HOURS of weekly reading. she allows NO absences. the class and material is interesting but recommend different teacher! many dropped the class the first week.</div></div></div></body></html>
