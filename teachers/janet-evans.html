Her discussions were something I could have read online. She needs a better course curriculum and focus on how student's will use in the real world what she teaches in her class.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2015<br>Class Name: PRAS595<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Evans met with me outside of class on her lunch hour because I needed help. She also let the whole class take a quiz over because everyone did so bad she said it must be the quiz - not us. She kept class fun and was interested in what we had to say.  I like that about the class and professors who do that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD393<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>I liked this class a lot. Professor Evans made it fun and interesting, and brought real examples into her class. I also liked NOT having a textbook, instead she gave us weekly readings from AdAge, Google,and other sources that were very current.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD393<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendance was mandatory EVERY class. If you didn't arrive early or didn't speak more than once in class you would get a D for attendance. Set long and unnecessary busy assignments every week. Assignments were also very confusing and never clear. Would never take class again. Killed what could've been a fun/interesting class!!</div></div></div></body></html>
