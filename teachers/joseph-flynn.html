He made me like accounting. He focuses on the big picture of accounting instaed of mindless memorization. Do not buy the book; he does not use it. Weekly quizes, midterm, and final. No homework to hand in. My ideas about business have completely changed since this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2009<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My opinion of accounting truly changed after taking this class-I hated 101! Flynn is articulate, passionate, and VERY knowledge on the subject matter. He has this way of making the material stick in your head. Furthermore, he is able to link the concepts we learn in class to the business world. I really wish DePaul had more professors like him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>PAY ATTENTION, STUDY FOR QUIZZES, SAME QUESTIONS ON EXAMS AND STUDY HANDOUTS AND DO THE PROBLEMS OVER AND OVER AND YOU WILL GET AN A, MUST PARTICIPATE AND ATTEND CLASS ALSO GIVES EXTRA CREDIT</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So he finally taught Acc102 at DePaul this quarter and let me tell you, he's amazing!!

Attendance isn't mandatory, but it might as well be because he doesn't waste a single minute in class. No text book necessary either - he supplies note sheets for you to write on. Weekly quiz, midterm, and final, but all are very straight forward and from the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man truly cares about his students and maintains his professionalism at all times, unlike another ACC instructor. It saddens me that he does not teach 102, take him if you get a chance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2007<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HOT!HOT!HOT!

Hands out print outs of the notes every class. Everything is very straight forward and the weekly quizes are easy (like someone mentioned they are timed, but I couldn't imagine anyone needing the whole time he gives you to finish them).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: 102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, he knows everyones name. The class is kind of set up like a high school class, but he keeps you very interested. You have one quiz a week, which the only complaint I had was he times you (gives you 4 minutes for 15 questions,) that really kind of sucks. You can easily get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2005<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The BEST professor I've had for accounting.
