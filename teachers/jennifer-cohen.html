She provides the longest and most confusing assignment instructions which are close to impossible to understand. Constantly changes due dates after students complain about not understanding her instructions. She WILL NOT help you get placed in a school to observe unless it's Kenwood Academy.  Huge waste of my time. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2015<br>Class Name: SEC381<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Her focus is on classroom management, but she herself does not have much experience teaching high school students.  She's really flexible with students based on their needs. A lot of it was theory based, which is good to know but it was just a repeat of sec371. Same lesson plan assignments and everything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: TCH481<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Appeals to credibility by mentioning all the high schools she observes but she recycles her stories all the time - I call BS. Only thing she actually taught us was how to pass out a handout. 0 instruction besides this - thankfully the book was good. Had us revise learning objectives to fit her format (not Hansra's) with no explanation as to why</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: SEC364<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cohen is actually one of the most kind hearted professors that I've had in the program so far. Sit down and talk to her and you'll see why I say this. She has your best interest at heart and you'll learn more than you'll realize. I prefer when I learn more in class than via homework so I loved it. She helped me build my teaching portfolio</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2014<br>Class Name: SEC364<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Never stayed on topic. Never used the text book. Took forever to grade things. I didn't learn anything in this course that I didn't already learn in SEC 363. This class made me hate education. She should teach little kids, not college level courses. Avoid her at all costs. So knit-picky to the point of annoyance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: TCH320<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was ok. I felt at times that she tried to be strict but it came off more as lame. She NEVER stuck to the plan. We spent so much time just jerking about it's crazy. Would I ever take again? Hell to the NO. I'm pretty sure she thinks that she's a great teacher but she's not.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2012<br>Class Name: SEC364<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher ever. Really shouldnt be teaching people how to be teachers. I would probably write more but the comments below are pretty much right. No feedback, no plans. No organization.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2012<br>Class Name: TCH320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cohen was a great Professor. I was very interested in the readings that she assigned and the discussions that we had in class.  A class should be fueled by the students and their experiences, and that's what we did in our class. She is always willing to meet with you outside of class and listen to what you have to say about the class, reading, etc.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: SEC320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a fantastic individual! She lets the students fuel class.  Easy and gets you thinking...just what I was looking for in an Experimental Learning requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: TLAA<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was an online course that had to be taken during student teaching.  I didn't learn anything, rarely got feedback, and on Desire2Learn it said I had a 70/70 for points, but somehow I got a B+.  She also put the B+ in 2 hours before grades were due.  I don't even think she actually read the assignments we had to turn in. Stay away from Dr. Cohen</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2011<br>Class Name: SEC320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The person below me was in my class. We only read one book of the two she made us buy. She told us she'd give us feedback on our papers but never did. This class was a waste of my time and she should not be teaching. I have so much interest in the subject but ultimately she turned many people away from wanting to be teachers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2011<br>Class Name: SEC320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher was one of the worst I've had.  Some days she'd come in and have no plan.  On the other days, she would never stick to the 'plan' she wrote on the board.  We were told to buy 2 books and only read a few pages out of each.  We wrote 3 papers and never received them back or heard about them after we turned them in! Not recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: SEC364<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can tell she has never taught a day of high school in her life!

Even though there are pages of instructions to follow for assignments, no one knew what she wanted.  Unfair grader.  At times made class feel like a preschool classroom.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: SEC325<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cohen is horrible. Period. I cannot even get into the specifics because it brings about entirely too much pain. The above-mentioned instructor seems constitutionally incapable of attempting to provide value for our and our parent's tuition funds.  I can go further but will not due to a small bit of compassion for the woman that I cannot get rid of.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: TL405<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unclear regarding exactly what she expected out of final portfolio.  If she liked you, she made things easy for you, if she didn't or if you disagreed with her, she made things more difficult.  She was great at the start of the quitar, towards the end, she became rude and unapproachable. I wouldn't take her again if someone else was available.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/16/2006<br>Class Name: TL405<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bad news.

Although we did deviate from the syllabus at times, she would always clarify when something changed.  All you need to do is pay attention to her instruction and you're golden!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2006<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While I must agree that she is very confusing and unclear on what it is that she expects of students on assignments, she is an easy grader. If you speak up in class and ask questions, you will do just fine in the class. I didn't try too hard and got an A. I didn't find her intimidating at all, and though she was quite nice to talk to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2006<br>Class Name: EDU<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the comments below.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: TL405<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very intimidating...can respond harshly to students, actually made sarcastic remarks doing my class presentation (I couldn't get the overhead to work and she said something like, &quot;oh, yeah, those are skills you just might need if ur going 2 be a teacher&quot;). Avoid her at all costs!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2005<br>Class Name: EDU<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is the most heartless teacher I have ever met.

Getting through the written instructions on how to do a project is a project in itself.  I would avoid taking her unless you are very detail oriented and love talking in class.  It is a ton of reading and a lot of busywork.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: TL405<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2004<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While I think she has high expectations for her students, she is a fair grader.  There is a pretty large amount of work to do for her class, but if you do it all you will do fine.  If you approach her, she is more than willing to help.

We did nothing in her class, I mean nothing.  She assigned so many readings that we never discussed.  She also makes you feel like your opinion is not valid, only hers is.  Her portfolios are a pain to do.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2004<br>Class Name: MUS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Moves fast, but def helps when asked.
