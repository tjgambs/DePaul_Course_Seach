Lectures are informative and beneficial for an introductory course.  Feedback is fairly good, although it can be limited.  You will only receive help if you reach out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2014<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Choi gives great lectures with relevant material. Unlike many film professors, he does not dumb down the class for non-majors. He teaches at a pace that caters to those who really want to be in class and learning something useful about film structure. Assignments are a breeze as long as you pay attention in class and watch the films assigned. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2014<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really different then what I expected going in. You watch random, obscure films instead of big recognizable films. But overall, I enjoyed the films we watched because I would have never watched these films on my own and the teacher made the discussions interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2014<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this class. One of the best writing classes I've taken here. Prof Choi is a great teacher and really helpful. It was a fun class and I learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2014<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Watch some cool shorts and write a short screenplay. Pretty straight forward and easy. Choi was a great prof. Really breaks down the process for anyone to be able start writing screenplays. Work outside of class isn't too bad. I definitely recommend this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2014<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher who really helps you through the process of writing a screenplay. The class was really enjoyable. Manageable work load and overall a fun class. He also provides great real life experience in the field as a working filmmaker.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2014<br>Class Name: DC228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy clearly does not take his job very seriously. It's an easy A--which would be fine--but I'm not paying for an easy A, I'm paying to learn. He used a powerpoint throughout the entire class that he had clearly not made, and as a result his lectures were dry and flavorless.If you need an easy A, go for it. If you want to learn look elsewhere.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2014<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this guy's DC 201 as my 5th class in a 20 hour course load. Very consistent workload. MUST TAKE for kids looking for an online class to get bulk up their course load. It's interesting and the majority of the work is creative stuff. Not a great communicator but an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2013<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Great intro class. Very knowledgable about the film industry with lots of practical experience. He was very helpful with my screenplay and I learned a lot in the class. It's a manageable class even for someone with no previous writing experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: DC210<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows his stuff but he's dry as toast.... You really need to bug him to get him to communicate better with you. Overall a cool guy but uber boring! I still recommend taking Production 1 anyways</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2013<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not helpful, wish i had learned more</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2013<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class, easy, you get out of it what you want to, although I wish he taught a bit more, but good for an intro class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2012<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed his class and he was very helpful with my script.

Nice guy, his course is a la carte so you make of it what you want from it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy but doesn't really do anything. He would teach us at the end of class where the information would not be as helpful since we would be working on our project during the class time anyway. It's an easy class though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you desperately need an easy online class, take this! I warn you he is not very clear BUT he's an easy grader. I probably only watched 2 lectures the entire quarter and still got an A. You have to write a 15pg script, but don't be discouraged it's not like writing a paper, it's super easy! Plus you get like 3 weeks to work on it.</div></div></div></body></html>
