She was very accessible to talk to and develop your script. Still very involved in the business so her knowledge is relevant</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: DC224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kristyn is really kind and lenient.
