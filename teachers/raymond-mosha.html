I didn't know what to expect going into this course but I'm glad I took it. Every day I learned something about education and spirituality in Africa and about myself as well. Mosha's text along with the two others used during the course were very inspirational. This course is a must for educators, school administrators, or parents.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2013<br>Class Name: HC370<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a wonderful class for anyone who's interested in learning about spirituality and gaining insight into African culture. I'm majoring in early childhood education and this class is excellent for teachers. Mosha is a very caring instructor who really wants you to learn the material. Another book for this course is by Some and it is excellent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2011<br>Class Name: REL144<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A kind and gentle hearted guy.
