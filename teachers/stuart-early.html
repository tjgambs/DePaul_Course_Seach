I would take one of his classes again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: MGMT500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>can be long winded on go off on tangents but overall he is a decent teacher.  he brings real world experience from his background at best buy and gap which can be interesting.</div></div></div></body></html>
