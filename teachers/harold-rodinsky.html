This class was easy. I didn't read the book until the midterm/final and only skimmed and still got a 101%. He seems like his class will be hard and very extenuating when you see the syllabus however this is to weed out some of the students. His class is easy, laid back, and interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>psych has always been hard for me and his class was no exception.  his lectures were semi-helpful, but drifted off topic every now and then.  very scatter-brained but answers emails quickly.  funny guy and really nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's a cool guy although he talks about his cat. the class is very easy, just do the journals and pass the quizzes and your fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really great teacher! Easy quiz every week.  Really funny guy.  Incorperates the class a lot and does tell cat stories all the time.  Good about getting back to you through e-mail however, is horrible @ grading on time.  Didn't have a clear idea of my grade the entire class because of this.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME TEACHER! very laid back, talks about his cat a lot and random life stories. not a boring class! journals every Monday, quizzes every Fri but if u read, its an easy A! my final grade was a 96! hes also quite leniant about journals & such. I would highly recommend this professor to everyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2005<br>Class Name: ADOLESCENTPSY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree he is not for everyone.  Personally for me I do really like the man.  He was very helpful with giving me advice. There is a midterm and final. There is a final paper and time consuming journals each week. His stories make the class more interesting.  Sitting for three hours talking straight </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a good personality but gets off topic a lot. Quiz and journal every week. Quizzes are tricky but not impossible and he lacks telling you how to approppriately write a journal. Fun teacher but not very helpful. Final is everything after the midterm. Take him if you need to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he never answers questions and is sometimes just random n really weird</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>totally rude and doesn't know how to teach. this man is horrid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2005<br>Class Name: PSY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His moods varied but all in all a nice guy.

He's funny and nice if you act like you care and aren't sucking up to him.  Easy A but he is unclear sometimes.  Nice guy, great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>was not helpful at all in this course</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is great!

If you're looking for a non-stressful class, take this one with him, it'll be the least of your worries.  He's nice, easy, and really funny!  There is one journal due a week, and one quiz.  He also spreads out the grading scale evenly</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2004<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably my best teacher overall; he talks a lot about his cat though...With that aside, he's helped me tremondously, and is very accessible. He's more of a &quot;cool uncle&quot; kind of guy as opposed to a sterotypical teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2004<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very jolly guy, great lectures and he makes his class interesting. He's a little unorganized but still a good teacher. Quizzes are a little tricky but he's very understanding & gives you extra points if he feels that the questions were unfair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2004<br>Class Name: PSY300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! His discussions were insightful and tied in well with the material covered in the book. He is also good at getting back to you in person or by e-mail if you have any questions regarding any of the material. Quizzes weren't hard if youread</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2004<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE HAROLD!

The quizzes and tests contain tricky questions, that are often more confusing than they are challenging.  He's not entirely unreasonable though.  As a group, protest some of the &#63;'s.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2004<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not a lot of work, but study hard for the quizzes cuz if u dont your screwed. but other than that hes really nice</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2004<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's pretty cool. and he will help you if you need help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2004<br>Class Name: SENIORCAP<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Means well. Very disorganized, lectures are hard to follow. I learned mainly from the book.
