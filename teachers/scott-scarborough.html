    He's a good guy and knows his stuff. Sometimes not the best at explaining the material, but he has a TA who is EXTREMELY helpful. I'd take him again.

    Good class.  He explained the material well and helped me understand it as well.  His TA was great too.  The professor gave the lectures and the TA assisted in questions and held study sessions.  The midterm and final are not easy, but the sample questions and homework problems prepare you for them.  You do have to pay attention...it helps alot.

    Scarborough was a nice guy and the T.A. was very helpful.  Prof lectured every week.  We had 6 quizzes over handout problems.  If you do the handouts, you will do fine on the the quizzes.  He's good natured and will take time to answer your questions.  He gives two hw assignments, midterm, final and ex.credit opp.  Usually finished early (at night)

    I really liked this man, he is a nice guy and wants to make sure students understand the material. He is very busy though, so the TA does a lot and you'll probably end up asking him for help. All quizes and tests are based off the practice homeworks, do those and you'll be fine.

    This Professor was awful. He was terrible at explaining material, very boring, and very lazy.  The tests were hard and there was basically no homework to help you prepare.  If you asked for help outside of class he was rude and completely not helpful.  Stick with what you know Scott, be the CFO, but don't teach, because you are a miserable teacher.

    This professor is drop dead LAZY.... doesnt do anything... The grad assistant practically taught the class and he was 10X better than the professor.. he is the vp of operations @ depaul and assumes you know finance like he does.. His quizzes are definitely tricky, 5 choices!

    Great professor.  Has real world experience that helps you understand the material. He truly cares about your learning.   The class is tough and that is why students complain, but most finance professors have tough classes and don't explain material as well as he does.

    Im a straight A senior with a major in Finance.  Got a B- in this class.  Had to work my butt off, horrible teacher, will give you an ulcer.  Dont bother reading the book, doesnt help.  Quizzes/assignments are impossible.  If ur already screwed, go to Robert, the class T.A. he's what kept my sanity and helped me graduate

    More of an accounting class than a finance class taught by an accountant, not a finance professor.  Massive amount of painful readings, very little actual teaching besides reading off PPT slides, in-class problems are not helpful for taking quizzes/exams.  Nice guy, but bad course, bad instructor.

    Read from slides, the problems were not explained, he got confused himself how to explain them.  The quizzes were ridiculous, almost an hour, average very low for the class.  I felt like I had an accounting instead of Finance class.  Not helpful to the students. Waste of time and money.

    The class is not easy, especially the first part. The second part, though, gets better and more interesting. It's very helpful to have a good understanding of accounting before taking this class. The professor curves and might give you extra credits. Very useful information and knowlegable teacher.

    The worst professor and class I have encountered. Reading is excessive and not relevant; 1st paper analyzes a Not-for-profit (DePaul), a waste since most companies are for-profit; exams were a joke and quizzes were too detailed.  Prof had 70% attendance record, such a waste.  Avoid this professor!!!

    Great Professor. Complicated material, just study the slides and you'll be fine. Must be a dedicated student because this guy doesn't play. Second half of class is way easier.

    The material is not easy, but he does all he can to help you understand it.  Lots of &quot;real world&quot; experience, which is good.  First half of the class is much harder then the second.

    Not too difficult, but alot of reading.  Quizzes are pretty easy, but you do have to read your materials.  Never keeps you the full time.  Couple of papers and it helps if you have some accounting background.  Gives you the final exam questions.
