HOWEVER, this class is extremely difficult. I mean, it's a law class. Do not underestimate it. There is a curve for both midterm and final. They grade group presentations pretty easily. Go to the lectures and make sure you read. This class requires a lot of time management.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2013<br>Class Name: HSP207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Learned a lot in this class and everything is definitely applicable in the industry. The group project was a big help in understanding the legal concepts. Make sure you read in order to do well on the exams. Both are very nice professors.</div></div></div></body></html>
