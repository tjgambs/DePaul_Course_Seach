    Although Glen is nice and funny, this class seems to drag on for hours. I spend eighty  of the ninety minutes watching the clock.

    Carman was a great professor overall. There's homework due for every class but never too much, and it's always really clear what you need to know for a test. He has a delightful, goofy personality and he never expects you to do anything perfectly. Put a little effort in and you'll definitely get an A.

    Very helpful. He kept me awake at 9:40am with his fun, goofy personality. I learned a lot. He engaged the class. Even though he spoke almost entirely in Spanish during the quarter, he was able to find different ways of explaining the material so that everyone could understand.

    He is an okay teacher. Conquest of Mexico is not an easy topic the way he teaches it. The readings are long and boring and you HAVE TO read them. When discussing, he does not give you much feedback on what you say, there are papers, but if you read carefully you will be fine.

    phonology and phonetics: if you've never taken a class on phonology or phonetics, it's kinda hard. the book is wordy. though the class is interesting and it's nice to learn how to pronounce everything correctly and where differences derive from. talk to him if you need help.

    Had him for 102 and 103. He's a pretty easy professor but at the same time you learn a lot from the class. As long as you do the online hw and look over the vocab, you will be well prepared for the exams and the class will be an easy A. He usually gives partial credit for a lot of the mistakes on the exams.

    Glen Carman is great! I don't know what was wrong with some of the people who left bad ratings. I have had him for SPN and for HON and he was great in both, he's not boring at all, maybe some people don't understand his jokes. He also really knows what he is talking about. Take his class.

    He may not be the most interesting teacher, but I felt I learned a lot in his class. He definitely assigned a lot of work throughout the week, but he was always willing to explain things that may have been too difficult.

    He is not very hard but his grading is very unclear. He hands out a lot of worksheets and they are very helpful. Participation goes a long way but he makes you do ALL of the workbook pages!! This discouraged me from actually doing them and is not a smart idea. The tests are difficult if you don't study the workbooks.

    worst honors teacher i've ever had. makes me not want to be in the program anymore. terrible papers, no lectures, 100-200 pages per class session. expected to figure it all out on your own.  unreceptive to student complaints/concerns. seems to know a lot about the subject (conquest of mexico) but doesn't explain material well/make it interesting.

    Glen's a really rough grader, but he's an excellent teacher.  He expects you to do the work of the level (i.e. 100-level courses are much, much easier than 300-level ones).  He's also very understanding and patient with those whose Spanish is not quite as good as Heritage Speakers.

    He is very intelligent &amp; friendly.  He speaks slowly, so he is a good prof for those who have trouble understanding Spanish. This is an interesting class for spanish speakers/students - it will be beneficial! It is somewhat difficult, but worth the work!
