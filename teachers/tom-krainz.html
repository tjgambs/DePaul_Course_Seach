His lectures consist of him arguing a thesis statement, and arguing this thesis through the use of key terms that will help you remember salient points of the lectures. If you're a critical thinker and enjoy writing, you'll love him and this Women's History class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2014<br>Class Name: HST288<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Krainz always has the most intriguing lectures, you won't fall asleep. With that being said, take extensive notes. The exams are not easy but if you know your stuff you'll be fine. He is a hard grader, but fair. Read all the books, if you don't, you'll be sure to not do well. Take this professor, but don't expect an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2012<br>Class Name: LSP201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for Focal Point: Hurricane Katrina.  All in class discussions and papers are strictly on the books so read them.   Brings history to life and does well explaining everything.  Strict paper grader but will do anything to meet with you to go over outlines or rough drafts.  Very understanding.  Overall better class than what i expected.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2010<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor knows what he is talking about and brings history to life when he lectures. Makes the class very interesting. Assignments and tests are graded with great scrutiny. Take lots of notes during the lectures and read the assigned books.</div></div></div></body></html>
