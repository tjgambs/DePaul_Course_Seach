What are you all talking about.  I think considering that he barely gives you work that his grading is fair if you give it some effort.  All he makes you do is read his powerpoints and study those for exams.  How hard can that be!! SERIOUSLY!  Go to class, read a little, and pay attention.  Not rocket science!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: PSY334<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Adolescent psych with Cowman is fun! He's so laid back...and although he claims to be a hard grader on papers I haven't really had that experience. Take the class with Cowman. He's interesting, chill, and open-minded.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2007<br>Class Name: PSY101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A good guy but not a good teacher.  he just reads powerpoints everyday and makes it impossible to be interested.  take him if u want a boring but easy class. gives all the answers to the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I should have gotten an A in this class, but I did not.  It's easy, but the way he counts points is ridiculous.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2007<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome teacher! weekly quizes, essay midterm and multiple choice final (all the previous quizes are the final) you learn a lot in his class to! just show up despite the no attendance policy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2007<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, helpful...Take him!

His examples weren't very clear and it didn't seem like he even clearly knew the subject.  Having taken PSY106 before hand, I knew somethings that he couldn't remember or correctly remember!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2006<br>Class Name: PSY334<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shaun is a very relaxed but effective teacher. He gives an easy quiz once a week. There is not a final or a midterm. There are two papers and a final project. Very easy class! Take it! You will learn a lot in a laid back way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2006<br>Class Name: PSYCHOFMEN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't do it, if you want a college level class.  It's not that he wasn't prepared he had TONS of slides that he ripped off from various books.  Sure you don't have to buy a book or go to class but if you don't you're screwed, and if you go you're screwed too.  Class was boring, empty, and not very involved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2006<br>Class Name: PSYCHOFMEN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice and easy going guy.  No attendance policy.  The only issue I have with him are his scary speeches about grad school...it makes me never want to even try to apply to any!  Overall, if you get the chance, I would take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No attendence policy but its definately in your best interest to go to class. The night class is long and annoying but he often lets you go early. If you take the notes (which he will sometimes post on blackboard) then you are fine, you don't even have to do the reading. He's really laid back and the class really isn't hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2006<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I felt kinda bad for him b/c by the end of the 3hr class only about 5 people remained.He lets people leave early or not show up at all.Never takes attendance or makes a mental tally of who shows up.Doesnt learn names.This class is deceiving though b/c if u miss the notes, you'll be doomed. All the quizzes/exam come straight from 'em!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: PSC105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you dont understand the material than ask him about it. he is a very approachable guy and an overall good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No attendance policy, short quiz every week for points, midterm was a little more difficult than antcipated, but he gives you a list of questions to study from, and he will pick five from that list, final is the same way, very cool guy, very laid back and funny</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2005<br>Class Name: PSY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what these people are talking about!&#63;!&#63; Shaun is the rockstar professor of the psych department, he's anything but boring. He's smart, witty, and very clear in his slides and expectations. Not hard at all! Not in any way boring!!! (I don't know anyone who could be boring after THAT many cups of coffee!)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just making a comment to the person who had said if you fail one test it's all over.  That isnt true at all, I failed one test and didn't do too great on another and I still got a B in the class.  I really don't know what you are talking about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cowman is a high school drop-out who got his act together. Therefore he gives you no type of slack which he should especially considering that he is the most boring professor I have ever had. It was hell getting up in the morning to watch slides going by. YAWN...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shaun rocks! I have NO idea what the last reviewer was on when he came to class! Shaun is anything but monotone! He is a caffiene-driven incredible lecturer who puts a lot of energy into his class. He also is very smart, but not in a pompous, snotty, way. Come to class and you won't have to buy the book OR visa versa. A must!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: PSYCH105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He wasn't bad but he wasn't good either.  I found him so annoying with the whole Ferris Bueller thing. It is like SHUT UP your voice is soooo annoying!  I hated coming to clas cause the hour and half felt like forever! There is no attendence policy but I mean you still need to go.  Take it only if there is no one else teaching it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was interesting and Prof. Cowman used a lot of real world examples. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Cowman has no attendance policy, yay!!! But miss classes and ur screwed! He grades you on three tests and if you fail one, it's over! Think carefully before taking one of his classes!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WELL, he's kinda wierd, but I guess he;s unique in that sense- attendence most def. not required- just memorize text and get notes off blackboard and you should be fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2004<br>Class Name: ADOLESCENTPSYCH<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor! Very funny and great lecturer! Very wise, reminded me of a young Martin Crane (the father on Fraiser). My only complaint is that b/c he lives so far away, it was hard to get together with him to go over papers and quizzes, especially since I had a class right after his.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2004<br>Class Name: PSY334<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shaun rocks! He makes it easy to drag yourself out of bed at 8:30. He brings a great energy and wit to his lectures and uses real world problems to explain the concepts which makes it that much easier to understand. Take good notes and you won't even have to buy the book for an &quot;A&quot;!</div></div></div></body></html>
