I absolutely loved having him. It was my favorite class Autumn Quarter. He was so funny and very kind. He makes the best dad jokes. I wish he could teach every class of mine. Very personable and was very easy to work with. I cannot recommend him enough!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Funk is awesome! I loved this explore class and I really hope to be the TA for it next year.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: BIO191<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent lectures. He was engaging and knew the material well. Very receptive and helpful when I came to him with a concern.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2009<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rock Star -- hear he's president of faclty council too.

Definitely enjoys what he does and teaches.  Going to class is an option but without class you probably won't be able to pass.  Tests are difficult, but if you put enough studying in you'll do well.  And we made BEER! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2009<br>Class Name: BIO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funk was excellent. His tests are very fair, but studying is required. He posts his lecture notes on his website, though they aren't a good substitute for class. He's full of info about microbio, which makes this class really fun. Plus, he makes beer in the class that you get to try at the end of the quarter (if you're 21)! TAKE FUNK! He's great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2009<br>Class Name: BIO370<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As good as they come in biology.  Dr. Funk knows his material and has an infectious passion for science.  People who rate him probably struggled because they did not put forth the necessary effort.  This is college level biology folks who get what you put in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material learned in this class is relatively basic so it's easy to get an A. Funk does a good job, is clearly organized, and knows what he's doing. Personally, I recommend a laptop because the notes are extensive, but they also cover everything on the tests (reading the book still helps you understand the material though).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend Dr. Funk in a heartbeat.  He is one of the most knowledgeable professors that I had and never seems to have to dig deep for answers.  In class when the audio died during a video, he narrated the whole thing like it was nothing.  He is very well spoken, and he makes learning easy.  Lots of material in the class, so expect to study!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2008<br>Class Name: BIO307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests are all essays, which requires that you really know your stuff.  He is enthusiastic and works hard to get you interested.  He's a good teacher and will help you out of class without hesitation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher ever. i would recommend him to anyone!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2007<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a wannabe elitist, with a teaching style that shouldnt exist</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2007<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Dr. Funk. Yes he's tough and bio is hard work, but it's just to separate the dedicated students from the one's who aren't. Bio is one of those subjects that you have to LIKE in order to succeed. I would recommend him to everyone. Plus he's the pre-med advisor, so he was especially helpful to me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funk is a great teacher....all powerpoint presentations....and notes will be on blackboard. seems like he dosent know who u are but he does. u still gotta go to class cause a ton of the concepts need explaining. tests are challenging but online quizzes will boost ur grade. very clear and has the driest sense of humor....class is tough though!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2007<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this man is a speaking textbook but it is bio 101. very very boring. tests are straightforward. take brooke if you can</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, explains everything well, wont put anything on the test unless he went over it in class.

TAKE HIS CLAS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2006<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Funk is Funky!!

The only thing that makes him difficult is is kean attention to detail.  He gives multiple choice/ essay tests and on the essays you better memorize names exactly.  Hint** take the mutiplechoice quzzes on the book website..some model his questions</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2006<br>Class Name: BIO370<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Funk is very helpful and really intelligent. The tests are all essays, and you have to study a lot, but you cover everything on them in lecture. I did really well in this class because I put in the effort. He is willing to answer questions, and make use of the review sessions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2006<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, and he is down to earth.  He is willing to help if you need it, and he even responds to emails.  A must take for bio 101.  I dont know about any of his other classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2006<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Dr. Funk, and thought that he was great. He's also my advisor and definitely takes time to help me out and answer all of my questions. He's knowledgeable and sooo nice. He has a dry sense of humor that is great. Hes hard though, so make sure to study hard, but its definitely worth it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Funk is an awsome teacher. He has always responded to my emails and answered my questions. If you are pre-med, hes the advisor, so I would for sure go with him. I love his sense of humor and I look forward to taking more of his classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: BIO<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funk is unclear and has favorites, if you get on his bad side then he will put that upon your grade. Also, very forgetful and never replies to emails. Overall, don't get on his bad side because he will remember you for the worst. In addition, he is not funny at all, only tries to be.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2005<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures were great. Very detailed, clear and precise and basically covered everything on the test. You really didn't have to read if you went to lecture and paid attention. He teaches a science like it should be taught.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2005<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, but BORING lectures.  All notes are on powerpoint and he puts it up on blackboard so its easy to skip class now and then.  I went to class and didnt take notes, didnt read the book, and just studied for an hour before each test and got an A.  Good teacher, just pretty boring lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2005<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy is nice. But the class itself has to cover ALOT of material, so he has to speed through that stuff. And you have to keep up. Make sure to get the readings done, or at least use that CD that comes with it. I got sleepy during lectures, but that's probably b/c of the warm room and comfy seats.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2005<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Funk is helpful and approachable in lab, and genuinely cares about his students' progress.  Lecture, however, is difficult to follow because he only reads off powerpoint.  The class is tough and requires a LOT of self-teaching outside of class.  Funk's dry sense of humor is great</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2004<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bio is hard, but Dr. Funk is good at teaching it.  He's funny as hell and is always willing to help.   Despite his level of education and his importance in the scientific community, he's a really down-to-earth guy who is very approachable and easy to talk to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard topic but he's willing to help with questions you might have.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2004<br>Class Name: BIO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Funk is hard teacher but very helpful and enthusiastic.

He gives study guides but half of what u need to study is not on the exams,so u end up studyin so much material for nothing. Tests are weighed very heavy! though they are not extremly hard. He basically reads off his power pt presentations,very hard to stay awake.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2004<br>Class Name: MICROBIOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was the easiest claa i've ever taken at depaul. i highly recommend taking cell bio with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2004<br>Class Name: BIO107<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a horrible teacher.  He expects you to know just as much as he does.  The worst part about the class is his exams- the class average was 57%.  Just doesnt take time to explain anything.  Get another professor quick!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2004<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It seems as though Funk tries his hardest to teach this tough course, but trust me there are better professors out there that can help you through this course rather than Dr.Funk. He seems as though he's in his own world when hes teaching, not allowing us to grasp the concepts</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yea...hes a pretty hard grader, but I think thats more the course then him specifically. He tries his best which is good.  Also, if you need help, he'll be more than willing to help and answer questions. Its just a really hard class in general unfortunately</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2004<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2004<br>Class Name: BIO<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, he is really hard. He pretty much just reads the power point and thats it. Yes he gave us a study guide but it really doesnt help. Basically you have to teach yourself. Read it and study yourself. Powerpoint does not really help.Wouldn't reccommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I TRIED TO BE AWAKE, HE MUBLES ALOT, BUT HE PUTS WORK ON POWERPOINT INCASE YOU MISS CLASS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2004<br>Class Name: BIO101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard course (I assume all biology teachers to be hard)Dr. Funk seemed to just read his lectures, and not quite explain.
