I really liked him: he was helpful, knowledgable, and fun! All the crap that you wrote guys is bs.

Instead of spending class time showing examples of problems that will be for homework and on quizzez, he copies down crappy notes with zero enthusiasm and makes up shi*ty examples that will never appear on any Test or Quiz. The Text Book does a better job of teaching the material don't waste time listening to Mikhail just read the text</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: MTH262<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lecture format approach an equivalence of a vocalized catatonic zombie trance by merit of the format.  No enthusiasm is exhibited at all.    Don't take at night, you will fall asleep.</div></div></div></body></html>
