His love for the subject is really clear. Getting a good grade is pretty easy. Tons of reading but it's great material. Also easy to skim and know what you're doing. Corny jokes but if you have a good-natured class everyone learns to love them. Also does a great Stalin impersonation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2011<br>Class Name: HST249<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A bit monotonous voice-wise but super entertaining. I loved the class, even if his voice did put me to sleep regularly. Great cheesy jokes and really knowledgeable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2006<br>Class Name: SEVERAL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very dull and boring and not very helpful outside the classroom...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2005<br>Class Name: HSTINTEL20TH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>excellent well informed teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2005<br>Class Name: COLDWAR<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took his class Spring quarter & I ask myself why this man cant loosen up.When it got warm out he went into a dull drawn out speech about something that occurred to him in college to why he didnt like being outside for class(what did that have to do with going outside for class).Good teacher, but really anal retentive at times which got annoying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2005<br>Class Name: HIST<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class.  It's disturbing to hear from a scholar that the BeeGees are hip and ELO Styxx and Journey are boss.  But it's a history class and it was worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2005<br>Class Name: HST320<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's got a great knowledge of things, but his humor is rather dry and lame. He can be somewhat anal retentive about things and he has a habit of going over the alloted time for class and not dismissing when the class is supposed to end by the posted schedule.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: SSC395<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A Great instructor who knows his stuff. Seems like he's spent all his life learning about Churchill and the European eras. Grades ok but if he doesn't like you, you're gone. Papers can be hard and VERY lengthy but in the end, if you do your part, you're getting a A-. He never gives an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2004<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2004<br>Class Name: HISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. B is the best professor I have ever had.  He is challenging, thought provoking, and  very wise.  I think your average college kid is scared of him becuase he actually makes you think!
