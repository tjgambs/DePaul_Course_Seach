There are on average 3 quizzes  a week but they are pretty simple, testing your general knowledge (which you learn in class) than giving you hard problems.  She does not try to trick you, which is great! I look forward to the class each week!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2015<br>Class Name: 147<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whenever Dr. tenner teaches, it rains puppies... in heaven. Dr. tenner cannot be cloned, because that will require unicorn horns. And the reason there is a sunrise, is because Dr. tenner is teaching math to someone. She is one of the best professors you will ever encounter. She responds to emails even on sundays and takes time to explain material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2014<br>Class Name: 147149<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tenner is very nice.

Really nice, she can actually lecture like a boss, which is a super rare and fantastic quality. She teaches hard stuff, so you really have to do the work, and do it ahead of time, but she will always take time out of her day to help you out.  Such a cool person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2012<br>Class Name: MAT261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>do your hw (not only the ones to turn in), come to class, pay attention, and you're set. she's nice and clear in explanations. best math prof i've had by far!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2012<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DePaul is a great school because of teachers like her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2012<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a nice teacher! I absolutely hate math, and struggle with it. She is so good at explaining things and you can see she really enjoys math, she was a math major. She really wants you to do well and will help you if you have questions. Great teacher take her if you can!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2011<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall great teacher. Doing ALL the homework and well on the weekly exams are very important.She will help during office hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>honestly, i would say prof tenner was a great teacher! i learned alot from her course and if you simply do the assigned work and pay attention in class, there's no way you can't get AT LEAST a B! trust me, i'm horrible at math and i found i actually did well in a math course for once.. mainly because she is very clear when teaching lessons!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: MTH100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class isn't necessarily difficult, but there is a lot to do.  Online quizzes and homework every few days that don't seem to correlate with the material she teaches in class.  She doesn't really engage the class so resorts to calling people out.   She's a nice lady, but definitely needs to be teaching elementary and middle school kids.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2011<br>Class Name: MAT110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I came into class everyday nervous. She can be nice, but she is intimidating and not so approachable. There were days when I wanted to drop out her class, but she is only making us put in the extra effort to be successful. 50/50 on recommending her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: MAT110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, I thought this will be blow off class since it was Math for Elementary Education teachers, but I was completely wrong. She was so vague when it comes to answering question and was very rude. She was not approachable nor helpful. Please don't take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2009<br>Class Name: MAT111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sheis REALLY nice and she cares about your grade and that you understand the material.  She can be intimidating at times and can seem stand offish but if you can get over that she is really helpful.  Also, there is a an open note homework quiz every Thursday where you litterally copy your answers so its easy points IF you have your homework done!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2009<br>Class Name: MAT302<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Combinatorics with professor Tenner was amazing.  She really really knows this material, and does everything she can to help.  Her class is interesting because she gives a lot of examples, and gets everyone to participate.  Her quizzes and grades are so fair.  As long as you work hard you'll be great, and even have a good time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a decent teacher, though she can be a bit confusing at times, and a little difficult to approach with homework, since she's not very willing to help, mostly she just kind of nudges you in the right direction, and expects you to go from there. Not the worst math teacher I've ever had, but not the best either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2008<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She tries really hard to be a good teacher but she has a condescending and extremely rude attitude towards her students that gets in the way of her success as an approachable professor. There were times when I was really shocked at the unnecessarily rude tone she used with us. Overall though, just do the homework and you'll be fine in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher but Sometimes rude-seems to get annoyed when ppl. don't get what she's teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2008<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Tenner is great.  She likes the subject and seems to genuinely hope for her students' success.  Math isn't easy, so you have to do your homework.  There is no way to fake it. The good news is that she isn't there to trick you.  Easy midterm if you know your stuff.  Don't expect an easy &quot;A&quot; but she does her part to ensure you understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a decent teacher but gives a lot homework has no curve at all. She also tends to treat us as if we are in seventh grade. Her test are very highly waited final is 35% of your grade. Find a professor that leaves out the hours of homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>boring professor, but nice at the same time and does want her students to succede. at times is rude.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2007<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best math teachers I have ever had. She is very straightforward and fair. Material on the tests and quizzes is always covered in class and she is very knowledgeable and interested in what she teaches. I can't rate her highly enough.</div></div></div></body></html>
