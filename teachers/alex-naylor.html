He rambles on with sparse dry humor - not enough to keep me awake. Honestly, I didn't really learn anything from his class. He uses very outdated videosreadings, and most of the things we discussed weren't relevant in today's society. Tough paper grader, overall easy A for me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never gotten such mean and degrading comments on a paper. Absolutely ridiculous for a professor. One of his comments was "wow, this is one of the first correct interpretation you've actually made" and I knew he was just  being mean because all his other comments were like "THIS IS INCORRECT" Tough grader too, I don't recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is one of the harshest graders i've ever had. His comments are useless for improvement, and only show what was wrong. The assignments are unclear and he will give you a poor grade regardless of the fact his assignments are confusing and lack clarity.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Vey passionate about his job. His sense of humor was so strange yet enjoyable. I liked how the 9 short responses were mostly based on opinion which were discussed in class. If you put in effort on the essays, you will do well. His commentary may be a bit unclear but he is always available to discuss your writing after class and during office hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expect to complete 9 short writing assignments, and three essays. Also expect to get very little feedback on your writing, and to encounter general vagueness about grading policy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Naylor was unfair and vague with his gradings, and his classes were very monotonous. Naylor is unclear with what he wants out of the assignments, and struggles when trying to teach the class.  Don't take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of these reviews focus on how funny and sweet he can be, but when it comes to grades, he is a real stickler. He will take a point off anywhere he can. This is mostly because he takes his job very seriously, which is good, but BE AWARE of this. He may be funny and cute but unless you prove to be true writer, you'll only be able to manage a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Naylor's class was really enjoyable if on the hard side since while it is not hard to get a B its really hard to get an A but he is a really nice guy and cares about his job.  If you work hard you will get a good grade. Also  he can be unclear at times making some assignments harder than they should be.  Overall though I enjoyed WRD 103.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Moderately tough grader but very helpful and accessible.  He truly cares about what he does and will help you do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Naylor is so sweet! He is funny in a goofy way and truly cares about what he teaches. His assignments are clear and easy as long as you take the time needed on them, and he makes himself very available if you need help. Although most lectures were boring he is still great. Would definitely recommend him/take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Naylor is an okay teacher. I highly recommend that if you take him expect to be in for a grammar checker. He loves what he does therefore he checks your papers for grammatical and format errors. This means that when you turn in a rough draft it should be close to perfect. This is going to be the difference between an A and an A-.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is adorable and grows on you after a while. He really makes an effort to get people involved and help them succeed. If you do your work and come prepared to class, you'll breeze through it. He gives you plenty of time to get things done. He can be long winded, but he tries to make things fun and interesting. I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was an okay teacher. He jokes around a lot which is pretty funny, but the essays are pretty easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He can not teach at all. Lectures were always boring, really hard grader on papers! Doesnt leave comments on what you need to fix, but does offer a lot of help if students need it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Naylor likes to make the class fun, and definitely enjoys what he does.  The papers aren't incredibly difficult, and he's always prepared to help you out outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very adorable teacher I felt like adopting him as my grandpa BUT a harsh grader. Does not leave comments on papers about what can be improved however he does provide a lot of help to you prior to turning in the final paper. I wouldn't take him again, but I'm sure many people in my class would.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first, he seems difficult and dull, but afterawhile he can grow on you.  He is funny and rather nice.  Assigns a lot of work but makes his expectations clear.  If you do what he asks you to do (he specifically states in his assignments what he's looking for) then you should easily do well in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's so chill and he really loves what he does. He's also a goof ball and likes to make jokes. We didnt take one test all we had were papers and only 4 so thats not bad at all for the whole quarter! Take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Naylor is so awesome!  He absolutely loves what he teaches and makes you enthusiastic about it too! He is very funny and makes the classes interesting.  Most times the class is over before you know it (no counting down the minutes!)  He makes himself very approachable and accessible for questions and conferences.  I reccommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a funny little old man that tries to be hip and understanding. He assigns papers every two weeks so if you don't like writing and don't to well of a job don't take this class. He gave trips and enjoyable subjects to write about. I'd take this class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked Mr. Naylor. He didn't grade hard. Not all classes were madatory. If you dont like writing papers then don't take becuase that is all you do in this class. I found most of them except for the final and one on a museum to be pretty interesting to write about. He also offers to edit your rough drafts! awesome professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>love this class! such a helpful old man. grades pretty easy, and if you ask for help, he will look over it for you and give you advice on how to make it better. take his advice because it will make your essay better. You are constantly doing an essay, its one after another, and percentage gets higher and higher. It will start out at 10 percent</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice, very energetic.

He'd annoy me sometimes though because he'd give you a reading assignment and then the whole next class period would be him rereading it. He sometimes contradicts what he wants in a paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE is so funny, so energetic, and so insightful.

He realy wants you to be a strong writer and he's very helpful you can't go wrong with him. The readings and assignments aren't hard he gives people a lot of lee way and the man offered his home number because he didn't have e-mail. how helpful is that. Really good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great guy and always will to work with you even when you have an assignment overdue or what not!!

His material is not hard but not mindlessly boring either and he is always there to help.

If you work hard, though, he takes that into account.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this guy! He is such a good guy and very nice.  He will help you at anytime and will help you with your grade also if he likes you. Just boring during class but lets you out early. BEST TEACHER BY FAR!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Naylor was probably the greatest teacher I will ever have. His assignments challenged the mind and stayed true to the spirit of going to a University. Not only was the class helpful, but the fact that he would talk to a circut breaker on the wall always kept you on your toes. God Bless that man... and may he always be in our hearts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE'S CRAZY! He's a little weird but easy. Any reading for hw you go over in detail the next class. You hand in rough drafts which he grades then the final paper. That makes it easy to get an A. I would recommend him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very nice, and helpful, but a bit boring.

He would just read the hmwk from the previous night. Would take off points for being absent. Horrible teacher. Will definitely not take him again. He was a very hard grader on all papers.

All these people are right though, he is weird - but in a histerical way.  Anxious to give help with papers (lets you call him @ home) and easy grader if he sees you are trying.

Cute b/c he's old and not up to date. (he really did talk to the wall for some reason! lol) He really had interesting and insightful topics for us to think about, but lectures tended to get boring.

He talks down to students, even those who know they are smarter than him. He teaches like a high school teacher(ie. boring lectures and heavy attendance taking). He tries, but if you are easily annoyed, he will drive you nuts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such a cute man and he is really concerned about his students and their grades, he even gave out his home phone so we could call him with questions.

We all suspected that he is on something because he would randomly walk over to the corner and talk to the walls. He admitted he used to be a hippie. The class was easy.
