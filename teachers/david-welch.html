He was pretty fair in grading everything except participation points for me, as I contributed every class and still got a B in that area. Good overall though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2012<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful poet, and a generally fun professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2012<br>Class Name: SPIES219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>[Spy Literature Class] There will be a LOT of reading in his Spy lit class. its very interesting and his lectures are very useful and help give you a preview of EXACTLY what he wants in your work so pay attention. Due to the large amounts of reading there are very few other assignments so go to class and make sure you do them well and on time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took his focal point class about spy fiction and as long as you don't play sports or have a job outside this class you'll be fine. Be prepared to read one full novel per week and then have a alarmingly specific quiz every class period. David is extremely helpful outside of class however and he is a VERY smart guy. (He'll butcher your own writing)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2012<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wonderful. a writer's professor. if you are serious about writing well then listen to his lectures (the necessary and seemingly unnecessary), read what is given to you, maintain eye contact, and ask questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2011<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think people are just bitter toward David as they don't want to work that hard. I was always able to get straight A's in school with BS work...no such luck here. He's too sharp; he always saw through it and challenged me. Lots of folks complained about him cause he didn't give easy A's in Spy Lit..god forbid you learn something in college, right&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2011<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a knowledgeable guy, undoubtedly, but he is incredibly arrogant given that his creative work consists of a few poems. He is very much your prototypical hipster professor, so if that's what your after take his class by all means. I love to write, and he made me hate it a little bit. I'm not a huge fan, much better professors at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2011<br>Class Name: ENG484<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is extremely arrogant. The materials he assigned us to read for creative writing were useless. They were so abstract. He felt overall if you didn't write in his style that you were not a good writer. I don't recommend his classes.I've had way better writing classes.In fact,this was the worst writing class of my entire professional writing career</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I definitely recommend taking a class by D. Welch if you are interested in creative writing. He is very knowledgeable and challenges your writing. However, some people finds his lectures rant-like and useless. Not true. He's got some good stuff to say. Take him seriously, I have a feeling a lot of people take his class b/c he's attractive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2011<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Golly, I still don't know how to take this dude.  He's really cute and has a fairly fun class (as in, he has a sense of humor and enjoys what he does), but he's kind of arrogant!  I'd still recommend him in comparison to other professors, though.  Good guy, I think&#63;  Great taste in lit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>David is an amazing professor had him a yr ago. If you ask he is willing to help you in every way possible. He takes out the extra time to find authors and poets that match your style, and makes you feel like you have the potential to become a great writer. He is serious about his class and attendance, and if you are too you will learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like to write, take the class.  If not, don't take the class.  Professor may be...a little arrogant...but he sure is cute.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2009<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of my favorite professors, I hope I have the opportunity to take him again. He's EXTREMELY helpful to students, all you have to do is ask. He is willing to put extra effort to helping a student understand whatever they are having an issue with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/04/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed David's class.  Some sessions seemed like they had no point to what we were supposed to be learning but he always eventually made everything connect. I loved how he was interested in his students opinions in class. The readings were long but skimming can get you by. He is willing to help unless the paper is due in under 24 hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE! He graded the papers so so hard.  I have never had such a horrible experience in writing.  He made us read the most pointless stories that didn't even affect our grade.  We spent the entire quarter developing our paper, and he checked over my rough draft, and I made the corrections he suggested and he gave me a C! RUDE!Don't take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2009<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Writing exercises are interesting, and his feedback includes helpful, detailed comments. Attendance is very necessary for his class, and he gets a tad cranky if you're late. Not a difficult class unless you skip class or don't turn assignments in. Also, on a side note: this professor makes for some distracting eye candy ;)</div></div></div></body></html>
