    She made the course uninteresting and bland. Would not recommend. Is too quite and incomprehensible. Overall, class was a blow-off, easy A though.

    Taghrid moves at an easy pace. She is pretty funny, but kind of quiet. I'd recommend her.

    The class was pretty easy,but  by the first week you'll want to hit your head against a brick wall. She explains things in a way that is easy to follow, but when she answers the same questions over and over to that one students that &quot;just&quot; can't get it the simply but time consuming activities will get on your nerves. Bring a pillow and blanket.

    Great professor, very helpful. Provides a very straight forward approach to the material. No projects, just short homework and in class assignments. Midterm and Final were easy. No one should have a problem doing well in this class.

    I hated this class but I loved Taghrid. She is so cute and helpful. Knowing that she was always going to be helpful and grade you fairly made suffering through a class completely uninteresting to me tolerable.
