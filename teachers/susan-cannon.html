She does not deserve your time and money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a difficult class and she does not make it easier. She has difficulty explaining the material and is very unclear on the subject matter. The midterm and final are very difficult. I would definately not take her again. This is a class where you have to do the homework or you are screwed</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible!! Worst professor I have ever had in my 4 years.She didn't teach a thing and gave the hardest tests possible.This lady can't teach and I would strongly advise not taking her.I learned more about real estate in a 3 month internship than I did in this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very bad teacher! She gives way too much material on tests for allotted time to take it.  I knew all the material, but couldn't finish the test (15 pages).  Don't take her if you don't have to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her but agree that her test are hard and her lectures have nothing to do with the class but it does keep you awake...talks about Texas a lot...attendance counts.
