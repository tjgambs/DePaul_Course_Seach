    I loved Dan! He doesn't waste time with dull lectures and challenged us constantly with practical examples. He's a great professor and an incredible resource. Super nice guy and no b.s. whatsoever. I highly recommend him for grad students especially. Wish he taught more than one grad course!

    I loved going to his Advertising class. He's super funny and frequently makes things relevant for his students. The book is pointless to get. I never opened it once. I can't think of anything wrong with him!

    Love Professor Windels! He's super straight forward and personable. Go to class, read your notes and you'll do fine.

    Professor Windels has a great sense of humor and he is very approachable.  Even if you dislike the material, his delivery makes it very easy to digest and it draws your attention.  However, if you do not like group projects do not take this professor.  He weighs them very heavily and if you are paired with a few bad-seeds your grade may suffer.
