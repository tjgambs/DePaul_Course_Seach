Assignments are unclear and if you ask her, she doesn't make them any clearer for you. The reading is tedious and though perhaps interesting at first, quickly gets boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's generally unfriendly and flips out at people randomly. Time consuming course since you have to visit your cafe regularly. I'm actually interested in coffee/cafes but found the course and most of the reading to be a bit monotonous. Does not communicate well in regards to grades on assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She may be knowledgeable and all, but she doesn't like to share it in a way that will help her students learn or grow. The knowledge she shares is about herself. Much of the work that was done will probably never help you in life. Coffee&#63; Really&#63; There really shouldn't be a class focused on this. There are more important things in life than coffee.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nagy is by far the worst professor I have ever encountered.  Believe me, do not waste your time on the Coffee Class. It was a complete joke and that woman is in love with herself. No joke.  She is not only miserable with her pathetic existance but is passive aggressive to the point of disgust.  Save yourself the trouble and avoid her at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nagy literally cares about no one else or how her students do in her class.  I honestly think that she grades based on her favorites in the class, if you can call anyone a favorite.  She's absolutely no help if you have ANY questions. Don't take her if you care about your grades/gpa.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She only likes to her self speak and  has very little interest in others' opinions.  She chooses favorites which makes the class frustrating and boring.  She was indifferent when she sent my group to a cafe that she had not bothered to look into and did not know they did not exist anymore. A ton of reading, not worth the credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2007<br>Class Name: ANT203<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a good teacher--definitely very knowledgable. I think she makes class very interesting and challenges us. She encourages us to go visit her during office hours. Only bad thing, for me, is that she's not very personable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Where do I start&#63; How about ****,  doesn't care about students, completly biased grading... I could go on and on. Point blank by far the most horrible teacher I have ever had in my life. I learned very little, I did all the work gave the class my all, and she treated me like I was simply wasting her time. NEVER TAKE HER CLASS!! TRUST ME!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you are taking her for the coffee class then be prepared to read a lot! the material is pretty interesting, but if you are not into anthropology, then you will prob end up getting very annnoyed. if you like anthro, then Nagy is for u, she knows what se is talking about. this class was not what i expected, but it wasnt bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2006<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's good ! i like the way she teached us and her exam review sheet before the exam is very2 helpful.. i guess if people really concentrate in her class then they shouldn't be having any trouble at all to get a good grades</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst professor that I have had since I began at DePaul.  She is an unfair grader and loves to hear herself speak.  She will cut people off midsentence and tell them to stop talking even if you haven't said anything all class.  That happened to like 6 or 7 people in my class.  She is just plain aweful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2006<br>Class Name: ANT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not waste DePaul's expensive tuition on this teacher. I don't know why she still teaches. She says herself that she doesn't like teaching. So do her a favor and do not take her classes. Even if you put effort into her class and attend her boring lectures, she will find something to complain about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stear clear of this one. She takes things very personally and is an inconsistant grader, especially because her assignments are not specific. She also gets mad when people in the class don't know about particular musicians.  Not an exciting or interesting teacher but expects you to respond as if she is.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did not enjoy this professor. She does not seem open and is looking for very specific answers to her questions all the time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really nice and obviously passionate about her research (and cultural anthro. in general). Her exams aren't necessarily easy, but she provides practice tests with the exact multiple choice questions that will be on the exam. She also lets you know what to study for the short answer/essay section. Helpful, etc.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nagy rocks my world. She knows her sh*t, and you will learn so much from her. Talk in class, she will &lt;3 u... and because youre a loser if you dont anyways. I am pre med, with no real initial interest in anthropology... until now.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: ANT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a good teacher, but her tests are kinda hard. you have to study to do well. homework is reading, and it is interesting. class is mostly discussion, which is nice. come to class prepared to talk about the readings and your opinions, and you will have a good time in this class. warnig: dont miss class or come in late.you willget onher badside</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2004<br>Class Name: ANT320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have nothing but the best to say about her.  She is wonderful.  Make sure you do your work...all of it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes class fun but shes still a tough teach. She doesnt tolerate any bull. She generally knows what shes talking about and is willing to help you if you sincerly need it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2004<br>Class Name: ANT320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman really knows her stuff and is clearly very intelligent. She will not hold back from humiliating a student who has not done his homework, however. Great at incorporating her knowledge into class discussions but sometimes classes poorly organized</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2004<br>Class Name: ISPSSMW<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>bs class--- she knows what she is talking about but i feel like im a little kid--- she is super nice and super understanding but doesnt let you walk all over her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is an unfair grader and plays favorites.  the class i took was about coffee and she made it into something rediculous.  i suggest not to take her for focal point or her anthropology classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nagy is a very arrogant person, with a condesending attitude towards students.  This freshman course is supposed to aclimate a new student to a university by making learning fun and not too challenging like the other ISP courses taught here.</div></div></div></body></html>
