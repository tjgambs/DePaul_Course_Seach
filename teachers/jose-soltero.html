Two are on novels, easy.  The other two are considered "exams" and are harder. He gives very long lectures but is hilarious, he understands that night classes are long.  Good guy. Textbook reading optional, use for exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2014<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sociology is my minor, so I have a natural interest in this subject. If you don't want to make the effort, and expect a good grade this isn't the class for you. Fantastic teacher. His humor throughout classes keeps me engaged, his communication skills in simplifying or explaining concepts is awesome. Plus his accent is entertaining.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2014<br>Class Name: SOC358<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is incredibly smart and an abysmal communicator. His syllabus is nonsense (it is only a list of things to read; no dates, no times). His pickiness in all things is absurd and uncalled for. His grading system is archaic and he sets his students up to fail with the way he grades: 40% paper 1, 40% paper 2, 10% presentation, 10% bibliography.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: LST300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Peasant Rebellion was a great class.  But i felt that he was more worried about ASA format than the actual materials when writing the essays. I did not like the fact that he does not give us the access to D2L, for at least the roster, since he will not reply to questions. We should at least have access to each other. Interesting class though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: INT360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Peasant Rebellions will probably be the best class you will ever take at DePaul, which is why it fills up so quickly. Soltero is friendly, engaging, funny, and extremely knowledgeable. The amount of history he knows is truly incredible. One of the best professors and one of the best classes at DePaul. Can't recommend him enough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has been my favorite soc professor so far. He relates theories to modern day problems. Pay attention and just know that he loves when you use modern examples. If you come to him in his office hours and show interest and curiosity he truly appreciates it. just communicate with him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: SOC358<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a cool guy but he states in the email that he will not respond to emails, he needs to get with the times/program. The papers are hard and he is picky about APA ASA format. Make sure to pay attention and take notes to his lecture only class. He's knowledgeable but he does not communicate through technology.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are a student that truly cares about sociology, then take this class.  You must read everything assigned, and be sure to take notes!  He is extremely helpful and cares about you as a student.  Also, I give him several chile peppers and his accent is delicious!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2010<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really nice but he does seem to be pretty strict. The only homework in the class is weekly readings, which are hard to understand but he explains them to you in class. Don't miss any of the classes and make sure you participate a lot because he really likes that. There is a midterm and final as well as a paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2010<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the funniest professors at DePaul.  Always keeps the interested whether talking about the material or going on a tangent about what he did over the weekend.  Only teaches night classes, so his class is ideal for the working student. Easy grader- gives specific intsructions on what topics to focus on for the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2010<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor. I took a night class with him and he was able to keep it interesting the entire time. He's not a super easy grader but not to hard either. The only problem is that most of you grade comes from assignments that you don't get back at the end of the quarter so if you don't do well there is no way to make up for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2010<br>Class Name: SOC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2010<br>Class Name: SOCMANY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is GREAT.

If you haven't taken his Revolutions class, I really recommend it.
