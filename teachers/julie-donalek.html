I had no background in nutrition so the course was a little more difficult for me. The midterm and final are decently difficult, but she makes up for it with generous grading on the paper. Other than that, no homework. Very helpful in and out of class. I give her a 9/10.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2007<br>Class Name: NSG200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. D is AWESOME- She is funny and knows so much about nutrition.  The class is great if you do the work- readings every night and class is lecture based.  Multiple choice midterm and final, as well as a research proposal project.  She is extremely helpful and full of great information.  Take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2007<br>Class Name: NSG200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher.
