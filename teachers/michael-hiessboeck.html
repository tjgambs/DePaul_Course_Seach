His tests are so easy as long as you study for about an hour or two. The papers were somewhat long but not difficult. He was always willing to help which is good because his assignments were often unclear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2012<br>Class Name: GAM208<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Meh... the title of the class sounded exciting, but his method of style didn't make the class that enjoyable. Not hard at all, but a lot of reading to do in a short amount of time. His Austrian accent might be hard for some people to get past, but he's understandable for the most part. Wouldn't recommend his class though.</div></div></div></body></html>
