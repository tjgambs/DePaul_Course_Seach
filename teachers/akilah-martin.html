She offers little to no guidance on major projects. For example two poorly written sentences to explain an entire presentation that one doesn't even find out is supposed to be a large power point presentation until they look at her attached grading rubric. Avoid taking her classes. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2014<br>Class Name: SW231<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: P</div><div id="right"><div>Kind soil lover. Work load is moderate. Lenient but unclear. Beware, she says something one week & completely different the next. Lectures cover very broad topics that only expose you to the science maybe because its an SNL course. All assignments & experiments are online from other universities. Teaching may not be her strong suit.</div></div></div></body></html>
