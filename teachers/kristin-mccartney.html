She genuinely cares about her students and is so nice. She prepares students for the final, midterm, and paper more than any other professor I have had. No textbook. Attendance is mandatory, but it's worth going.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2014<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Issues in Gender and Sexuality is a must take with her! She is amazing. Fair grader, keeps you interested and picks relevant articles. No textbook. Midterm, final, and paper. Would love to take another class with her anytime! Take her for anything! I learned a lot and enjoyed this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: PAX200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  Was very knowledgeable about the subject and very passionate about it. She is a very fair grader and is always available to answer any questions you have</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2013<br>Class Name: HUM131<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great instructor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2012<br>Class Name: PHL250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kristin is an exceptional instructor. I can safely say that I have learned more from her class than any other class in my college career. We discussed very heavy topics and sometimes had very heated class discussions, but our classroom never ceased to be a safe space where we felt comfortable. Our class ended up bonding. Take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2012<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher, well rounded coursework, great selection of required readings. Very cool and understanding with her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: PHL250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kristin was amazing. By far my favorite professor at DePaul. She offers her students different ways of viewing the world and is able to put all that we read in class into context. I took a lot from the class and am a better person for it. I reccommend her highly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2010<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well I took her for Postcolonialism, she is very liberal. She teaches mainly communism but it does spread to other forms of government, because of the book. You have to read and there are daily exercises that are pretty simple and are based on the readings. No quizzes, tests, or final tests. Just a final paper. Not recommended for conservatives.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor McCartney is a very liberal and open minded teacher. Conversations about sex, and marijuana were often discussed. She tried very hard to get the whole class to get in on the discussions, but alas only a quarter of the class would ever talk. She keeps the class interesting and challenges us to prove our own points or opinions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2010<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kristen is a young and fun prof. She is a very easy grader and actually allows you to grade a lot of your own work. Basically in this class we watched a lot of movies outside of class and then talked about them during class. The grades cam mostly from class discussion, so speak up, and our final paper. Nothing in this class is significantly hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2010<br>Class Name: PHL231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her for Race and Philosophy and it's one of the best classes that I've had at DePaul. She's willing to help students and very approachable. She's not one to coddle so have on your big kid undies before you take her class. She doesn't hold hands but is willing to aid in your success.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her Visible Identities course for LSP. Tough and challenging textbook, but I did learn a lot through the process. She is very willing to help you excel and is there to help. SHe has very fluid and intellectual &quot;big word&quot; communication skills, but when you ask questions, you learn. She is very open to other opinions</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2008<br>Class Name: PHL231<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We had way too much reading and never really understood what she was talking about. She took her time to grade our presentations and to hand out the guidelines for the final paper. And our class blog was a waste of time. Don't take this class unless you really want to or have to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2008<br>Class Name: PHL231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very relaxed person, but always on the ball during class. I found her interesting, thorough and caring about her class and the course material. Rather a bit of reading, but she was reasonable as far as quizzes/papers go. Definitely not difficult to succeed, especially if you're interested in the material. I looked forward to her class every day.</div></div></div></body></html>
