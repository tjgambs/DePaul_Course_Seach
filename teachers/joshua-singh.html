His classes are very interesting. He creates a comfortable atmosphere and is very knowledgeable about what he teaches. Pleasant for the eyes too;) Thumbs up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: PSY240242<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't believe he is going to be a psychologist!He has the worst people skills. I too asked him how his weekend was and he also replied to me, &quot;Um I don't discuss that with students&quot;, wtf&#63; He's horribly disorganized and there is no grading consistency (he'll grade papers harshly & tests easily).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: BIRACIALFP<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was nice, but strange.  His class requires a TON of reading and papers.  He either likes you or doesn't. Be sure to make comments in class and be known. Class if long because there was nothing too enjoyable, but it went well over all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i really like his class... he really is nice and fun, even though he seems kind of stinkity at first. you do have to actually work in his class and he *will* notice if you don't come! but you should probably go to your classes anyway.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2005<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was optional (allowed us to work on research during class time). Online quizes were easy and made powerpoints that included all we needed to know. First paper is graded hard you can revise for a better grade. Very easy to reach and will always help if you ask. Got an A with little effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2004<br>Class Name: PSYCHSTATSI<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got a B, he's not that hard, but horrible organization and people skills! About three of us went to talk with him about a project and very casually asked, &quot;How was your weekend&#63;&quot; His cold reply: &quot;I don't discuss that with my students.&quot; He's a grad student with a superiroritiy complex MINUS the PhD</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2004<br>Class Name: STATA1<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a little unorganized but is very accesible outside class and is willing to help you if you need help.

Tests are not that hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2004<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quizzes and tests are easy, but he grades papers very hard. He is very unorganized, but he will always meet with students who need extra help. I've never seen his TA nor did he provide her e-mail to his students, ironically, he was more unhelpful than she</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2004<br>Class Name: PSY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful professor...easy to get an A if you do the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2004<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He grades papers very harshly.

He let's us redo every paper, but some of us would like to get it right the first time! I have never had my intellect or work ethic more insulted.

The lectures are very thorough and he encourages people to ask questions if they don't understand something.  He's a really nice guy, and a cute one at that!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: EXPLOREISP<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i took his movie class last quarter.
