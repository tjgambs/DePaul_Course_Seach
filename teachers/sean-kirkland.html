He was so eager to talk about the material and hear his students' opinions. It seems like he assigns a lot of work, but it wasn't ever as bad as it sounded and he grades pretty easy. I would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2012<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kirkland was my absolute favorite thing about my first quarter here at Depaul University. During Discover week, he took the time to get to know each and every student and has everyone's name memorized by the second meeting. Not a hard grader at all. Seemed insanely passionate about content and was always fun to listen to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kirkland was a great help in class! There's a lot of reading, and he asks of your opinion a lot, but it is a discussion class. He doesn't embarrass you if you don't know the answer, but rather helps guide you to the right one. He's a great help! I would definitely recommend this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class and the readings were hard, but Professor Kirkland was awesome. He explains everything in class so well. This guy knows what he is talking about. Gives lots of extra credit opportunities. Two tests, which arent too bad and one final paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great help to me in college. I would have been a D average student if it were not for his assistance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Kirkland is amazing! Death and the City was SO much fun. He's a superb teacher and really awesome person otherwise too. He does everything he can do to help you out and grades fairly. If you put in effort in class and in your work, he rewards with good grades. Definitely recommend him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2010<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor K. is brilliant, helpful, and engaging. The work definitely requires personal effort, but you'll be just fine if you really read and take in the material. Take advantage of Immersion Week! He makes it really fun and interesting. Thanks for a great first quarter, Prof. K!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2010<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a nice guy. He helped random people push their car off the street and gave ten dollars to an old lady on the street during Immersion Week. He's really smart not to mention he's hilarious! He's really clear about what he wants and he gives all assignments at the start of the quarter so NO EXCUSES. GREAT guy, really learned a lot from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2010<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kirkland is brilliant (honestly, he's a genius) and gorgeous to boot.  He repeats himself many times, but it is very helpful- he gets clearer each time.  He is also tremendously helpful if you see him during his office hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2010<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really good teacher, knows his stuff. He makes philosophy interesting and understandable. He grades a little hard but very fair and is always willing to help outside of class in anyway he can. I liked that there was always room for discussions and questions during class. I would definitely reccomend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2008<br>Class Name: PHL390<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a really good teacher. i agree with what everyone else says about him being a tough grader. i was a tenth of a point away from getting and A- on my midterm and he didnt bump it up. i was peeved. but hes nice and helpful and responds to all emails.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2007<br>Class Name: PHL293<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Words cannot express how insanely attractive this man is.  He demands a lot from his students, but it's worth it.  I was completely uninterested in Philosophy befor taking his class, but have since found a new appreciation for it.  It's next to impossible to get an A in the class, but he recognizes it if you're trying.  Plus, he's adorable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE DISCOVER CLASS WAS A BLAST THE FIRST WEEK. OUTINGS WERE FUN BUT CLASS SEEMED TO DRAG SINCE IT WAS AN HOUR AND A HALF ONCE A WEEK. BOOKS WE READ WERE BORING EXCEPT FOR &quot;STIFF&quot; THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING! PAPERS ARE HARD TO WRITE BUT YOU CAN GET THROUGH THEM WITH TIME. OVERALL A NICE GUY TO TALK TO AND GET ADVICE FROM.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: PHL362<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is ok.. little hard...expect too much from you...wants you to be on time not even a second late...he thinks students dont have life outside the Aristotle's world...very demanding...Hard grader...doesnt take anything electronically...you have to go to the philosophy department and drop the hard copy there.so inconvenien.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2006<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice, helpful, funny.  Lectures are interesting for the most part but he can talk about 5 pgs for an entire hour and a half. Makes philosophy interesting. Expects a lot but we only had a midterm and a final paper plus some reading questions. Fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2006<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Smart, nice, helpful, and sooo cute!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: ARISTOTLE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wish all profs were as cool and engaging as Kirkland. He is so nice too and goes out of the way to help you. And he makes philosophy accessible. What more can you ask&#63; Oh yeah, and I didn't think he was that cute when I first took his class but by the end of the quarter, I had a major crush on this man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2005<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Kirkland is a brilliant man.  The knowledge he has on philosophy is amazing. I enjoy sitting through his class just because there is always something new I learn.  He is a tough grader but at the same time he is still very fair. If you give him what he asks for you'll be set.  Def take Prof. K if you get the chance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, hot, makes funny jokes, but hard grader.  Then again, PHL isn't a breeze, so Kirkland is probably pne of the best to take.  The class is great because your questions lead discussion.  oh, and again, hot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very entertaining prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: PHL320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard grader.  Otherwise, he is a great lecturer and makes sure everyone understands the material by always asking if anyone has an questions.  He's funny too, always cracking a joke here and there to keep the class going.  You can tell that he knows the material very well.  Daily assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a brilliant guy!  Also, very cute.  He is pretty challenging though, on tests and papers he expects very thorough explanations, he really wants you to master the material.  Very entertaining in class, I would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2005<br>Class Name: PHL320362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He rocks!! I would say take him even if u have other options. Hes not very hard or easy, but in the middle. I got two easy A's, if u read the assignments and do good on midterm adn a final paper, ull be happy with the grade youll recieve. The Best philosophy teacher AT DEPAUL.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2004<br>Class Name: PHL293<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enthusiastic, very ingelligent, has most of the works memorized in greek.
