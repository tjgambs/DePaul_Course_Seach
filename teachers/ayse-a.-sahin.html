She did an ok job explaining the concepts but the lack of 100% correct proof solutions available made tests really difficult. Luckily she was open to you coming in for office hours but would have been nice to get some solutions posted at the end before the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2015<br>Class Name: 261<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She thinks her way is the only way to teach, she makes you feel horrible for asking questions. She thinks she's funny, when she's not. Most importantly her test do not reflect her homework or quizzes, she expects you to 'apply' what you know. She is a frustrating professor,  and she was not able to go over everything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: MAT261<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>can't deliver information. doesn't give enough examples. quizzes and tests do not reflect the homework.

Take her if you have a chance. This is the second class I have taken with her, and I dont have anything to complain. Her exams are tough though so that's up to you to put the effort.  Homework and examples come straight from the textbook.  I am definitely taking her again for my higher level classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2015<br>Class Name: MAT261<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's better for lower level math classes. If you're serious about math, don't take her! She wastes time in class and is not good at explaining exactly how to do things. She just annoys me. Very reminiscent of high school - not ok for multivariable calculus 2 or any college course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2012<br>Class Name: MTH170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sahin is an amazing math teacher. Her lectures are put together perfectly. If something is unlear, just ask. If you attend class, the test material comes directly from in-class notes and homework assignments. This class has been tremendously helpful in other science course....don't be scared of the lab. Its just an application day. TAKE THIS CLASS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2012<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will definitely have to work for the grade you want.

She was always in a good mood though, and always willing to help you. The class is hard, and you can't get caught behind on your work. You will always know when things are due, when tests are, etc. Genuinely good person!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has changed the course a lot and you can no longer skip any parts of the lecture or you will be incredibly behind. Only helpful if you can make her office hours, which I could not because of other classes. SCIENCE MAJORS DO NOT NEED THIS COURSE, DO NOT TAKE IT, TAKE THE 150 OR 160 SEQUENCE INSTEAD</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2011<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun teacher, good class.  It starts slow, but it picks up after a few weeks.  Very helpful and many opportunities to raise your grade.  Her TA is really cute, and he's only a junior, so he'll be around next year, too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2010<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great, uppity and knowledgeable teacher.  She makes the lectures fun, and they are definitely relevant (especially 172!).  Tests based off the homework and lectures, so come to class and do the work and you'll be fine!  She's the reason I switched to a Math major :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>took her for 170 sequence. Sahin is a great teacher. He really helps you understand the material and the TA is EXTREMELY helpful. Although she does talk quite quickly and get's excited randomly, he still gets the job done. Labs do help in understanding the material at least to me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took BMS 125 in the 5 week summer session along with ACC-101 and still got an A in hers. She is a great teacher, funny, go to office hours. Our class had a blast which was great! I learned a whole lot, but you must always.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: MAT172<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>170 Sequence is kinda easy, sorry Bio kids.  At times it felt a little unnecessarily slow. Still fulfills my requirement, so hey.  I agree that labs are busy work, and thus only went to the first one during 170 and then never again.  Regardless, great teacher, very nice.  Also, even if you tank the class, but ace the final, you get an A.  Whoo!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2009<br>Class Name: MAT172<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love it or Hate it. Great Teacher, Hard Grader. I am not a Calc Whiz, but she makes things very clear, however complex the material may be. She is a little fast when she talks and quirky, but no complaints. Taking this class a year after I finished 171, little hard to catch up but the teacher is a great motivator. Definitely take this if your PREME</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2008<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sahin is a great teacher and a wonderful person. Under her instruction, calculus was very understandable, and the labs helped show some interesting biological applications of the things we were learning in lecture. Also, she's a little... off. In the head. But that's what makes her (and calculus) fun!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mrs Sahin.. We can't figure out where she is from. She is kinda weird. She can be entertaining, in an annoying way. Her labs are busy work and only occasionally helpful. Although she offers help outside of class, her lectures are kind of hard to explain. Her explanations make you more confused. She also laughs when she is angry.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: MAT172<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not transfer out of the 170 sequence once you start it.  The 172 class is great!  Dr. Sahin does an awesome job of using the material in real life scenarios.  She is so helpful and truly truly cares about her student.  She is the only teacher in the math dept. that always has a huge group of students at a blackboard.  She is the BEST!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: MAT110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for 110 and 111. TAKE this prof. if you want to learn. If you want an easy way out go with someone else. She is the BEST at what she does. She makes you think about the answer and why it is wrong or right. She is the BEST. Everyone who marks her low are just lazy and didnt come to class. TAKE HER!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: MAT110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for 110 and 111.

I only got a B+ in the class, yet I say I deserved it. She seems too perky at times, but when she is teaching, the material is taught with great efficiency. All depends on what you put into the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2007<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is sooooo nice!!! Some people didn't like her because she can sometimes put you on the spot.  But in the end you learn a lot.  DO THE HOMEWORK!!!  lots the questions on the tests and quizzes are right from the homework.  Laugh at her jokes, and answer questions.... you'll be golden!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2006<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very fair grader.  She does a lot to make sure you get the grade you deserve.  If you go to class and do the homework (if you need to), you should do well.  She likes to help you a little and then make you figure things out yourself.  She is kind of difficult, but in the end, the grade you recieve is fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is generous and truly wants you to succeed. She does what she can to help your grade if you try (makeup tests, drops quizzes, etc). People don't like that they have to do homework to follow the class, which should be expected. If you ask questions and show you care, you'll find yourself succeeding and her help at hand. Ask questions and work!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2006<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is friendly and generous (ex drops quizzes).

It is true that she claims she will help but then makes you feel dumb for not knowing it. Sometimes she will start talking way too fast and you have no idea what is going on. All i can say is i've always got a's in math (including calculus) until now, when i got a c. That was the class average.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2006<br>Class Name: MATH172<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I owe my sucessful completion of this difficult 3-quarter sequence to the excellent instruction provided by Dr. Sahin.

She's not hard, but she takes off for stupid things.  She complicates issues and is unclear.  She treats you like a high-school student as well.  Esp.

I have never had I nicer or more helpful teacher and she only counts 4 quiz and homework grades out of like 7 or 8!  She teaches calculus!  Its hard!

She talks to fast. She asks us if we have any questions but hesitates to answer them, she tells us to keep trying and then come back to her, but she never gives you a clear, correct answer. She is not good at explaining sometimes she confuses herself. If you are good at teaching yourself take this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Outstanding teacher.

Maybe it was the material, but she was not a good professor. I studied my arse off and still got a D. When I came to her for help, she told me to look the material over in the book (which was about 2-3 chapters worth of crap).

She really likes Math and sometimes gets too excited about a certain subject and starts speaking really fast, so it's hard to follow. We had weekly quizes and even though they don't affect your grade, most of the test questions are taken directly from quizes.
