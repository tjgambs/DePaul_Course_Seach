He understands the material and can explain it clearly. He is one of the smartest professors I've ever had. He claims he skipped class as an undergrad...to be honest that's not hard to believe as he's a genius. I'd take him again in a heartbeat. There wasn't too much HW, the midterm and final was a bit challenging.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: NONE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful teacher and is always there for help!
