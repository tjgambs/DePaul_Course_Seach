    Prof. Jaang is a nice man, but that shouldn't make him a professor at DePaul. His lectures are impossible to follow due to his issues with the English language. Lectures are therefore boring and a waste of time. No DePaul student deserves anything like that. Grades on 2 midterms and a final. If you have interest in learning during class, avoid him!
