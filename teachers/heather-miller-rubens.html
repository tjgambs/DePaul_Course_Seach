    I took her for REL 221 and she was very helpful! She doesn't just answer the questions for you, she enjoys class participation.  For this class we had materials from D2L, and a thin reading on Locke. We mostly focused on court cases pertaining to religion (Europe/US)that you will print. There are a few papers. She is great! I would take her again!
