Slammon was easy to understand and very helpful. He wss an awesome grader and will help anyone who needs it. Midterm and Final are pieces of cake (as long as you take some solid notes). Quizes were easy as well. He even offered extra credit. I highly recomend this class. Expect to get an A easily--as long as you pay attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>soooooo terrible. i still have nightmares.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  Extremelly helpful. Give study guides for midterm and final which make reading optional. He warns you about quizes on readings before they happen so you can be prepared. very nice guy and very good teacher. I would definately take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so cute--not too mention nice. He loves what he is doing, which is always helpful. Show up to class and you will do just fine. I never used my book--I just took his notes from class, they are all you need. He gives you the option to take the final exam or do essays. He also gives a clear steady guide--if you know that you will get an A or B</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very interesting class. he likes to teach and best of all is very knowledgable. Easy to follow class, quizzes are essays but just read and you will do fine.

His quizzes are usually essay like and he gives out extra credit. Quite an easy grader and it is nice to get to know him on a more personal level-he's a cool guy. However, he does try to keep the class going, and the awkward silence is pretty frequent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good teacher, pretty easy, listens to students, watch movies, little boring though especially when no one talks, akward silence.

He actually treats you like an equal and not just a student. you get to watch some movies and you can either chose to write 3 papers or take a final. He's worth taking. Although you gotta go to class and ur there until the last second</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good teacher & it is obvious he cares about what hes talking about, and has a lot to say for lectures/discussion.  however by the end of the quarter i found class was very boring. reading is only homework, midtern& final & 4 quizes.  not hard and a good teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Polished presenter.

The bad part is that he's strict on attendence and lowers your final grade for every unexcused absence.  Most importantly he is SOO HOT and his voice is SO sexy. TAKE HIM GIRLS!</div></div></div></body></html>
