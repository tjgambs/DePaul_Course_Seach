    He is clear and concise and seems to know some other material besides himself. The unfortunate part about this teacher is the way he treats other human beings with intimidation and threats. Don't be afraid of the work, just don't subject yourself to his torture of sorts. He will threaten students constantly and make accusations. You will hate him!

    I ended up complaining to the Fin Dept about this guy because he would not help or answer my emails outside of class! If your willing to teach yourself the material, then this is your class. I HIGHLY recommend you take this class with a diff professor! Half the class dropped or failed and he will not even curve, if you have a 69.9%! GOOD LUCK!

    I absolutely hated this professor! He is not clear on what he wants on the exams, so you literally have to read all 3 books and EVERYTHING in them!!! He likes to brag about himself a lot, which is annoying! And he is very condescending!

    This class is difficult.  Ignore the 14 page syllabus. I did learn a lot from his class. He is very clear during his lectures. Ask questions if you're confused. Keep up with the readings, and write down everything he puts on the board in class(most of the exam material is on in class lecture). Exams are difficult but not impossible (think people!)

    Wow, by far the worst professor at DePaul. He is very cocky and has a 14 page syllabus! Who has a 14 page syllabus... DO NOT TAKE!

    This Professor is only here to collect a paycheck! He likes to intimidate his students the 1st day of class by showing who failed and dropped the previous semester! I agree with the previous comments that he does not reply to emails and is not available outside of class! I HIGHLY recommend that you guys take this course with a diff Professor!

    This is the WORST "Teacher." He does not know how to teach &amp; does not care about his students.  He lacks office hours and feels it is not his responsibility to respond to student e-mails. His tests are given when he feels like it and they are on material he never covered.  Then, he has you buy 3 books, none of which you use. Take DIFF teacher.

    He was a nice guy, but very unclear as to what he wanted and what the tests would be about. His lectures were often jumbled and hard to follow. If you do take him you'll have two midterms and two quizzes. There's a lot of reading but make sure you keep up with it

    I personal thought we wasnt that bad, going in i was a little intimidated. However he genuinely is a nice guy and answered all my questions that i had. Tests are covered mainly from lectures, no curve balls. he honestly just wants his students to learn.

    Avoid this guy. He thinks his outside experience translates into teaching, but he's terrible with explaining what he wants. If you have to take him make sure you do the readings (which there are a ton of) because he can't teach worth anything.

    I'll set the record straight.  If you want to be spoon fed and told you deserve an "A" for just being you don't take this professor. This prof and class is like a good workout, you may not enjoy every minute of it but you know its good for you. Honestly, this prof does good job explaining concepts in class, but you better come prepared to class.

    Ethy is annoying because of the arrogance he brings to class. He retells stories from the &quot;real world&quot;, which are boring and useless. Class work is chronologically as follows: Quiz  1, midterm, pop quiz, quiz 2, and final. The assigned readings are annoying ly wordy, and he regurgitates. Enjoy boredom if you take him. Also overuses &quot;intuitive.&quot;

    Great guy. Straight forward but don't give out much of a road map but the stuff he takes time to the class and does what he can to make the course overwhelming

    STAY AWAY. this guy is by far one of the worst professors I have ever had at DePaul. It was his first time teaching and he knew nothing about how class is taught at DePaul but being that hes so arrogant he thought he knew everything because he had &quot;real world&quot; experience. He was not helpful to students and he was condecending if u asked questions.
