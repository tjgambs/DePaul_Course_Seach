She is incredibly intelligent and has more passion for children then any other professor I have encountered. The course is A LOT of work but she guides you every step of the way and it is incredibly beneficial. If you are an ECE major do not graduate without taking her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2009<br>Class Name: TL423<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bayat is incredible.

Did not believe in giving tests, so we had a lot of writing assignments. She assigned a lot of large projects in beginning, but the class commented that it was a lot of work. She then cut  a few assignments out to lessen the load. Very helpful and understanding. Definitely take another class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: ECE290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is by far the most interesting women I have ever met.
