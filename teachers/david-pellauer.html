Despite his &quot;everything is discussible&quot; idea, he spent most of the class talking himself and going on long rambles that could be incredibly dull.

If you participate and put forth a decent effort you should be fine.  This isn't a class you can skip or sleep in, but it's not impossible either.  He teaches to the text, so read!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2010<br>Class Name: PHL390<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a professor who teaches Logic in a very illogical manner.  He's unclear, he takes all of the answers straight from the book and even then makes mistakes on proofs.  If you don't get an answer right (he calls on everyone) you feel humiliated.  I took an intro to logic course and did well the quarter before then did terrible in this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2010<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard, harsh, unfair.

Dr. Pellauer's still got it - he's enthusiastic and clear in his lectures. The only downside to this class was some classmates who have anything but respect for him and his thought-provoking insights on philosophy. Take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2009<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pellauer gets a bad rap. He's got something of a non-traditional teaching method; his paper topics are broad, for the purpose of making you explore your own ideas as opposed to regurgitating facts. Thought-provoking course. I was extremely disappointed with how childish my classmates were when forced to try something outside their comfort zones.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2009<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the papers arent that hard to write, he's not picky about tone or even lenght, he just wants you to convey and support good ideas. plus, you get rewrites.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2009<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's quirky and he'll help if you ask for it. he's real open to answering questions and &quot;everything is discussable&quot; it is, after all, a philosophy class. he knows his stuff well and i think he does a great job</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was really interesting and I think it worked out well as my first philo class.  He's a weird guy, kind of has a creepy breathy laugh&#63; It bothered me, but he's REALLY into class participation which is like 25% of your grade. Then there's 3 papers and a journal. You can rewrite the papers that he doesn't grade that hard in the first place.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2008<br>Class Name: PHL350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is like the worst professor ever.

However, the class conversations can get really confusing. I didn't understand much of what we talked about. He is a really fair grader and will let you rewrite papers as many times as you want. He is also open to discussing moving due dates and the like.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2007<br>Class Name: HON104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be ready for some critical analysis, this guy is very tough for an introductory class to philosophy. While you ARE able to rewrite essays, his grading is enormously hard. Without strong writing skills, you WILL fail this class. He lacks an ability to help you fix the essay but is very ready to criticize it. This class was the worst.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2007<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite non-science professors. If you are bad at writing a decent essay I would not recommend you for his class. He is brilliant. He does not rebuff anyones ideas or opinions, but he does challenge your thoughts in order to make you think more in depth. He is the reason I'm gonna be a philo minor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2006<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked him.

There are a few minor other assignments but you need to speak up in class to be able to get an A even if you get A's on all your papers. Yes he expects a little to much but he is willing to work with you and ur grade in the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2006<br>Class Name: SYMBOLICLOGIC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He sucks, doesn't explain anything, but expects you to know the material immediately.
