He barely includes materials related to his work experience or explains questions directly. The ratings before are fair. He is serious about some details, which does not make sense.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2011<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One word, hubris. Treats students like children. This guy would be better suited teaching 3rd Grade times tables.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2011<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Poor quality. Didn't really explain anything. No real world experience and expects everything to be done like an accademic report instead of preparing you for the real world (he will mark you down for it too). Seems typical of the DePaul Finance Department.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2010<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy but very mediocre. Career teacher w/out much if any real world experience as he never spoke of anything he ever accomplished in business. This plays out in a simplistic view of the world and a shallow course. Course not hard, but penalizes grades severely for minor mistakes or views other than his. Provides little feedback on work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2009<br>Class Name: FIN563<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not recomend this class in any circumstance. He actually asings case studies on the sameday as mid terms and finanls.  I spent approximatly 12-15 hours out of class each week, learning what he did not teach. In class, he pretty much. Just reads off of Powerpoint. Worst class in program.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2008<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Howe and his co-professor (an investment banker from Lehman Brothers)taught this 798 class together. I learned a lot from his class. Although, he's not an easy grader, he cares a lot about his students. Well, this class is not a pure lecture class. You have to do your study and you will learn how to apply your knowledge to solve a problem.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2008<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Howe team-taught this course with Diane Swonk, the economist who is always on CNBC. She took the first five weeks, him the last. At least she was entertaining, even if not very informative. He is an arrogant blowhard who pretends to know about valuation but surely can't explain what he claims to know. What a waste of time and tuition money!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Howe is very down to earth and approachable; knows the material; and gives it to you straight. If you put forth the effort, you will learn. If you need help, he will assist.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expectations were not met with this class . .sounded really interesting, but was a let down.  Howe thought the students were as well versed in valuation as he is.  He offered little explanation of the material and his response were too vague.  Outside speaker was interesting, but I didn't come away feeling confident doing a DCF analysis.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2006<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Howe challenges you to think.  Finance is a tough subject, but he is fair and interesting.  He is very good at connecting real corporate scenarios with the material.  His use of examples are very good.  I learned a lot from this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: GSB641<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a Valuation class at Graduate level. This professor expects you to do all work. He is tough grader and you should not expect much flexibility from him. If you're good with Finance and Valuation, he is good since he brings some industry folks to come and talk in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2006<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Howe makes you think.  You may not think you are understanding everything but by the end of the class you will have learned so much.  This is his strategy and he is good at it.  He will not baby you so students who don't study need to go elsewhere.  I took his class and can say it was a cornerstone class for valuation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not everybody gets and A, but if you put the time in its a great introduction to how economic influences affect valuation. Dynamic class, well structured. Professor has always been available when I've emailed or stopped by his office. I would recommend this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is not very clear...either a lack of preparation or a lack of effective communication skills...the jury is still out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2005<br>Class Name: FIN553<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher.Reads from slides without explaining material.Distributes practice problems and solutions but doesn't explain answers.Never answers questions directly.Doesn't demonstrate a thorough understanding of material.Adds no value to class.I could get the same grade if given the material and no professor.Tuition is too high for this.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
