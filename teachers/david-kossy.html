David will call on you at random and require that you answer specific questions about what he perceives to be important. - this was all written professionally btw.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2014<br>Class Name: EGL102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good instructor. He's all over the place some times but has good intentions. He is very accessible via phone and email for feedback on assignments. If you want to learn to write you want to take someone who will challenge you and give you the tools to get better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes class really fun and he's good at what he does.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At the beginning, I loathed going to Kossy's class because I wasn't used to a professor just yapping and digressing. Once you get used to it it becomes easy. Just make sure you follow the guidelines of papers and attend class. Overall he's a good guy with a good sense of humor but I think his professional presentation could be better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He slurs his words and this gives off the impression that he is high.  He's very liberal. You have no clue what grade you're getting.  Honestly, it seems like your grade depends on his mood.  Pick another teacher if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really good professor.

He is interesting and different in a good way. He is respectful of different opinions and makes class fun with videos and interesting articles. There are a lot of chances to get the grade you want. The general class feel is very laid back.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, he is incredibly political/liberal, but he is really interested in listening to the opinions of individuals. His essays aren't all that difficult, and he is clear cut on what he wants. He truly wants you to see you improve as a writer and keeps the class discussions really interesting and engaging. Definitely recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE X100. NEVER TAKE HIM. he is absolutely the worst ever. all over the place, pointless papers, he grades SOOO hard, and he never makes any sense. i truly do not know why someone would give him a decent review. he is a nice guy but should definitely NOT be teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy, a little liberal, but he can always start up an interesting debate/ conversation. He swears a lot but he's a nice guy. The most annoying thing is he marks your paper low without telling you why. If you're into politics, choose this guy in a heartbeat.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you enjoy an annoyingly liberal hippie dude trying to teach a writing class and do not need any guidance in the slightest, then go for it!  however, he is very forgetful and has a very unclear way of grading, so if you would enjoy actually getting something out of this class, i get out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof. Sure, he's liberal, but he's open to other opinions. He'll help you out if you need it, and actually wants you to get a good grade. Talk to him! He's a nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2010<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST TEACHER EVER.

I took the class during the presidential election and the debates where always fun! At times it was just a bit difficult to understand what it was that he wanted from the papers. the great thing was that he always  was willing to help out! Take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved professor Kossy! I recommend taking him. He is funny, intelligen, and alwayshas something different to offer the class. he is flexible with due dates on papers, and is open to suggestions from students. He is very helpful when writing papers and incredibly knowledgeable about the english language. The readings are all interesting. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gets a lot of crap, but he's a good professor. Yes, he's completely liberal, but he'll listen to you regardless of political beliefs. He's a fair grader, and lets you re-do a paper if you really miss the ball. Lax about tardiness and shows good movies. Also, the reading is pretty interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HAHA, dave. look, he's a liberal who LOVES to smoke - that's jus how it is! he's a good guy and knows his stuff about writing. If you write well enuf, do the readings and come to class you'll pass, EASY. my final paper was on smoking BANS and i got an A so don't hate on him bcuz he IS fair. jus smoked a lil too much pot back in the day...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2009<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The previous ratings are obviously by freshman who take themselves too seriously. I took him during my last quarter. I may have thought the same way 4 years ago, but I doubt it. This guy is laid back and funny as hell. He is very helpful, will proofread everything before you turn it in. Go have a cig with him sometime, you'll enjoy the experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kossy, is extremely personable, although his WRD 104 class was kind of difficult, but I'm a procrastinator and put off doing the ten page paper.  He is easy going with due dates, but that's probably he gets confused himself.  He is passionate about his work and is an adamant liberal, so watch out!  He loves students with passion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2009<br>Class Name: ENGALL<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok i took Kossy 3 times for different classes. look,he is easy if you know the trick.you have to have all stuff turned in by the last day.so the day he &quot;says&quot; its due bring it to class and say hey can you look this over.GO back and make the changes and poof easy A. i did it with 3 classes he taught. simple!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dave was such a fun guy, he's old and swears every other sentence.  He's really easy going and lets you out of class early most days.  He rambles for most of the class period about nothing relating to the course matter which gets annoying but if you do the reading and take time on your writing, you should be fine :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Alright looks like he gets a bad rap but this is the kinda teacher i love. went off on tangents about the election and about his hippy days. But with that you learn some about life experiences. dont know if i learned anything from this class haha but still love dave. want to take him for 104. 6 papers= 3short 3long and put together portfolio at end</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIM. we spend more time talking about obama and how great kossy thinks he is that we do talking about writing.  i have learned absoultely nothing in his class and yet he grades papers tough. he can barely go an hour without wanting a cigarette and his rants that he goes off on about mccain and palin are offensive and unprofessional</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I personally didn't like the guy all he talked about was his hippy stuff and wasn't too helpful when it came to writing papers. For the final paper all he did was tell me was how bad it was and offered no advice. Regardless, I still got a B in the class. He's not a tough grader and he can be a pretty funny guy at times</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't see how Dave has such a low rating. Sure he likes to talk, but he is great at teaching the subject. Take him. :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its not the fact that he's a hard grader, its the fact that he goes off on unnecessary tangents and doesn't stop for 20 min. His assignments are vague and sometimes useless. He is full of himself and thinks he's funny. And his references to the 60's are overused. Take him if you can bare tangents and can write fairly well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2008<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For those that gave this professor a poor rating, you probably didn't do well on one paper and then you just gave up. This professor just wants to make his students better writers. If you show that you care and that you want to learn, the rest will follow.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class to be in and a helpful teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2007<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not ahard grader. He is very laid back and understanding. You write alot of papers but they are interesting. You also take alot of quizes but if you have read the material than you will ace them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2007<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He cannot teach.  All he does is hand out vague assignments and put poor grades on them.  You cannot read his feedback on papers and when you can it doesn't make any sense.  If you don't agree with his views or love of the 60's he won't give you a good grade.  I learned more about what kind of cigarettes he likes than about English.  Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2007<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, not the greatest professor. He really doesn't spend any time teaching the class how to do the work. Instead, he unloads a lot of work to be done without explaining what he expects from us. His assignments are demanding and his grading is strict. But, I must admit that his laid back/ hippie personality maked the class less horrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't appreciate being interrupted by a professors. All he wants to do is talk about all the hippie music he likes. He doesn't listen to his students and doesn't give constructive notes on the papers you do. Absolutely no structure to the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everybody thinks that this guy is out there wit his stories, but in some strange way, it all comes back to what we're talking about in class.  Biggest thing is term paper, but he really makes it easy for you.  A lot of stupid quizzes and papers that he  gives out A's and B's for.  Show some basic interest in the class and Dave and you'll do a B</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher. Class time always wasted. Grades you on how you relate to him and his love for the 60s. I can't believe he was hired at a private college like DePaul University!He's not even fit to teach grade school English!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He comes off as so laid back and just wants students to think everything is cool.  No due dates for assignments, occasional quizes, couple papers...but he totally focuses on the final research paper and is of absolutely no help whatsoever.  If you ask him to look over a paper he will give you good feedback and then when you go to turn it's a C-.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He incorporates alot of interesting political stuff into the class...he is very laid back and often we are out of class early...the work load however was alot...and he has a very particular style he wants...so make sure to ask for specific help on what he wants u to do differently...funny guy who refers to bands and events i had never heard of</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kossy is an intelligent man, but I couldnt tell if he didnt want to teach anything, or he just doesnt' know how. He's a terrible combination of being both unclear about assignments and a tough grader. Spends a lot of time going off on tangents that make little sense and his jokes end with the class staring at him awkwardly.

He also makes the class interesting cuz hes kinda wacky :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is absolutley ridiculous. Kossy down talks the students. He puts students on blast in fron t of the entire class and most of the time he doesn't even have his stuff together. I spent the whole hour and a half sitting in that class wondering  why am i  here. Do not take this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dave is really nice guy!  he makes class fun and interesting! This class is laid back, but as he warns, his papers are a challenge.  Expect to put in effort but if you've ever written a paper its not that big of a deal.  He wants his students to be creative and hes a really funny guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is lazy and tries to hard to be likeable.

As long as you have a rough draft in on time, you can take your time with the final.

He's fun in class, and his assignments leave room for creativity. Even though he's laid back, he still grades hard; so you can't get away with crap work. I plan to take his class again for 104.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is pointless and he takes it personal if you don't show up(lowers your grade). forget getting a decent grade on your papers. i will make sure i don't end up in his class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2004<br>Class Name: 101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dave (Can't use his last name because he will get pissed) is a very difficult teacher.
