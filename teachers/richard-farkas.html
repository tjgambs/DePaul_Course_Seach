As long as you come to class with an interest in what he's teaching, then you will enjoy it. Go to office hours to talk. Graded on iClicker quizzes before every lecture (on topics from last lecture), 2 oral essays (1 at beginning and 1 at end), 2 written essays (at end of course), and a final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2014<br>Class Name: PSCI150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>He is an amazing teacher. He will rip your opinions a new one, simply because he wants you to think more critically. If you can't handle having your ideas challenged, don't take this class. If you're interested in learning more and can put your ego to the side for a good hour and a half, he's great. He also is one of the kindest humans alive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: PSC251<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His way or the highway. Does not respond to emails and won't engage student concerns if he doesn't find them to be significant. Does not pay attention to DePaul finals policy, and declares assignments "optional" but then penalizes students for not submitting. Only professor I've ever had real problems with, and only one i've ever cared to rate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2012<br>Class Name: PSC390<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Farkas is an interesting person. He might appear intimidating at first, but that perception goes away fast. He is not considered "easy" because has high standards for all of his students, which are not difficult to prove if one puts in the effort. His classes are thought-provoking and I always came out of them with a new point of view.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2011<br>Class Name: PSC243<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very rude and arrogant. Disrespectful. Does not improve my feelings about the Political Science department. He belittles his students and only his word matters, the student's input does not. I do not recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2011<br>Class Name: PS2556<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously, he's great. I should be up front and say that the class definitley made me cry a couple times, but I also learned a ridiculously large amount. He knows everything and has some great stories. Don't take his class if you're looking for an easy one, but DO take it if you're looking for an adventure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2010<br>Class Name: PSC393<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very random class. You will learn a lot about life, but if you want an A, d not take the class. Everything is unclear and your final grade is based on nothing. Totally subjective class without any explanation for assignments or grades. However, you will definately learn a lot if you dont care about your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: PSC251<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable and pretty funny. If you make an effort towards the readings and pay attention in class you will do fine on the daily iclicker questions that take the place of a midterm. 1 brief research paper and multiple choice and essay final. Overall good guy and for those that got offended by him, your probably a bunch of pussies.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2010<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He had us choose between the grade we had already earned in the class or to take the final and get that grade. (not averaged together!) And yes, if the grade on the final was lower you get that grade. This isn't Vegas, it's college - students should never have a grade taken away from them that they have already earned. AVOID HIM</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2010<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rude. Disrespectful. Arrogant. Belittling. I'm shocked that there are so many positive reviews.I prefer professors who treat you as an equal, but he treats students like we work for him or owe him something. He teaches the material well but the extra stuff on the side isn't worth it - take someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2009<br>Class Name: PSC393<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is old school for sure.  Good class, will get you actually thinking.  Syllabus is totally unclear.  Very intelligent but very aware of that fact and arrogant because of it, but that seems to be the case of almost every professor in comparative politics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: PSC393<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Farkas is a good professor with an enormous amount of experience. However, before taking him, keep in mind this: 1. He's got  an acid sense of humor. Not for those easily offended. 2. You can't win an argument with him. You just can't. It's a special talent of his. I would recommend him more for lecture classes - as opposed to seminar.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2008<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely knowledgeable.

In other words, he's tough, but fair and respectful.  Be prepared to do tons of reading.  There is a paper, but as long as fits the assignment, he'll give you a decent grade for it.  If you're from the former USSR, you'll find his take on the politics interesting.  Exams are really hard, though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2008<br>Class Name: PSC251<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>overall, he was a good teacher. Not really into student discussions, very into speaking by himself. Attendance is crucial. Class instructions sometimes vague. Grading not that difficult, funny man.

Overall the class was easy as long as you always agree with what he is saying and don't give your own opinions because he'll find a way to prove you wrong.

Luckily, other professors came in to teach a lot so that took away from time we had to listen to him ramble and degrade our generation. The exams were ridiculous.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2007<br>Class Name: PSC390<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart man but not big on student discussion. He likes to talk at you, tends to cut you off when you speak, but expects you to seek him out at office hours. Great syllabus for a capstone, could be awesome if it weren't so lacking in student discussion. He's more interested in telling us what's wrong with our generation. Avoid for capstone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2007<br>Class Name: HON350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In one of the first classes, he described himself as a &quot;crusty, old man&quot;.
