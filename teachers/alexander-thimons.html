    He tries to explain but doesn't do a good job at it and he also lectures.  Those are really the only things wrong.

    This guy does not post his lectures until after the class... Let that sink in. He has a very confusing teaching method where he likes things his way, which is fine, only he make things really confusing and harder than they should be. This is with your assignments and lectures in class. The best thing about him is no text book are required.
