Taking online course and feel completely without communication or direction. Though this was reputed to be a difficult class, I was looking forward to taking it.  This teacher makes it even more difficult through poor communication.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2007<br>Class Name: FOUNDL2<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of spacey. No clear syllabus. Kind of guess your way through as far as assignments. This was an online class -- prof didn't readily reply to emails/calls. Too spacey to be helpful, didn't really &quot;get&quot; your questions, too much back and forth trying to clarify what she wanted/what you needed to do. Needs a syllabus w/assignments outlined.</div></div></div></body></html>
