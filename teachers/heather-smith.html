    She was a good teacher and presented the material in an interesting manner. I would recommend her if you are really interested in Chicago history. The grades and criteria were clearly stated and the class was overall enjoyable. This class seems to focus on the social characteristics of the city- easy if you do everything the way she wants.

    New Urbanism class. Take this prof if you want a super easy class, super easy grader, almost no lectures, final paper simply based on course readings (prove you've read them). Group presentation on a neighborhood which requires site visits and other research.  You don't get pick your group members but she does take points off if someone screws up.

    There are very interesting parts of this New Urbanism class. I like when we had discussions. The field trips were okay, I wish there were better planned but at least we got out the classroom. She is a fairly hard grader but you can meet with her most of the day. But DON'T miss class, that will look bad and she will send you a scathing e-mail.
