    Professor Morgan is a great professor. He will literally bend over backwards to help you succeed. He is one down to earth soul and he is a very passionate teacher. He tries his best to make Risk Management an interesting subject. He also is funny. Take him, he's fair test giver and at the end of the day, he cares. If only there were more like him.
