His delivery of lectures is flawless.  He is very approachable and friendly.  I'd say he's the best professor in his department.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2013<br>Class Name: IT232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof was very helpful when I got stuck on assignments.

It is very easy, but he isn't very helpful.  The classes are recorded on camera, so going to class isn't necessary or helpful.  The notes he puts on his website are all you need to get an A.  Take the class.  It will be the easiest SI credit you can get.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2007<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was easy, lecture attendence is not required, though LAB should be attended to ask any questions pertaining to the assignments given. Assignments are pretty easy and he is willing to help if needed, though he will not just do it for you. I went to all the labs and hardly any of the lectures and easily obtained an A. I'd take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Miller is a very nice guy. He explains the material thoroughly and is available for help outside of class. Attendance is not mandatory because he tapes the lectures. I went to class about half the time and easily got a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2007<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a tool, he barely learned anything after the first few classes.  He is a horrible teacher, i pretty much had to teach myself the material.  Does not take any late assignments even if you are sick and have a doctors note.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: HCI210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear and organized with lectures and assignments.
