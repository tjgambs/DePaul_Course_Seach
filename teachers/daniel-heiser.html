Lectures are extremely boring, and hard to follow. No mid term, so once it's time for the final you pretty much know nothing, and he does little to help you prepare, since he expects you to know everything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of the worst classes I've taken at DePaul. Nothing I learned here will be applicable to my major or job. It is a hybrid class. Prof. is not easily accessible because he travels. He does not teach very well so you have to rely on the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2014<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is pretty decent, but I'm having trouble because he isn't there half of the time. He is in charge of managing DePaul's international investments, so, for almost half of the class time, he wasn't even in the country. I don't like online classes and he is teaching this this class like he is a tutor for an online class. PS hybrid course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2012<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most worthless professors I've had.  Says 10% of your grade is participation yet doesn't engage the class at all.  Will lecture straight from the powerpoint for the entire class period.  He can't get to the point on ANYTHING and talks way too much.  Shouldn't even be a professor at all.  Most. Boring. Professor. Ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2008<br>Class Name: MGT302<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You only do about two projects and one of them is with a partner of your choice.

Ask him anything about operations, China, and doing business in China and you won't be disappointed. He is very nice, approachable, and flexible. I would take him again if given the opportunity.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher knows his stuff.  real world experience.  frustating b/c midterm was over 18 chapters and testt only consisted of 15 questions.  find it wastful he teaches about quality but teaching method is qauntiy.  never got into depth in any subject(disappointing). be prepaired for wasting 4 grand for stupid kindergarden science experiments! dont take</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2007<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing!

Over-used the phrase  &quot;If you will&quot;.  Talked to a Power Point in each class for 3 hours, so it got kind of boring after a while.  Took too long to post grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very interesting professor and is very helpful as well.  He will help you with what you don't understand.  He is easily accessible and relates much of the lectures to everyday situations.  Participation affects your grade.  Read and have questions.  The study guides are great for the MT and Final exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2007<br>Class Name: MGT598<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had hoped for more out of this class, but any disappointment is more a function of its material and has not much to do with its instructor.  Prof Heiser is knowledgeable and experienced in the subject matter.  Would prefer his applying a little more spice (difficulty) to the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2006<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  His lectures are boring, and you will be tempted to not go to class, BUT, you should go to help your participation grade.  he knows if you're there.  make an effort to ask some questions, and you'll do fine.  Midterm and final are straight foward, just use the study guide.  final project is pretty easy if you put some time into it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2006<br>Class Name: MGMT502<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was painful when I took it. Every night is 3 hours and 15 min. of lecture. Each test took all 3 hours and took him 2-3 weeks to grade.  You also have online quizes weekly which are a PITA.  You also have a paper to do.  The whole thing is just overkill.  He's a nice guy, but just a little too dry if you ask me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2005<br>Class Name: MGT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>doesnt get much better then this guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2005<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Let me first say that the teacher is very interesting and relates much of the material to the real world.  This is a plus.  But there is somthing wrong when you get an A on the Quizes, Midterm, Paper and Final and get a B in the class because class participation.  He lectures from power point.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2005<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Solid teacher who knows his stuff.  Follows a solid syllabus resulting in a structured class.  Allowed me to change the date of the final, he came in on his day-off to allow me to take it.  Midterm and final exams were long, about 3-hrs each.  Overall a good course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2005<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took a month to grade the midterm, took more then 2 weeks to grade the final.  Weighs particpation as much as the midterm or final, which is rediculous.  Powerpoint presentation is meaningless, was better off reading the book and showing up for the exams, rather then going to class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2005<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof is the worst.  I did ok in the class, &quot;B,&quot; but he takes FOREVER to grade.  The midterm was 3 hrs long, and the final was 2.5 hrs.  Also, a final paper was due on the day of the final.  Participation is 20% of the class, and it's hard to participate to Powerpoint slides.  Take another prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked him.  Yes, he uses Powerpoint, but it is effective for this class. Peppers presentations with interesting stories and comments to keep boredom at bay. Knows his stuff.  You won't fool him on anything, but tests are very fair if you study the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2005<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really cool guy, someone who you'd prolly go drinking with. Teaches you very relevant materials for the field. Fair grader. No surprises on tests- everything is off his powerpoints, and problems we go over in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lame teacher. Reads the notes directly from powerpoint. Boring subject. Dont even need to go to class. Is very late on the grading process. Forgets things, decent grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2004<br>Class Name: MGT598<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
