He works in a very demanding and meticulous environment.  This is reflected in his class.  He is a very amiable and organized instructor who takes his work very seriously.  His grading is fair and in my opinion reflects what is expected in the real world. Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2012<br>Class Name: IS444<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class online!
