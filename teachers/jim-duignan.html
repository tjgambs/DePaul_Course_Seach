He was a great teacher, and I learned a lot about teaching students in a creative way.  Yes, he filled the class with a lot of art projects, and sometimes went off on tangents...but I will use this stuff.  Especially if I end up teaching in the younger grades.  Great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2010<br>Class Name: TL418<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Duignan is very nice and generous, but the class is a complete waste of time.  He fills up the entire 3 hours with nonsense that could be accomplished in about 20 min.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: TL418<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof! Class is really fun, and it makes you look at things and think about them differently. I left really excited about teaching and incorporating the ideas he introduced. He also doesn't make you stress about your grade at all, just go and participate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2008<br>Class Name: TL410<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In my opinion this is not a great class; it's more about the art than the education aspect.  He does not make connections to education like I was expecting.  He does want everyone to do well and is an easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2008<br>Class Name: TL201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this man!  He has inspired me beyond what I thought was possible!  I was afraid of art because I thought I was poor at it and he opened the door to many possibilities.  I feel much more confident about my ability to teach art because of him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2008<br>Class Name: TL418<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT teacher.
