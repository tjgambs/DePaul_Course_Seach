    The tests are not as hard as people say, but her grading is all over the place. I don't think she even has a scale, she just randomly assigns grades as she feels between B's and C's. Take someone else and save yourself the headache.  She says that 80% is an A- but that's not true at all. I had about an 85% average and she gave me a B-. Avoid.

    Professor Hillman is great! She is extremely nice and charismatic. She really enjoys teaching and will make herself available to help you at any time. Lectures get a bit draggy, but overall knows the industry and the skills very well.

    This may have been 1 of the most boring classes I have had. She is a nice professor &amp; has a lot of real world stories, but she skims over everything she teaches, &amp; it's all done in her monotone voice. You need to read the book if you want to learn. She curves tests. I would have failed if she hadn't. There is a midterm, final, &amp; group presentation.
