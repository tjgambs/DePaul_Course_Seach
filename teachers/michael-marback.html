I really hope he continues to teach other classes because I look forward to having him in the future.  He cares and will always make time to help you if you put in the effort.  Class can be hard if you don't study.  Follow his tips and you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2015<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  Can be a tad confusing on what is required of you but can always be reached by email.  Very flexible office hours and very patient.  If you have trouble just go and talk to him... its just that simple.   grading criteria is clear and tests are relatively easy if you study what he has taught.  Also teaches great study tips</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2015<br>Class Name: ACC 102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely unorganized and confusing</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2015<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed his class and learned from it. The tests were difficult and you will have to put forth time studying but he did his best to make the class a little fun. Group project was easy, and I hate group projects. He did go off on some random topic at times but mostly kept on track. I would recommend him and take his class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2015<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I actually enjoyed his class. He would go off on some other topic at times during lecture but he made the course somewhat enjoyable, while it can be boring. Tests were kind of tough so you will need to put in the time studying for them. Had one group project which wasn't difficult, a final and midterm. I would recommend but you will have to study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2015<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've never written a review for a teacher before but felt I had to for Mr. Marback. He is hands down the best teacher I've ever had. He's so inspirational, hilarious, and makes learning fun. He wants to see you succeed. He let's you retake tests, but you shouldn't have to because he really prepares you.  I really respect this man. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: 102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I have had at DePaul. Cares about this students more than any teacher I have ever met. Class isn't the easiest and you might have to work for it, but I went from a 77 on the Midterm to a 92 on the final because of his help! I would highly recommend taking his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I never met professor who truly cared about his students as much as professor Marback does. He goes out of his way to help his students understand the material and succeed in professional and personal life. His classes are always fun to attend and they can literally change lives</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Marback is amazing. I came back to the business school and his instruction only made me want to stay. He is extremely intelligent and is able to break down large and dense business concepts into small bits -- you'll ACE the midterm because of it. There are many strategies and acronyms he will supply you with to retain formulas and steps.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't bother buying the book or cengage. Didn't touch it once. Class is easy but don't take it if you are an accounting major. He is unorganized but a really nice guy and wants everyone to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2014<br>Class Name: ACC547<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny guy, good teaching method.

Although, I don't feel like I learned a lot about accounting. It was more memorization. He also liked to postpone quizzes in order to make u study more. Be sure to do really well on midterm & final b/c there aren't a lot of other grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor!! Struggled through accounting 101 but Marback made acc 102 a breeze. Super cool and funny dude. Makes me wanna major in accounting. Would take him again in a heartbeat. Love love love him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the easier accounting 102 classes. He explains everything really well and tells you exactly what is going to be on the quizzes and tests. He's really funny but unorganized. Hes also very helpful outside of class. He gives out his phone number and you can text him or call him for help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marback is the best accounting professor at DePaul. The man is hilarious and his teaching style is excellent. He genuinely cares that his students understand the material. His quizes and exams are also very easy. Take him for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very nice guy and this is the easiest accounting class if you just go to class and pay attention. The example problems he gives you for the quiz are exactly like the quizzes. Easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2013<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seems like a smart and nice professor but his teaching style is outdated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great, funny teacher. A little disorganized but other than that I loved this class. Made a boring subject interesting. After leaving the class I feel like I learned a lot and accounting was explained to me in a way where I completely understand it. Make sure you pay attention to notes and handouts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Your really have to understand some stuff prior to this class, otherwise nothing will make sense. He makes this class more about memorization than understanding the concepts. He is hilarious and makes all these catchy acronyms that really help in the exams. Very easy-going. take him for sure!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2012<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for Auditing 1. Easiest class ever. He gives you bunch of multiple choice to study from and copy pastes the questions on test. If you spend time its the easiest A ever. He is very easy going. People were retaking midterms a week before final. However, he doesn't teach much per se so might haunt you in Auditing II. Ill find out nxt quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2012<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He may have been ok for 102 but avoid for audit....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful and clear of what he wants in exams. Easy weekly quizzes, midterm and final, 2 projects, and passport. Just pay attention to what he says in class, study handouts and sample exams, you will be fine. Do not buy textbook and cengage if you wanna save a lot of money</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great friendly and helpful professor. He gives practice midterms and finals which are almost identical to the actual ones he gives. He is always there to give advice about class or real life. Extremely approachable, and knows the material well. I defiantly recommend him. Class is more about definitions then accounting also if that helps.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He uploads practice quizzes for every chapter on D2L, and gives detailed solution manuals for all of them. Practice midterm and final as well. He is extremely clear, a little goofy which makes the lectures all the more bearable, and is always eager to help struggling students. His class was crucial in my decision to become an accounting major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Marback made ACC102 so easy. I have heard horror stories of this course, and I actually really liked it. He gives practice midterms and finals which really help in studying for the exam! Also, his use of acronyms really makes the material easy to learn. If I had to take another course in ACC, I would definitely take it with him! EASY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2012<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Even when I'm out of his class, he still helps me when I have questions about accounting and finance. Accounting got less complicated with him as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marback is a great professor, I wasn't sure about taking his class because of the comments here but I have to say I'm glad I did. He explains the material well, hands out his own summaries on each chapter (I didn't even read the book), quiz every week, midterm & final. Very easy to understand I didn't even need the book and got an &quot;A+&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy has taught partners of the top four accounting firms. He has credentials and is extremely intelligent. He dumbs down the material for US! For our benefit!! I think he makes this difficult class, squeezed into a short quarter system, much more manageable!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No other Accounting Professor is so involved in his class. It actually disgusts me to read the negative comments, knowing how much Marback cares for his students. Through use of acronyms and real life examples, Marback decodes the complicated language of accounting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is no other Accounting Professor at DePaul that is so involved with his students. Marback tries to decode the difficult language of Accounting (especially as an intro class) through various acronyms/examples. I bet the negative commenters on this page just got a bad grade and can't take the blame themselves. He is a great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Clearest Professor Ive had at Depaul in what was required for the course. ACC102 is one of the more involved courses but his willingness to help when needed makes me wonder how anyone could get less than a B if theyre not aiming for academic probation. Tells exactly what you need for qzs/exms. A+ as Professor, but dont underestimate subject matter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Professor, tells you exactly what to study. If you pay attention during class it is very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>terrible</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not trust the good comments. It is obviously the same person (maybe him) trying to make himself look better. Trust me, he is the worst professor ever and is frankly not knowledgeable at all. Final is impossible. Take someone else. Also avoid Cohen when you get to 305. He's even worse.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't believe people are unhappy with him.  I always know exactly what he's talking about and what he wants from us.  He gives us multiple chances to succeed if we have trouble, but he still makes us know the material.  He makes it easy to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>of course accounting is hard and some people might have been confused by his teaching style but overall good professor. He really wants you to succeed, he just needs to be more clear in how he teaches. He does give you a lot notes , so really study them and you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so involved with the class by always sending handouts, studyguides, emails, etc. because he really wants you to learn. Great professor.  Accouting is not easy but he does what he can to help you succeed. you have to study though, obviously.  Really nice guy and lets you retake quizzes to do better.  Takes feedback seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accounting isn't an easy class, but Marback sure tries to make it easy for his student.  Marback gives about 5 quizzes during the semester and he always passes out a study guide for the quizzes (which are word for word questions that are on the quiz).  I will admit he is all over the place when covering the material but at the end of the day he tie</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher! do not take him. his quizzes are easy but his midterm and final are horrible. do not take him. he is soooo confusing</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him if you want to fail. Take him if u want to laugh at his stupidity. Take him if you don't want to learn anything. Take him if u want to memorize everything and teach yourself rather than learn something. If you take him....good luck....you will need it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>how is this man still teaching at DePaul&#63; he could not teach if his life depended on it. fire him DePaul!!!! he's ruining Accounting students' careers. The man is a joke!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is by far the WORST proffessor at DePaul. He has no idea on how to teach or what he has talking about. It seems hard to believe that this man has a college degree. All he talks about is Warren Buffet. He almost ruined my Accounting career becasue I had to go to Acc 303 and 304 unprepared since i didn't learn a single thing in his class at all!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2010<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst accounting teacher out there. Do not take him. He says the class is &quot;easy&quot; but his midterm and final are impossible. He also says the quizzes and homework do not effect your grade, and they do get counted into your grade. Stay away!</div></div></div></body></html>
