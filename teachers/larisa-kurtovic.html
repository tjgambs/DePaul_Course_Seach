I evolved academically so much after taking her classes.  She does not hold your hand, but she will provide highly constructive criticism.  The key to success in her classes, is to truly apply yourself and not only be present physically but also absorb everything that she offers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2014<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>unnecessarily catty.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2014<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! She really wants you to learn and is always willing to help you with any problems you're having with the course. Just make sure you read or the discussions will be painful!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: INT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're a DePaul INT major you should come to accept painful feedback. It is a rigorous program that really pushes you to your limits. Professor Kurtovic is someone Id recommend taking. She will first tear apart your work, and then guide you into better writing. Dedicated to her students, but don't expect a "positive reinforcement" relationship.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2014<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Larisa is wonderful! She is very knowledgeable and you will definitely learn and see things differently. She cares about students and wants them to learn but will make sure you do your part as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2014<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>She is an incredible professor, definitely take her if you want to be challenged. At first she is very intimidating, but once you get to know her she is very funny and direct, you will enjoy her class if you like to learn and discuss. She will always leave comments and will try to help you improve your work,</div></div></div></body></html>
