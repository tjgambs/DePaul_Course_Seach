She gives awesome assignments and is very hands on with her teaching. As long as you go to class and give an effort on each assignment (about 7 for the quarter in total) you will pass her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2010<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wilber is awesome! She really wants the students to succeed and enjoy the class. She tailored the class to the kinds of things that the students were interested in.  Very fair grader and open to creativity on the papers.  Definitely take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The papers in this class are straight forward. She gives you great feedback if you turn in papers early. The guidelines for the papers are simple and there are only 3 of them. Some of the art I didn't care for but it was still an interesting class for 205. She is highly recommended. Attendance is mandatory like all DePaul classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fair, if not easy, grader. Grade based on three papers (which she will give feedback on before you have to turn them it, guarantees an A), a small &quot;art&quot; project, and participation. Readings were completely unnecessary as they were never a direct topic of discussion. I recommend her, especially if you aren't too into the subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2008<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grading consists mainly of 3 papers with pretty clear guidelines for each in the syllabus. I stopped keeping up with the readings toward the end because she stopped staying on track with the syllabus. However, she was very flexible with due dates if they needed to be extended, & she made herself very accessible to anyone with questions or concerns.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2008<br>Class Name: ART253<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING PROFESSOR! she loves what she teaches and sparks your interest too by presenting material thats relative to anyone. Very easy class too, journal entry every week and a midterm/final paper (both are short, 4-5 pages).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2007<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>overall this class was pretty easy. i skimmed through the readings because she went over them in class. She gives an outline for how to write all of her papers and she grades easy if you follow the outline and have all the necessary info in the papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2007<br>Class Name: ARTSECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is incredibly understanding, helpful, respectful, and overall an amazingly inspirational professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2007<br>Class Name: CLASSSECTION<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A genuinely nice and HELPFUL professor! She's the BEST and ONLY helpful art & design professor in DePaul and more professors should be like her. She's always available and willing to assist you in any way necessary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2007<br>Class Name: ART253<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What an insightful person. Her ideas stem from some sort knowledge bank that I feel few possess. Very sincere about what she teaches, but don't forget, she is there for you there entire time, if you don't understand something. She will take the time to explain EVERYTHING. I can't wait to take her typography class (and every other class she teaches)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2007<br>Class Name: ART393<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My senior design capstone class was the absolute worst class I have taken at DePaul, thanks to Ms. Wilbur.  I would NEVER take her again, and advise everyone I know to do the same.  She is mean spirited and prescribes an ungodly amount of work.  She is terse and uninspiring.  She often scheduled class early, but didn't start for 30 min. I despise h</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2007<br>Class Name: ART253<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, she is very experienced regarding art. She is open minded and listens to what students have to say. She did not use the textbook much, and lectures every class. She is also very helpful with papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2007<br>Class Name: ART253<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady. VERY disorganized though. She ended up being pretty easy, although has potential to be tough. I appreciated how she worked hard to accomodate students. You'll need to go to class because she changes things up a lot and is unpredictable. I hated the graphic design class, but it ended up being an easy grade and Delores is a nice person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: HON202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice lady.  The class was really easy.  I appreciate art a lot more now.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: HON202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I came in to this class kicking and screaming (I draw ugly stick people=) ). She made this class to interesting and really engaged her students. Very smart, very talented, and really knows how to teach and engage an otherwise apathetic student. I had NO respect for artists until I had Prof. Wilbur!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: DESIGN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ONE OF THE BEST MINDS TEACHING AT THIS SCHOOL HANDS DOWN.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2005<br>Class Name: GRAPHICDESIGN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Since graduation, i have realized that dolores is one of the best teachers i ever had. It was hard work, but she has her finger on the pulse and is a great great mentor in design, and in art- one of the best!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2004<br>Class Name: ART261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was probably in the same class as the previous reviewer. She is not very clear at times. Tons of in progress critiques too that seemed to last for days. However, she is a good professor and I don't regret having her as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2004<br>Class Name: ART261<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had dolores for a teacher, on two ocassions. Although she definitely has a great rapport with students, the general consensus of my classmates was that we had no idea what we were supposed to do or learn. An easy A, but not much of a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2004<br>Class Name: HON202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great, great, great, professor. She's definetly not like your standard art professor (i.e not a pompous blowhard idiot). She's smart, engaging, and witty. Definetly take her class!</div></div></div></body></html>
