    She knows what she teaches, maybe to a fault, as lectures are detailed and long.  She is helpful if you need clarification, projects are at least fun.  I was put off by her admiration of Lena Dunham, and her apparent defense of the questionable hobbies.  Her jokes are off-putting, at least to a more conservative student, but overall decent prof.

    Prof. Bronstein is truly the BEST professor I have had throughout my time at DePaul. She provides the most thorough feedback on essays, always presents the most current data, and completely understands media use in teens today! She is always available to help and goes out of her way to make sure you understand! Absolutely amazing professor!

    I LOVEEE this professor! She is incredibly nice, honest, always prepared for class and always willing to lend some extra help if you don't understand something. This is my second class with her and I wish I could have her teach every course of mine. You'll have to work for a good grade but the paper topics are even pretty interesting.

    Love her! Great, kind, funny, and passionate about advertising. She really opened my eyes to a lot of different things. Assignments weren't too hard and were fun and worth the time put into it. She leads a very laid back environment where its easy and interesting to learn and bounce ideas off the class. Highly recommended class and teacher!

    I took her online PRAD 335 class and loved it. She can be really picky in grading the ad analyses, but not in a mean-spirited way by any means. My grades on them only got better once I figured out what she wanted. She is so sweet, helpful, and constructive. I would totally take a class with her again if I wasn't graduating! Highly recommended.

    Professor Bronstein is an amazing woman and tries really hard to teach you as much information as she can in a short amount of time. Papers were challenging to write but she is very clear about what she wants from you. She's very understanding if you have issues. Pretty big group presentation sucks. Overall great class -- HIGHLY recommended!

    She is amazing! Her powerpoints are clear and she is super engaging. She is a bit picky on the ad analysis but offers a lot of help and commentary for the final paper. I would definitely take her again!

    Great teacher! She is so easy to understand and goes out of her way to email the class w/updates. The class is also very interesting and if you go and do the readings you'll be fine. She is also funny and gives a great lecture.

    shes definately not the best prof at depaul but the class was interesting.on more than one occasion i caught her exaggerating the truth in her lectures *please keep in mind she is INCREDIBLY biased &amp; will nit pick ANY ad you put in front of her* the class is one large cynical critique but still intriguing.was pretty lenient with attend.

    Excellent. Took more than one of her grad level courses. Not because I thought they would be easy or that scoring an A would be a sure thing. Simply because I enjoy her classes so much. Amazing teacher.

    A Great teacher- extremely helpful. Class time is very well spent, and I actually felt like I was learning something, and was interested in it at the same time. She is very nice and funny, and will do anything she can to help her students. TAKE HER CLASS!
