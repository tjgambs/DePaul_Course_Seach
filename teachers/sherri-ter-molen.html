A very sweet teacher who encourages participation and really wants to get to know her students. There are 3 quizzes, of which the lowest is dropped and a couple papers and a final. Do the reading, study for quizzes and the final and you'll be fine. She is really great</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: ORG201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>We had a ton of group projects for an online class and it sucks. she seemed sweet and from above ratings it would appear she may be better to take in person. the terms over and she still hasnt graded over 80% of the hw and im not finding out how she grades and a lot of tips i could have used. overall disappointed and annoyed would say take in class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sherri is the SWEETEST professor I've ever had! She is very passionate about intercultural communication and OBSESSED with South Korean culture. There are a lot of group discussions. Class is not difficult if you casually read the book. Sherri is quirky and has a heart of gold. If you have the opportunity, you will not regret taking her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: COM103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sherri is the sweetest woman. Had her for intercultural communications. She is SO passionate about the subject and especially North Korean culture. I learned so much in her class. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my first online class at DePaul. I ended up liking it since I could work on it around my schedule which I guess is the point. There are a lot of assignments but if you are organized then it isn't difficult. A few group projects which weren't bad. Provided quick feedback and responses whenever I had a question. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2012<br>Class Name: COM2010<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had Sherri for Intro to Film at Wayne State. Really pointless class, which I will admit is not her fault. She tries, it's just not an interesting class in anyway and she doesnt make it fun. The semester consists of childish activities and boring movies with one 3 page paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS316<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took CMNS 316 online with Sherri. I took her previously for CMN103 and really enjoy her teaching style. She is a little quirky with her love for Korea and other cultures, but that makes her a fun teacher. Assignments are clear and not hard, but she is a strict grader. Just follow the directions and do the work, you'll get an A.</div></div></div></body></html>
