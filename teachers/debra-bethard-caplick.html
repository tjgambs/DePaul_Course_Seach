She gives lectures supplemented with real world examples and honestly is always available to answer any questions you have. Its a writing class so you do writing, but not just busy work. She actually teaches you how to write for the real world. Definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The beginning of the quarter was rough. It took a while for work to get graded. However, once she did, the feedback was very helpful, and the grades were fair. I also respect her striving to help students get real world experience and preparing them adequately for the PR world. Not many teachers hold values like that. I've learned a lot from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really helpful and gives great lectures. She really wants to help prepare students for the real PR world. When she does get to grading, which does takes a while, her feedback is great. I'd definitely take another class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2014<br>Class Name: PRAD256<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Most unorganised class I have ever taken.  The professor talks about arbitrary things that don't relate to the topic of the class most of the class period. Very bad at informing students of the assignments due and what is expected of in an assignment.</div></div></div></body></html>
