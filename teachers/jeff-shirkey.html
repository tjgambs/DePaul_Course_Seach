He knows his class is a 100 level course meant for requirement filling, and teaches it as such. Don't take it if you want a rigorous course,  but it still has substance and is really interesting. One of those classes  profs where if you put in some effort, turns out great</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2014<br>Class Name: REL143<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of reading, but you don't have to do it to pass the class.

He had such interest in the subject. He cares about his students so much. He always is concerned about how we are doing in the class. I love this teacher! He made class so enjoyable.
