His expectations are very clear, and he let's you know exactly what you need to know for the exam. If you're the type of student that doesn't ever come to class or doesn't expect to try-- then you're in the wrong class (not with the wrong professor). Don't take chemistry classes if you want an easy A. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2014<br>Class Name: CHE230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>O. Chem is not my best or favorite subject, but I loved Dr. Parra's lectures. He makes everything understandable without simply repeating the textbook. Lots of in-class examples. I have also taken Shelby, Carver and Rosenbaum, and he is my favorite of the four. I enjoyed his sense of humor and an honest attitude about the difficulty of the course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: CHE115<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ruben Parra cannot teach. Know this before you take this course. He offers absolutely no help for students trying to understand concepts. If you attempt to ask questions in class, prepare to be ignored. He literally just solves problems in class and explains nothing. That plus he has a VERY thick accent that's impossible to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2012<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely horrible. The format is designed for complete idiots. I still aced the course, but learned next to nothing.

This course in no way facilitates your abilities to comprehend and understand chemistry. Although he engages you, all you do is practice in class (something you should do out of class after learning a concept in class). The format is just too weird for the course so just prepare to make some big adjustments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2011<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy is AWESOME.

Very helpful if you want to actually learn and interact with him in lectures and labs.

It was unbelievable...I mean you basically study for the exam yourself while he attempts to confuse you during class.

He isn't going to hold your hand, but if you're still expecting you should not be here.

I transferred only because I wanted to get away from the crap chemistry program and teachers at DePaul. Don't doubt me, because I am a biochem major at U of I.

In fact, he is probably the most difficult professor I have had, but definitely the most caring. He makes you work so don't take his class if you're trying to skate by college...

Rather, his style of teaching is unorthodox. You need to know what is expected of you. Teacher does not answer questions well though.

Unfortunately, you have to take the class taught by something less than a shrivel of a teacher. Does not explain methods. Does not care about your grade. Does not answer questions well.

He lectures straight from the book, and his tests are very fair and straightforward. It's CHEMISTRY! It's a difficult subject! Do the homework problems, study every day, and go to his office hours if you need any help. You will need to work hard to succeed in this class.

He was ok, I guess. I had him for both CHE 111 and 113. His teaching style focuses on examples rather than concepts, so you'll have to teach yourself concepts at home before tackling the optional (but highly highly HIGHLY recommended) homework problems. The tests are fair and are really not that bad. Just walk into gen chem ready to work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2008<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teaches from the book.

You would do better teaching yourself and only going to class for the review sessions because he basically gives you the test. Horrible attitude toward students and is incredibly defensive about his teaching style.

Trust me, if you want a good grade, don't go to class. Study up on your own. Check his site only for examples. Then study yourself. He will leave you more confused.

The accent wasnt hard to get used to and I wont say dont take him (you kind of have to).But if you do, make sure you know he has his own site instead of blackboard and get test dates and do your own studying. Going to class doesnt help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dr parra is on okay teacher. his exams are not actually very difficult if you study.

It is true that he basically throws it up and expects you to know the subject without. With all the busywork you get in the class, he doesnt.

He's a real nice guy, but unfortunately he doesn't teach very well.

Parra is the only one who teaches these introductory chem classes, so deal with it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2005<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The comment about dr. parra not knowing chemistry was incredibly inaccurate.  It'm a little embarassed for the person who wrote it because clearly they are not informed.  Dr. Parra is an extreemely intelligent person who has done some amazing in his life.  Maybe you should find out more about him before making such false statements!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dont agree with the negative comments on Dr. Parra. He is very nice, grades easy. All you need to do is go to class, do the work, get an A....um hello&#63; thats what college is</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class.  Rough part was that there were 4 grades all quarter.  Prof. Parra encourages students to go to office hours -- go if you have a problem -- it's worth it!  Gives quality notes.  If you put forth the effort, you should do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This Professor is REALLY BAD-I thought that he may be different actually taking the course but I was wrong!!! Like half of the class dropped it. Save yourself time and MONEY and DONT take this class!!!  You will regret it. He is NOT helpful at all even in his office hours.  DePaul needs to FIRE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, but he makes it difficult with his poor grasp of the english language and loads of busywork. Attendence is optional, but I would go because the book sucks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2005<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy sucks, the work load for this basic chem class is insane, i dont think he understands that students have more classes than his crappy chem class. If you like doing tons of work for no reason take this class, otherwise i would advise to avoid this man. 1 more thing his english is terrible</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2005<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>simply put.....do not take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2005<br>Class Name: CHE192<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wasn't clear or helpful even when I went for help.

He posts tests online, and a lot of the questions he gives show up on the exams (verbatim)... so do them!!! This is a difficult course, but Dr. Parra is fair-He curved the exams and the final grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You need to do the practice problems, practice tests and quizzes, and read the book. That's it. Yes, I admit his accent is alittle strong, but if you sit up front, it's not too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOOK AT THE FINAL GUYS IT WAS EASY...ITS ALL THREE OF THE TEST HE HAD CORRECTED AT HOME THEE MAN THROUGH US A BONE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The course is made extremely hard due to the fact that you have to teach yourself the material since Parra is completely inadequate as a teacher.  Lectures and example problems are straight from the book.  The exams are the hardest exams I've ever had in my life.  He acts like he hates his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2004<br>Class Name: CHE133<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had no clue what he was talking about.

He is friendly, and more than easy to talk to. He will do his best to try and make you understand things, but he is slightly limited by the fact that he is too smart for the material and doesn't relate it well to someone who has no clue. If you're not gonna try hard, dont take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>3 test 1 final 1 lab final, very helpful, go to class, sit in front seats to understand, test are just like practice testbanks and practice test. Overall i really like him as a teacher. He knows what he's doing, Plus awesum 10% curves!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's actually a decent teacher, students in his class just dont try. He is a nice man who does good research and is willing to help if you ask. The material is extremely easy, and can easily be mastered. We just have a lot of stupid people in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher! STAY AWAY! easier to teach yourself from the book than having to sit in on one of his really really long and boring lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you put the effort in the class you are almost guarenteed at least a B. He creats practice test that are exactly like the exams.  He does have an accent but is understandable.  If you have questions, stop by his office and he'll answer them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ohh ruben parra a good guy but us students dont really care for that. he is hard to understand b/c of his accent. not good teacher and not bad. make sure you get help outside the class or you wont do real well</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2004<br>Class Name: CHE215<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Did not demonstrate knowledge of the subject matter.
