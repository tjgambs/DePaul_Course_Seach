She's got a background working for Hollywood studios. Pre-production in and of itself is a bit tedious, therefore the assignments for this class are too. But most of the work is done in class. No tests, but pop quizzes are given. Overall all was very easy. She shows movies. Don't need to read</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2014<br>Class Name: DC372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very sweet and cool teacher. Loved her class. Watched hour long shows and just talked about them. Had a few papers to write plus a final paper (5-10 pgs). Pop quizzes here and there but if you were in class you will be fine. Did not mind coming to this class at all. Chose some cool shows! I would recommend her!</div></div></div></body></html>
