She's not even trying to be a good teacher. She basically reads out of the textbook, which I can do on my own. She often doesn't know the answers to basic questions, like will the presentation be in Spanish or English.  She has sapped out my interest in this language.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible. I'm a Spanish minor and wasn't impressed with this prof. She tried to talk me out of studying abroad in Spain because she'd had a bad experience with it. She also fell asleep in class one day. Bad accent, doesn't seem to care, and complains a lot to class. The only thing I got out of the class was the practice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Zeiss was a very good teacher. She helped me become more comfortable speaking spanish to others as well as native speakers. Tests are a little tough, and compositions aren't anything to worry about. Overall this teacher went out of her way to help me as a student and she'd do the same if you show up, do your work, and show some interest</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2009<br>Class Name: SPAN104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not sure I really understand what all the negative reviews are about. Zeiss is a standard professor -- the compositions are a bit challenging, and there is studying involved -- but I had no problems understanding her, and didn't think she was at all overly strict.  She's pretty silly and laidback, actually! No reason to avoid her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this professor! She was great! Everything was straight from the book... we played review games.. and watched movies prior to the test... not that many assignments.. very easy A if you show up and are awake... would def. take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2009<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a terrible professor. She grades incredibly hard on essays,but gives no feedback as to how to make the work better. It was supposed to be a composition class and all we did was watch movies and read poems and then discuss them. Avoid her if possible, she is terrible and kind of rude.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2009<br>Class Name: SPAN104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a horrible professor.  Her accent is bad, she is boring, and grades too hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2009<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE WORST SPANISH TEACHER I HAVE EVER BEEN TAUGHT BY! The coure centers on advanced grammar, yet rarely, if ever, did she ever review the grammar we needed for the tests! I would suggest spending your money on another DePaul professor. Jacqueline Hara was excellent!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2008<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY FROM HER!! You will not learn anything from her. She teaches straigh out the book skipping around the chapter in no kind of order whatsoever. She does no actual TEACHING and expects you to learn it still. LOOK FOR A NEW CLASS IF ITS NOT TOO LATE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Zeiss is incompetent. She may offer help, but it's needed because this composition class was taught from a book that made us read about how to write in Spanish without doing much writing at all.  Her lack of accent is distracting and she doesn't bring any enthusiasm to the subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OH MY LORD! She has to be one of the worst professors I've ever taken.  Speaks with american accent! Annoying and doesn't make class enjoyable at all.  Exams aren't difficult but class is terrible. Made up really ridiculous class exercises, quizzes, and skits that were a waste of time.  Don't take her!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2007<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice person, horrible teacher. Teaches straight from book with no extra notes or examples. Not clear in any instructions. Speaks with NO accent what so ever- SOO annoying! Makes you do skits- waste of class time. Should be teaching high school. I've never felt more lost in a spanish class- and I took 4 yrs in high school! good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2007<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not a good teacher, doesn't explain grammar (or anything else for that matter) very well, tries joking with the class to lighten the mood but doesn't really work, avoid her if possible</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2007<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>cute lil nerd! very fair grader,not easy,but u will get what u deserve for how hard u worked.  teaches class according to what ppl are struggling on. good about promptly grading and handing back hw so you can improve for next paper/quiz. nice that she speaks english as a first language, more clear to teach than teachers with english as 2nd language</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2006<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Beware. Professor Zeiss is unorganized, strict, and her teaching style is too much like how I was taught in H.S. Makes u play the name game first days of class, then threatens a test on each student's name. tests aren't easy cuz she doesn't review well. the four papers are difficult. hard grader. 15 min oral is graded VERY hard. so.. beware.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a new teacher here at DePaul. Okay she comes off as strict at first but she's actually a really cool teacher. She's grades tough on the homework and papers, and a lot of times her explainations of the grammar is confusing. She is available for extra help so don't freak out if it seems tough at first. Try yor hardest and expect a B+/A.</div></div></div></body></html>
