Because of such, the lectures were rather boring and seemed unnecessary. Professor is very knowledgable in the subject, but does a bad job at engaging the class.  Plenty of screenings of shorts and scenes. 5-page research paper as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: ANI206<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super easy class. You can tell she's passionate about the subject. Lectures can drag on a little bit and she's not the greatest with technology. The class itself is incredibly easy, there is no reason you shouldn't get an A. She's a little monotone, but can occasionally be funny. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2014<br>Class Name: ANI207<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Trecka likes what she teaches, and a large part of the class will be watching films. She is a flexible grader, and very friendly and knowledgeable about animation as a subject. Her lectures are short and to the point, and her homework is pretty quick. I'd recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: ANI206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Fun and easy class. Professor Trecka is really easy going and awkward in a funny way. Lets you retake any quiz, always accepts late work and the final is open note. The class is very easy and fun, all you do is watch clips the whole class. Loved this professor, loved this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: ANI206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy class highly recommend. Quizzes are easy you can use your notes on them and on the final. All powerpoints and videos are online just in case you missed it. Shes late at times but she sends you an email about it. She is a nice proffesor, she is an easy grader. You can not fail her class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: ANI206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes late sometimes not always but send an email when she sis. Easy class. Reaction papers usually about 400 words. You can use your notes on quizzes. 5pg paper that i am not looking forward to. Overall excellent class. I remcommend you. All material(powerpint,screenings,videos) are online</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: ANI207<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>useless professor. I am a great student, and got an A in this class, but Prof. Trecka was 20 minutes late every class and many times forgot her ppt presentations. what a joke. her quizzes were matching style, but they never matched up! she obviously didn't care at all. Very disappointing and frustrating. Anime history could have been so awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: ANI206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class. She lets you use notes on the quizzes and the final. Other than that you have to write 4 or 5 reaction papers. They are pretty simple assignments. Theres no way you shouldnt get an A or B. She lets you retake any quizzes if you do bad on them. As for class all you do is watch different animations. Bad thing is research paper!(5pgs)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2009<br>Class Name: ANI206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone saying shes horrible are probably freshmen who want a blow off class. If you really care about your major and even if you don't this class should not be that challenging. Shes is funny and very helpful her quizes are open notes. Just do your reading and show up to class and you will get an A. PS: she also know what shes talking about, no BS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2008<br>Class Name: ANI206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing prof..very down to earth.

She also took time to advise me on things that had nothing to do with the particular class such as my portfolio. She really cares about her students and will make sure you are successful if you put in the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2008<br>Class Name: ANI220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class.

She gave us quizzes while she typed them. Totally unprofessional. Had no idea what is going on. Must not of had a Idea for the final research paper so she started asking the class what we should do. History of Animation. Should be a blow off class but she makes it horrible. BE AWARE HER INEXPERIENCE MAY GET YOU A BAD GRADE!</div></div></div></body></html>
