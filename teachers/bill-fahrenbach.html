Sometimes picky about grading and grades each student differently which has its advantages and disadvantages. Runs class as a discussion, so be prepared to participate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2011<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't find him as mean as others on the reviews, but he is certainly dry. He can be a friendly person, he just is not a scintillating speaker and the classes were sometimes boring. But I read things that I liked and we talked about them. I Don't really ask for much more than that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2011<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Fahrenbach is one of my favorite teachers in the English department. The novels and short stories we read in this class were all really interesting. He challenged me as a writer and changed the way I think about writing (In a good way)! Tough grader, but this motivated me. He's sweet, hilarious, and a really cool guy. Recommend him 100%.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: ENG311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, really&#63; Fahrenbach is definitely NOT that bad. It is true he has quite the monotone, but I have never noticed him being rude or condescending.  His grade calculation system in regards to writing assignments is excellent, and he always comes to class with a positive attitude.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2010<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't understand all the negative comments. I thought he was a great professor. He definitely knows what he's talking about. He respected the different viewpoints and comments. My only negative comment is I had a hard time hearing him sometimes. I'd definitely take another class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2010<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously... I really can't believe that this dude was hired. He has never said anything that I find remotely enlightening, he drags on and mumbles constantly, and best of all, he is extremely rude! He constantly cuts students off and is horribly condescending. Good luck staying awake through an utterly mind-numbing hour and a half or pure boredom.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was horrible! He is terribly rude and will cut people off when they are sharing their opinions. He is disrespectful and dry. This class made me second guess my major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2009<br>Class Name: ENG310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't believe there are so many negative reviews here! I I really enjoyed his class. Fahrenbach teaches to the kids that do the reading and, in some instances, it may only be a couple. I've always found him to be extremely helpful and clear (assuming you actually did the assignment). Oh, and what is the deal with the post from 20 years back&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2009<br>Class Name: ENG305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THUMBS DOWN, QUIT YOUR JOB NOW!~!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2009<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy's still alive!&#63;  A bag of cement could probably teach a better class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2009<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If this guy is as inept at life as he is at teaching then he's an even bigger epic fail than first impressions would lead you to believe. Since Fahrenbach is CLEARLY the smartest guy ever his spiteful and resentful 1st impression of YOU is all that matters and he makes no effort to mask his disdain.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2008<br>Class Name: ENG320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bill Fahrenbach's mushy stare pierces your soul as you struggle to stay awake. He's the dept. head which makes him a big wheel in the English building so if you see him give him a high five, he really gets a charge out of it and you can watch as he moonwalks all the way back to his office (but not before dancing a lively jig) it gives him a charge!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2008<br>Class Name: ENG370<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It seems like a lot of the comments on here are negative, but I really  liked my experience in his class.  He's dull sometimes, but I think that's more the nature of the material than Fahrenbach himself.  He was easy to talk to, and presented the material well... although in a very traditional &quot;lecture and notes&quot; kind of way.  Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: ENG370<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very respectful of students and highly inteliigent. While he can be dry at times, he is always open for questions and welcomes class participation.  He also responds to emails right away.  I am taking him again this quarter; I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2007<br>Class Name: ENG400<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had this teacher years ago, and it is not a pleasant memory.  While he is intelligent, he lacks delivery skills, and is disorganized.  Assignments are unclear (he did not provide us with assignment sheets or directions), and lectures are dry.  Has an arrogant attitude outside the classroom.  Clearly more interested in research.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG270<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice enough guy and a fair teacher, but man is her boring.  He also says essentially after every 3-4 words.  My advice is to get extremely caffeinated before taking his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2006<br>Class Name: ENG105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took his class a while ago and I remember it being terrible. I agree with most people that he knew what he was teaching but you seriously feel as if you're a 13yr old in middle school.  His classes dragged pointlessly and it was NOT interesting at the least.  I had no idea what he wanted out of papers even after consulting him about it many times</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2006<br>Class Name: ENGLISH120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was at a student at DePaul 20 years ago and still can't believe this guy is teaching. He's very boring, hard to understand, not approachable and does not care. It's interesting how current students here see the same things I did 20 years ago.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: ENG270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't believe he has received any negative ratings.  He was very respectful of our time, didn't assign anything that wasn't pertinent to the class, extremely intelligent even if he can go off on a tangent.  Would definitely take a class with him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: MEDLIT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had Hist of the Eng lang &sen sem w/ him. I wouldn't pass him up just b/c he lacks a streak of outspoken youthful rebellion.He is a profound intellectual and if you actually put your tuition dollars to use and lend him your ear,he'll return the favor w/ a plethora of passion and info.Great man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2004<br>Class Name: GRAD<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very intelligent man, yet the material in the course is extremely boring.

Let's see...doesn't remember the stories we read for class; no respect for students; doesn't listen to anything other than his own incessant rambling.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2004<br>Class Name: ENG4006<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgable and helpful.

Ridiculously boring and just plain unintelligent.  I can't believe he is the department head--makes me want to leave DePaul.  (On the other hand, I feel kinda bad for him--he seems really depressed.)</div></div></div></body></html>
