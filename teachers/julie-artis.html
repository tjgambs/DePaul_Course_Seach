However, Julie does know what she is doing.  It was annoying when she wasn't sure how to use the new Microsoft Office Suite? isn't that what she'd paid to teach&#63;  She is bad at email, which is always annoying, but other than that, she wasn't bad.  Very lenient about late work, which rocks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: MAT242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice woman.Extremely helpful, class isn't hard at all, and if you're lucky you'll even have a tutor in your class always available.I'm a math person, so it's a bit easier for me, but honestly not hard.Go to class, pay attention, and you'll do perfectly fine.

It's obviously a reguired class, but you won't use any of the stuff that we learned again. Artis is one of those teachers who crams new material the day before the exam and doesnt feel like she did her job until u learn as much as possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: SOC279<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's really nice and explaines content well.  homework assignments are not easy, but the tests are not too bad.  she's really understanding and very fair.  stats is not the greatest class, but she made it fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she knows her stuff and she is really good at explaining things and helping out in and out of class. she is a really hard grader and her final was so hard but i still feel like i learned a lot. a lot of work in this class too but as a prof she's cool</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2004<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers i've had so far!
