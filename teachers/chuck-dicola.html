His instructions are everywhere but its too much and often times they do not always mirror each other. Be prepared to do a ton of clicking back and forth to make sure you completed everything required. He has no presence in online discussions, which I feel is essential </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2014<br>Class Name: AI185<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>I took him for his online Beatles class.  I didn't even like the Beatles, and made that clear to him through my journals, but I loved reading his feedback.  I feel like if you show you're relatively interested, you'll get along ok.  Journals are pretty easy, just connect with the readings.  He seemed easy to reach out to with emails.  Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2014<br>Class Name: L5A5<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Chuck is a great professor with high expectations and states them up front.  As long as you read what they are;seek clarity if you don't understand, you will be successful in his courses. I look forward to any upcoming courses he will teach; I appreciate his involvement with the class and his standards of excellence; worthwhile learning experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2014<br>Class Name: BEATLES<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor grades subjectively to how much time you spend on his D2l page. not based on papers, assignments, discussions, etc. He assigns steep penalties if your assignments are even 20 mins late. Gives scant comments. Terrible professor. DO NOT TAKE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2014<br>Class Name: AI185<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Online Professor!  Took him for a class on The Beatles - he's very clear about what needs to be done, and always sends out reminder emails at the start of the week.  Weekly journals (1-2 pages) and a discussion.  Midterm and Finals depend on if you are in DePaul SNL or as an elective.  Very nice teacher, really enjoys discussing The Beatles!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2012<br>Class Name: CRIT201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2010<br>Class Name: CRIT155<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not bother with this instructor.

There were MANY papers that seemed to be just spitting back facts and what he wanted to hear. Very knowledgable, but needs to work on his communication & people skills. For an adult geared program he seems out of touch with what the requirements of the school & program are</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/24/2007<br>Class Name: POLITSECT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not friendly, unclear about the assignments. Unfair with his grading system. The entire class received C's & D's and we were all confused about the assignments. Talk down to students. I hope he'll change.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/15/2007<br>Class Name: CRITTHNK<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Assignments are not clear - kept changing throughout quarter - even between classes.
