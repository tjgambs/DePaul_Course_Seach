But he needs to understand that he's teaching different groups of students. People come from various backgrounds, he can't just give an outline about the subject. Just because we are graduate students doesn't mean we have super powers to figure everything out. Not worth!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2015<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is just to high of an expectation from him, he is a really harsh grader. If you have more than one other course or a job I would take the other professors who teach this course they are much easier. I would not take him again, made me want to avoid the world of database design.  His exams are rough and the homework take an expected 20 hrs/wk.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2015<br>Class Name: 455<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He always said:" you guys are graduate student, which means you have the ability to search answer by yourself"  Then, Why I paid for the class? Just google everything. He always threaten students by giving an F or smash their phone if you use it in class or exam.  Wasting of time and money on this course even I can get A which means nothing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2015<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>You should know that you are a graduate student  before taking his class. Usually, he doesn't give you answers clearly but just give you a bits of hints to find the solution. Not easy to do his hws if you compared with other professors in the same class. The most important thing is u need to show your effort then u can get what you deserve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: CSC455<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is qualified to this class, but not a really nice professor. His exam will be based on homework, so it is not too hard for me.  In brief, the great thing is that you can learn some new stuff in his class, but the worst thing is that he seems not really patient.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2014<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not be fooled by some of these reviews. The guy is really cool. He will lay down the law to you making him seem very strict and difficult the first day, but definitely isn't. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO is understand the subject and do the assignments right and turn them in timely. Exams are almost carbon copies of assignments. Easy A if you do your work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2013<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guys mid terms and finals are HARD AS HELL! His homework is easy. His finals have fill in the blank questions. Seriously, who remembers all the technical computer terms without a word bank? And his final project was hard. Cool guy but his finals are too hard for an easy database class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2013<br>Class Name: CSC309<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I read the other reviews from this site and thought it doesn't look that bad, I was wrong. This guy is horrible. Don't do it, take another professor, not helpful and rambles on about incoherent things. Basically had to read the book and ask for a lot help from my friends. I wanted to learn the material but this guy was worthless, find someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2013<br>Class Name: CSC309<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He grades everything too intensely. He has a good knowledge of programming but is very outdated and does not understand a lot of concepts. He likes to tell history stories about computer science, funny enough though, he's only half right about it. Overall just don't take him. Boring and doesn't know much except his very narrow scope of Comp Sci.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2013<br>Class Name: CSC309<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Homework is tough, but manageable. Exams are even tougher. Exam problems are similar to that of the homework, so if the homework took you 10 hours to finish, you need to practice until you can do the homework problems within an hour. He will not test you on small programming nuances, just the skills needed for the homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2012<br>Class Name: CSC262<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class online and it was challenging, but I learned a lot. I would recommend taking the in class section if your schedule allows, but this is a great class for people who are very busy because his homework policy is relaxed and you can turn in an assignment 2 weeks late with only 2 points off. Look out for assignment 5, it is long.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2012<br>Class Name: CSC262<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class started out alright and the homework wasn't too bad, but the homework gets progressively harder and at this point (after the mid-term) we are covering material from his CSC309 class which is way too challenging for a C   2 course. Avoid this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2011<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>try not to take with him, he never explain his homework and his exams are hard.don't take him never.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2011<br>Class Name: CSC309<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't go over any homework and the grader sucked. They took off points for everything and it was all or nothing so if any small mistake could result in a 0. Bottom line... Don't take him if you can avoid it. He tells good stories about computer science but doesn't actually teach you anything about computer science.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: CSC309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>David's the man I thought his exams were kind of tough and the pace of the course was pretty fast but he's ready at a moment's notice to help you every step of the way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2011<br>Class Name: CSC309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher is funny and very helpful. Always available before class to help you. He keeps the course interesting and has many stories to tell about his work and academic experiences. If you have to take Object Oriented Programming in C++, TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2009<br>Class Name: CSC262<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Having a prof who currently works in the industry is great. He teaches real world standards, not textbook standards. Exams are reasonably challenging but are graded fairly. If you study there is no reason you won't do well (I got 100% on midterm by studying 1 hour a night). He tells you what he expects, and takes exam questions straight from HW.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2009<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. I was in the same class as the person who said it was impossible to get an A, and I easily got an A with no prior programming experience.  It's not his job to be nice to you, it's his job to teach you how to program, which he does extremely well. You just have to do the work and ask for help when you need it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2009<br>Class Name: CSC261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof! I knew nothing about programming before this class and I understood immediately. He wants to make sure you understand to the point where things can get slow. He takes points off for little things like indenting, but he's totally there to help! Will even meet with you on weekends.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2008<br>Class Name: IS549<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He will not hold your hand or baby you through the course.  You have to work and earn your grade.  Overall he is a fair grader.  He fired his grader & our first homework took a long time to get graded.  Easily accessible via email after hours.  He was funny and entertaining.  I am an online student and felt as I was part of the class.  Pretty good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher, some of the concepts were a bit tricky to understand at first, but overall he does everything he can to help you out. Very nice guy and very fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolute Jerk, not very understanding, hard to get in contact with, takes forever to respond to an email, do not take esp if you were thinking about doing it for an online class he will not grade your homework if your final is scheduled before the class final. Gave no real help for doing the final or an example not a great prof for online students</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2008<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is no hands-on work at all in this class until a final project.  The class lecture merely covers theory, and then you are expected to apply that theory in a final project.  His explanations are not clear, and I have learned more by simply reading the book and Googling things I don't understand yet.  I would not recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2008<br>Class Name: IT212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>David does not give any breaks. He makes you work for your grade and even goes beyond the assigned work (and puts the extra on his exams.) His tests involve writing the code in pencil, without the assistance of an editor. I found this challenging. Very fair grader - very helpful after-hours</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2007<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A good professor who taught a difficult subject and was able to capture the attention of the class.  Although the subject/homework where challenging, the matter in which it was taught was above average</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2006<br>Class Name: CSC452<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough class. Homework wasn't too bad, but you had better like programming, or be able to suffer through programming (for those of you non-programmers). Tests were challenging, but just like the homework. Overall, a fun class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2006<br>Class Name: IS375<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very nice professor who taught a difficult subject well.

Depaul even gave me a full refund so I have no axe to grind.</div></div></div></body></html>
