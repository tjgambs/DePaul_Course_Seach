Although, there is so many readings and if you don't take notes don't expect to get an A or B on the exams.  But hes awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2015<br>Class Name: 205301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an amazing professor but there is a lot of reading. You do the reading and take really good notes in class you'll get an A. It's very time consuming.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2015<br>Class Name: 262<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Professor Maguire for Catholicism and World History at DePaul. He's a little soft spoken but very passionate about class. Lectures are helpful and he outlines specifics you must know. Three tests and one paper. Participation is not required, but shows you care. Lots of reading, though it is very interesting. Take him - he's engaging.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/15/2014<br>Class Name: CTH205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Maguire does NOT have a boring lecture!!! He is smart, helpful, understanding and sometimes even funny! I highly recommend his class even if you are not interested in history because he MAKES it interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2014<br>Class Name: HISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Omg, class is so boring. I wanted to cry my eyes out! You need to attend class because he covers alot of material! tests arent so bad if you really study a day before. Seriously boring! but probs going toget a decent grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: REL214<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Maguire covers a LOT of material each class. Take good notes, and pay attention. He did a good job during lecture, but because the course required students to cover so much, it was a difficult class. I did learn a lot, and it was interesting. Just be prepared for a lot of reading. There are also reading quizzes, a final, and two papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2013<br>Class Name: CTH206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down the most knowledgable history teacher I have encountered thus far. Clear, thorough, and enthusiastic on the topic while simultaneously being an extremely helpful and understanding professor. Any student would be lucky to get a seat in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2013<br>Class Name: CTA180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor ever, be prepared to read but if you want to learn, he's the man. He is an asset to DePaul and any student lucky enough to encounter him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2013<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Maguire has a very boring lecture, a lot of reading, and a moderately challenging midterm/final paper and test. I received an A but had to work with it. Along with this I would like to say that I learned a lot in class, and Maguire is a very respectful, courteous and all around nice guy. If you have interest in the topic, take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2013<br>Class Name: HST173<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Magurie is hands down the best teacher I've ever had. Yes, his class is challenging but he is quick to respond to emails and very helpful. A combination of his knowledge about everything related to modern European history the fact that he speaks at least two other languages makes his class fascinating. Highly recommend taking his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2013<br>Class Name: HST271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows everything, is passionate about the subject, and is incredibly helpful if you just ask. Yes, as others have noted, he's quiet.  So sit up front, or listen more carefully.  I've never learned so much, or been so interested, in any other history class.  He's one of the best professors in the department.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2013<br>Class Name: CTH354<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Maguire is quiet at first but is a kind and helpful teacher. Don't be afraid to ask questions during or after class, he's super helpful if you ask. Pay attention, read, and take notes, and you'll get a ton out of his classes. He's really smart and has a lot to share.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2013<br>Class Name: HST271<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Heavy lecture based, welcomes interruptions for questions. If you do not ask questions to clarify your confusion, you will get lost; he covers a lot of material in a short amount of time. If you love French history, take the class. Do not take just for teacher though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2013<br>Class Name: HST206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Maguire is my favorite history teacher.  Although a bit boring, I learned so much and remembered it.  I have taken his classes twice before! I got an A in both classes, and I did not find his grading too hard at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2012<br>Class Name: CTH244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did not enjoy this class because i thought it would be an actual debate about the existence of God. It turned out to be a boring class with alot of reading. The professor is very knowledgeable but his delivery tends to be boring and does not engage you. It is interesting but it was not what i expected. I passed it but learned nothing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2012<br>Class Name: REL200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the worst professor ever! He whispers, doesn't help you when you need it. Talks way too fast, doesn't write notes on board. DON"T EVER TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2012<br>Class Name: CTH206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought Prof. Maguire was really good-he knew an INSANE amount about Catholic history, and just basic history of the world. His grading was very fair....can get a bit boring at times. MUST go to class, homework was all reading, but not that much. I love him, he's clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about his studies. I recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2011<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So, I took intro to cath because i am catholic and thought it would be easy. All you do in this class is READ! we read about 60-75 pages before each class, plus chapters from the gospel of matthew. I could hardly keep my eyes open in class. He whispers. Reading quizzes every class. oral midterm, ID final, 2 papers. this is the worst class DONT TAKE</div></div></div></body></html>
