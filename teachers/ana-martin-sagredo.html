Many times during class, however, it was almost impossible to understand her speaking. I've gotten As in my other spanish courses but I and most people in the class struggled with this course.  I would not recommend. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2010<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sagredo is a very fluent Spanish speaker who comes from Spain. She makes Spanish easy to understand and her tests are relatively easy if you study. Do your homework, pay attention in class, study for the tests, and you'll get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2010<br>Class Name: SPN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ana is a great teacher.
