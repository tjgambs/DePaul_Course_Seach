My advice, GO TO CLASS, RECORD LECTURES, take notes on a computer or print slides. When studying make note cards DO NOT READ chapters in book, only use to clarify or get a bit more detail. Her PPTS have enough detail. You can easily get a B if you put in effort. Lab quiz every week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: BIO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I looked forward to going to Dr. Brooke's lectures.  She is very passionate about what she teaches.  Also, she is genuinely concerned about her students' progress in the class.  But beware!  You MUST print out the lectures ahead of time because she adds a lot to her lectures.  Show up to class and be ready to study for every lab quiz and test!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2014<br>Class Name: BIO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>A M A Z I N G!!! Dr. Brooke was the best bio professor! She's so clear with what she teaches, and if she sees that you are struggling she will try to meet with you 1 on 1 to help you out.  She goes to each lab with you to help you understand the material as well.  Shes literally, amazing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2014<br>Class Name: BIO220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Like everyone else said, Dr. Brooke will challenge you but it's worth it. She expects a lot of you but she's a fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2013<br>Class Name: BIO210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is requires a lot of work. But if you put in the time this class will be very rewarding. Dr. Brooke is very straight forward with her lecture material and what is going to be on the test, which is basically everything. Bring the power points to class because she talks really fast. Overall a good experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2013<br>Class Name: BIO220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Brooke is by far my favorite professor at DePaul. She is very difficult, however, I have seen that I have learned the most from her. This was my second course with her, and I definitely look forward to her other classes. She expects a lot but you also get a lot out of the course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2013<br>Class Name: BIO210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not easy, but it's worth it! You need to put time into it, but it was definitely one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Depaul as a bio major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: BIO220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is completely unrealistic in her expectations in her students. This class is all memorization but beware: Brooke hardly posts anything but the slides on d2l. All the labs are passed out in class so if you miss lecture, you don't have the materials for lab. Also, assigned presentation on Tuesday....due in 2 days on Thursday. Terrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2012<br>Class Name: BIO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First exam was tough but she adjusts accordingly. You will work harder than some classes, definitely not bad at all. She's a wonderful person, get to know her. She really cares about her students and wants you to learn. One of the best professors at depaul. If you can't handle a tough class rethink your major or look inside and fix that work ethic</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2012<br>Class Name: BIO210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's super intense and intimidating. She doesn't curve anything and makes everything super challenging. Half of the class dropped or failed. Definitely not one of my favorites at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: BIO347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Brooke is simply incredible. It was an honor to take this course with her. Medical Bacteriology is not an easy topic, but she made it so compelling that it was hard not to care about the material. She was always available to meet with you for extra help, and continually encouraged you to try harder and learn more. I am so grateful for her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2011<br>Class Name: BIO210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Brooke is by far on of my favorite Biology professors at DePaul. I had her for both 101 and 210. Were they hard&#63; Definitely challenging, not impossible. I still had a social life. There is a lot of material. But if you put in the time to study and understand what types of questions she is going to be asking an A is definately possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: BIO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is awesome. She can come off as intense at first, but she is actually a very nice person. Her classes are tough. But, she is an excellent communicator. If you are looking for an easy A, this is not the class for you. But, if you want to really learn some stuff about Biology, she is the best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2010<br>Class Name: BIO220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. If you are into Biotech, you need to consult her for advice. VERY helpful. Look at the ratings.. usually when people have hard classes, they blame it on the professor and rate accordingly.. her classes were on the hard side, but she is still adored. Rock on Dr. Brooke!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2010<br>Class Name: BIO220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay Away!  Class is much harder than 200level.

Her powerpoint notes are extremely helpful. Don't miss the lecture.It's a hard subject without her notes I wouldn't have understood it.I read the first few chapters in the book b4 i deemed the book useless.
