Take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2011<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never taken a class with a professor who seemed less interested in the success of her students. When I made appointments to get help outside of class, she was always very condescending. DC 125 was way too hard for an intro class.  Think twice before taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2011<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awful teacher. She is very arrogant, and the class title was very misleading.  I took this class hoping to learn more about photography, but instead all we did was mess with photoshop.  The class was boring; everyone was on facebook the whole time.  We never used either of the two books that were &quot;required.&quot;  A complete waste of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2011<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE DO NOT TAKE HER! I WAS VERY EXCITED TO TAKE THIS BECAUSE I WAS ASSUMING THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE FUN..WRONG!!! SHE IS SO RUDE AND THINKS HER STUFF DONT STINK...ANYWAYS DONT TAKE HER..I HAD TO DROP THIS CLASS BC I FELT THAT I WAS GOING TO FAIL BC I FELT LOST IN THE CLASS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2011<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>all these bad comments are OBVIOUSLY written by the same person.DO NOT BE MISLED,NOT A WORD IS TRUE.She is awesome!!!!and not hard at all!! due dates CANNOT BE ANY CLEARER...ps.it's a Digital Photography class, not a cell-phone-camera-last-minute-photoshoot.if u r too lazy to use a real camera then dont waste ur professor's time and then complain!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2011<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the worst teacher I have ever had. I thought photography was going to be fun, but it is the hardest class I have ever taken. My entire class is so lost every day. She assigns projects without being clear of due dates or makes it due the very next day. DO NOT TAKE HER!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2011<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD. She doesn't tell you when anything is due, and doesn't explain what is due clearly.  When she is demonstrating in class and you are trying to follow along on your computer, she says that the 'clicking' distracts her, so then everyone gets lost. She has a bad attitude, and isn't accepting of questions. awful teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2011<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was very disappointed in this teacher. She goes way too fast in class. She is not a fair grader and she doesn't seem to care about her students. I worked very hard in her class and did not receive the grade i deserved. I WOULD NOT recommend anyone to take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2011<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chelsea Goodwin is by far one of the worst professors I have ever had. She expects you to know everything about the photography software and never mentions due dates. She goes through class way to fast and when you ask questions she is stuck up and looks down on you. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLASS. She honestly shouldn't be able to teach. I hate her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2010<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i dont know what 8/22/10's problem is, but prof.goodwin is awesome! she is young, always smiling and friendly, very helpful--if she critiques your work, it's only for your own good, it's what photographers do! class is NOTTT stressful. Take her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2010<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Goodwin's class was very stressful.  I had to spend more time working on the projects for this class than I did on homework for my 300 level major classes.  Don't expect to skate by with prof. goodwin.  She also does not tell you due dates far in advance and can be difficult to reach by e-mail.</div></div></div></body></html>
