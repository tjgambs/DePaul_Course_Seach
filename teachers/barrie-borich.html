She knows what she's talking about. She grades fairly/on the easy side. She assigns a lot of reading but then the "quizzes on the reading" are super basic so that's kind of annoying. She likes participation. I personally didn't enjoy the content, but as a teacher she's great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2014<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting teacher if you like the subject. I was mislead on the class and it ended up being about going green. I have no interest in this subject so I did not enjoy the class. She is always willing to help and is clear on assignments. </div></div></div></body></html>
