    One of the nicest, funniest, best teachers I've had at DePaul. Course was very easy and she walked you through step by step. She does know the material very well and would rather teach in person than have hard tests or hw.She also runs her own PR firm, so get to know her if your a PRAD student. Highly Recommended!
