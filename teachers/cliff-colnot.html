This man is petty, insecure, and conniving and crosses the boundary of what is professional. Having worked with some of the most esteemed conductors (constructive, positive, and empowering) I cannot grant this man any respect- given the belittling way he treats his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2005<br>Class Name: ORCHESTRA<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A smart guy, but not the god he thinks he is.  If you enjoy a world of sick politics and pettiness through email as well as a &quot;my way is the only way&quot; mentality, I highly, highly recommend this skillful professor.
