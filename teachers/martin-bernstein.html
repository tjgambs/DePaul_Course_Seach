I feel like I did not learn very well in this class. He goes really slow through the easy things and speeds through new material. He'll help if you ask, but once he starts talking he doesn't stop and class time gets wasted. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: DC220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Spends most of the class time talking about nonsense, and when he does actually teach something, it's all rushed towards the end so that no one can understand how to do anything. He also tells us not to do online quizzes, then gives us a 0 on it for not doing it. Avoid at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2013<br>Class Name: DC220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marty is very cool! You use Adobe Premiere Pro and have several editing projects (action, dialogue, PSA). The issue is that they don't give out codes for the program, you need to come and work on the projects in school cause all the computers have the software. Sometimes he goes fast but he'll slow down and repeat when asked. I'd recommend him!</div></div></div></body></html>
