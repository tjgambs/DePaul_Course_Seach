Tom is one of the best teachers I've had at DePaul. He is very clear on grading and assignments, is ALWAYS willing to help you if you need it, and is so nice and makes the classroom atmosphere so enjoyable. Don't ever skip the chance to have him as a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2013<br>Class Name: LSP320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, really helpful. Lots of readings, and you have to post reflections/reading notes on D2L which can be frustrating.
