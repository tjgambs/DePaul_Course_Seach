He has a masters degree..not even in a PHD program. And we pay for it.  You figure it out! Thanks History department!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2004<br>Class Name: WORLDHST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy ... on the eyes, on the brain and all of that. It helps when the professor actually has a life outside of teaching, which Tafel does.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2004<br>Class Name: WORLDHST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very passionate about what he teaches.  Easy to talk to and relate with whether it's class stuff or life and he's available outside of class.  Oh and he's super hot and a total renaissance man man.  Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2004<br>Class Name: HIS218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is nothing major to do just read the chapters. Gives you everthing for the exams, so if you study that no problem getting an A. Oh there is one paper, your source is the only the text.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2004<br>Class Name: HIST<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If i was a History major, I probably wouldn't like him. But if you just need to fulfill your liberal studies requirement, he knows his stuff and is really nice. It was creepy that he looks exactly like my friend's ex boyfriend though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2004<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very cute~has a passion for history and knows his stuff.

He knows the contents of the books like the back of his hands.  The cool thing about this proffesor is that he is very humane, empathetic and easy going.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2004<br>Class Name: HIST218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everything is so clear.  No HW, just assigned reading.  The textbooks are asy and clear to follow.  Prof. Tafel explains in an easy-to-understand story kinda mode.  Midterm and Final are discussed a lot prior to taking them.  Great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2004<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2003<br>Class Name: HST218<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an easy professor but a complete waste of time. Sure he's cute but I thought he was mediocre as a professor at best. He is hard to get ahold of and showed up to class late many times. I would not take another class with him. DePaul has better profs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2003<br>Class Name: HIST218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Michael Tafel is so freakin hot!
