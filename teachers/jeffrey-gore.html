He expected too much of us, treating the class like it was far more advanced than it actually was. A LOT OF WORK. Be warned.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2009<br>Class Name: ENG260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him for Lit research... if you don't want to work hard or read A LOT!!! Don't take him. I transfered to his class hence I missed two class periods and he counted me absent for those two days... yea. He sticks very close to his schedule, will cut you down and find out if you haven't done your reading. leaned a lot though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher...will call u out if u miss class/dont do reading</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2009<br>Class Name: ENG270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was somewhat difficult, but Gore is really helpful and a nice guy.  You get introduced to a pretty wide variety of theory and specialize in one.  Do the readings and think about your papers and you should be fine.</div></div></div></body></html>
