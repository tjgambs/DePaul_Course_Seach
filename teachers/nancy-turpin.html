Turpin is not the type who you will be engaged in class. Often, she gives vague instructions for the essay and she criticized how she said if I ever written an English paper. She also went too deep in history that is not relevant to food politics. Avoid at all cost.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2015<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's the most boring teacher I've ever had. All she does is ramble on about history and I took her focal point class. She's cute and sweet but is boring as hell. She gives long reading and writing assignments. Requires a lot of books that you only read a few chapters from. I sat on my computer the whole time and passed with an A. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2015<br>Class Name: 33314<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's an amazing person, but not teacher. Her lectures are boring and she goes on about history in a food politics class. Very boring and monotoned. She's really sweet and cares for what she does. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2015<br>Class Name: HST172<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was very kind and had infinite knowledge on the subject taught. The class was easy because she did not assign any petty assignments-- only papers never exceeding three pages and all the information on the topics are in your book. If you follow her guidelines, you will get a good grade (easy AB for students). Loved this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2011<br>Class Name: HISTO236<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most boring teacher. Worst class i've taken so far in college. Papers are impossible to write cause she gives no guidelines. The readings are boring and if your not a history major, do not take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2010<br>Class Name: HIST173<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE, I was a 4.0 student before her class where I got a B-. You write essays on readings where you create your own thesis and she grades them impossible. I even had a meeting with her to discuss it where she told me it was terrible and I somehow wrote on the wrong topic. And lastly, she is so boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2010<br>Class Name: HST173<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The longest hour and a half of my week. She is knowledgeable but doesn't seem to talk anything about relevant to the class. Her grading is weird and wrong: pick 10papers at random, grade them, then compare the rest of the papers to them. Made me change my major from History; kind of ruined it for me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: HST173<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have no idea why people say she is horrible and a hard grader. I hardly ever did my readings before class and I got a solid A. If you participate, take notes on the board, and jot down the main points she talks about for the weekly question you will be fine. Good class, good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: HST173<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Turpin is extrememly boring, however i have no idea what people are talking about when they say she is a tough grader.  I got a A- in the class and it wasnt that hard.  lots of reading, with two papers, a essay mid term and a take home final.  not the best teacher ever, but managable</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her classes are primarily based on class discussions, but if nobody talks it get very boring because she talks about random things from readings.  She grades extremely hard on her two big essays.  She is extremely nice though and loves history.  Don't be to afraid to take her its just a lot work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2008<br>Class Name: HST173<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a waste of time.  There was no structure whatsoever as she'd get on tangents most of the time.  However, if you know how to write and are willing to read what's needed you should be ok.  She gives you enough &quot;extra&quot; assignments to help your grade if you mess it up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was very unhappy with Nancy Turpin's grading methods. As mentioned before, I also believe that she grades based on her values. I am an intelligent student and a good writer, but I received a below an 80% on two important papers. Also, her class has no structure. I do not recommend taking a class from this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: HST173<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nancy Turpin, despite what many of my classmates say, is an excellent teacher.  Although she doesn't teach in class, her class is still easy and if you have any idea how to write a paper, you will do fine in her class.  She doesn't give any tests and it is very easy to get at least a B in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2008<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have written many papers, never recieved lower than an A (I have 3.9 GPA, i'm good in school). Her class is first time I have gotten back TWO papers under 78%!! Her grading is illogical and no one has any idea what she wants or looks for. No one recieves higher than a C or low B on papers. Enthusiastic about class, but grades unrealistically.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2008<br>Class Name: HST173<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible.  She assigns tons of reading and doesn't even lecture in a way that you can take notes.  She's refused me for office hours and is senile.  She grades harshly on all papers, but does not give you advice on how she wants them written.  I love history, but this professor did not make this fun for me.  Find someone else for your course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2008<br>Class Name: HIST171<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this teacher has seen better days. She doesnt teach! She doesn't even lecture! All she does is ask questions about the readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2008<br>Class Name: HIST114<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dislike her and so did students at Loyola.  Maybe the adm should look around before hiring people who get poor reviews.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2008<br>Class Name: HIS211<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nancy Turpin knows what she is talking about and I respect her as an academic.  However, I HATE the way that she grades.  At least 80% of the class received C's or below on our paper DRAFTS, which are worth 25% of our grades!  I have put a lot of work into this class, yet based on her values I don't have anything to show for it.  I'm disappointed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2007<br>Class Name: HST217<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly boring.  The class material isn't well structured at all, in my opinion.  Should you decide to enroll in a class that she teaches, I'd recommend bringing your laptop so you can work on assignments while she is &quot;lecturing&quot;.  If possible, however, I would advise others to find a better professor to take for history - it shouldn't be hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2006<br>Class Name: HIST217<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring.  This lady went on tangents every class.  Hard for me to stay focused.  Very knowledgable though, and helpful.  Wouldn't recommend her, but wouldn't keep away from her either.</div></div></div></body></html>
