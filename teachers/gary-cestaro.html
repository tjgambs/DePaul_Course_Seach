I've taken three classes with him and he's awesome. If you're an Italian student: CHECK YOUR GRAMMAR. He's super tough on that in papers, but otherwise he's so into what he's teaching it's adorable and (usually) pretty interesting. He cares what his students have to say and wants you to be interested.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2014<br>Class Name: ITA301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great teacher, very willing to help, and really seemed like he wanted to make sure everyone was learning, not just skating by. He really cares about his students and still says hello and remembers me when he sees me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2013<br>Class Name: LGQ150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved him. He was so kind to me and very interesting to talk with. He tends not to be very open to other opinions and can drone on. You can tell he loves his own voice. But, he was very understanding and helpful when I had to take an incomplete for personal reasons.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: LGQ150<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU ARE GAY. It is all history based and he does not treat it like an introductory course. Hard grader and lectures are extremely dull. I got a B so its not impossible.. but avoid it if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: LGB150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is NOT an easy A. There is a paper due every other week, a midterm, and cumulative final. He's a super hard grader and picks favorites in class. Unless your gay or want to minor in LGBQT studies, don't take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2012<br>Class Name: LGQ150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor. Really knows what he is talking about and vocalizes his knowledge in an incredibly educated manner. He always shares events revolving around the LGBTQ community at DePaul and really cares about the subject both in the classroom and out of the classroom. Highly recommend his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: ITA321<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's nice of you follow his strict rules, otherwise youre out of luck. Low workload, beyond easy tests and grader. Not a bad class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2012<br>Class Name: ITA103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a tough grader. When he teaches it is almost like he is a drill Sargent trying to engrave Italian in your mind. I felt very dumb in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2010<br>Class Name: ITA101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class wasn't difficult and the work load was relatively light. However, do not miss class! He does not take ANY late assignments unless you have approval from the Dean of Students. But in my case, he wouldn't accept my late work even with approval from the Dean of Students AND a Doctor's note. I will not take another class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>too much work and hard grader. Don't take him if yoou like getting a's and b's. He's a nice guy but gives everyone c's</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2006<br>Class Name: HNRS102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for Honors 102 and he was so nice.  He said he would only make us read interesting books.  Plus, all we had to do was write some short papers, the final was a creative writing assignment.  He kind of grades hard but he's helpful at the same time.  If you have him for a professor, don't worry.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: LGBTQSTUDIES<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gary seems like he's awesome at advocating for the queer minor, but his actual teaching skills were less than impressive. he was passionate, but simply did not know what he was doing. for being an intro class, it should have been called &quot;Queer Theory.&quot; Oh wait, we already have a class like that!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: ITA111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think he is a pretty good professor. I think that he should stray away more from the book, so we can understand the concepts better. He is always full of energy. PLEASE GO TO CLASS OR YOU WILL BE SCREWED!!!  I think if you can take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: ITA111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gary is the best. Very passionate but does demand that you keep up and do the homework. Sometimes funny, always available for questions or extra help. There is a reason he is the head of the Italian dept.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2005<br>Class Name: ITA111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a pretty good prof, I wish sometimes he would speak some English so I can gain the concepts better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: ITA202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked Gary a lot. He really makes sure that you understand the material and is always willing to help. Quizzes can be tricky if you don't keep up with the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2005<br>Class Name: ITALIAN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good teacher, a bit too strict about attendance for my liking.  counts 2 late arrivals as an absence, so commuters beware!  especially for those coming from the south suburbs.  overall a good, fun class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: ITA111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class for one week because I got in trouble for speaking spanish, but it was hard for me to grasp concepts, especially when he always spoke Italian.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2004<br>Class Name: ITA114<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gary is a great teacher.  He really cares about his students and the language.  I dont recommend slacking in this class.  He does not tolerate late work unless you have a good excuse.  He is real strict about attendance too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: ITA<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gary is a great teacher.  If you spend time studying everyday you should do fine in the class.  I definately recommend taking Italian from him instead of Daniela or Marta.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2004<br>Class Name: ITA113<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2004<br>Class Name: ITA<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY helpful, and very clear.  The workload can be a lot sometimes, but its never too hard and it is what makes you learn.  He really gives you a handle on the language and it really sticks with you.  He's the best ITA prof I've had so far.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2004<br>Class Name: ITA111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not terribly helpful, but resources are there in the language lab.  Class is mostly discussion, and Cestaro is very charismatic in leading discussion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2004<br>Class Name: ITA202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gary is more difficult than Daniella, as his teaching style is not as European.  He demands much, but is always willing to help and give a few more points.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2003<br>Class Name: ITA<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An excellent teacher who really knows his stuff. If you want to learn Italian that will stay with you, definately take Cestaro!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2003<br>Class Name: ITA1023<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good professor.
