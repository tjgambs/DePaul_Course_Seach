If you like independent study (for the field trips), you can only be limited by how much effort you put in.  Easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2006<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!!! Make sure you utilize his office hours and ask plenty of questions and you will get an A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's actually a pretty decent professor. All you have to do is pay attention to additional details about the slides of his lectures because they will be on the midterm or final exams. Put more effort on the labs because thats where majority of your grade comes from. Fairly easy if you study the slides and understand the experiments (only 3).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2006<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: ENV216<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Warning...if you have any choice, avoid him. Eames is very egotistical and loves to waste class time talking about himself. The assignments are VERY involved and require help outside of class. To succeed in this class demands an open schedule for unnecessary field trips and tough assignments (reworking calculations he's paid to do as a consultant).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2006<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class is way hard for an intro class, don't take him if you want an easy class. a good guy though, he can be pretty funny. just follow directions on the lab reports and pay attention in lecture and you'll do fine.  there's also a huge curve built into the class and i was able to get an A even with a C on the midterm and Bs on the lab reports.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENVSCIENCE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I've ever had. His lectures are interesting, but class is hard.  Labs and exams are difficult (especially the exams, they're ridiculous, nearly everyone fails ).You have TA's who don't know what they're doing, and whose grading criteria differ from the professor(got mad at girl when she disagree with him) Would never take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Eames is a great professor. His class may take alot of work but it is very easy to get an A. His tests are hard but there are so many points available with other assignments is does not matter if you do poorly. Great teeacher and very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does not believe in hand outs and expects you to take a lot of notes for his hard quizes and tests. He asks ridiculous questions and hopes you get them wrong.  He grades hard on top of his hard quizes and tests..  Hes boring and he thinks hes god.  enough said, I'm sure everyone else will agree.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2005<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Constantly tries to undermine students. Really boring, he runs on tangents which ALWAYS END UP TALKING ABOUT FOOD & NOT THE ENVIRONMENT!!! &quot;Fun Fridays&quot; really suck when you watch videos on other really boring teachers lecturing. Awful grader, inapproachable, thinks he's a god. Ridiculous teacher...I'm really worried to get my grade!! STAY AWAY!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He expects technical/stylistic perfection but doesn't give guidance. Misguided in his idea of perfection. I think he wants us to be intimidated by his class, instead of enjoying what it has to offer. Long personal (boring)tangents instead of teaching, but doesn't offer handouts, powerpoint, text book guidance. His class is unorganized (worst way)!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2005<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unequivocally one of the worst classes I have ever taken at DePaul, not b/c of the subject matter but b/c of the prof. I came into this class really hoping to like it, but came out of it having learned very little and unfortunately having dealt with an unreasonable man who played favorites like it was his job. Ridiculous.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2005<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you hate science, you gonna hate it even more after this course. He is a picky and hard grader. He thinks he's funny but in actuality he isn't. Piece of Advice: He's a bad professor, quite boring, and this class is very time consuming. I want my money back!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy to get an A in this class.  Just do the higher point assignments and you should have no problem passing it with a minimum of a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He goes off on tangents constantantly during class and uses no visuals or notes for his lectures,so his class is not very stimulating.  He is not easy to approach even at his office hours.  He expects 110% out of his students but he does not contribute an equal effort at all!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: ENV116<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Run away now. Incapable of teaching. We had to pick a 12 page term paper subject the 1st day of class. What the spanish call el terrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a likeable guy, and pretty flexible. Make sure to do high point value assignments EARLY, because you determine your own grade. If you're a good writer but don't like science, you can still do well. His quizzes are tough though, so study hard and pay attention in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I ever had. He thinks that everyone in the class has all the free time in the world to go on field trips. Picks favorites. If you do not like science, do not take him. He does not know how to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard grader.

The subject matter isn't hard.  The class is as fun as you make it.  I had a great time, though he is a hard grader.  I eneded up with a B- which was unexpected.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2004<br>Class Name: ENV<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is boring and scattered. He totally picks favorites. If you done like to kiss ass 24/7 then you wont like him. As far as helping out goes, every response is see the book or syllabis</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2004<br>Class Name: ENV<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring, picks favorites and only pays attention to them, unfair grader, horrible little field trips.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2004<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated him.  He's boring, I had trouble staying awake in the class. Can't teach if his life depended on it.

Doesnt explain anything, never lectures, never demonstrates anything as opposed to other teachers who are always doing power point presentations for their class.
