He plays a lot of youtube clips to break up the material to keep everyone interested. He is funny and someone you don't have a problem going up to for a question. There is a quiz everyweek but almost all the answers are in the powerpoints or book. Then 2 case study papers that aren't hard. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2015<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have a chance to take him, do it.  He's a young professor who is clearly passionate in what he does and he is NOT boring!  All the quizzes you take are online, he provides you with the power points from lecture, 2 papers for the entire quarter, and he gives extra credit.  What more can you ask for?!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2015<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Blight's lectures aren't mind numbingly dull nor is he a boring person. Not bad on the eyes either. He's really funny in a dorky, corny way. Only two papers for the quarter and all of his weekly quizzes are online and he gives you notes in class so the book is just an additional resource for the occasional difficult question. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2015<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Blight is an incredible professor. He really knows the material he is teaching and makes it relatable for the students. He makes class genuinely fun even when we're learning about material that some may find uninteresting. There are weekly quizzes but they really aren't bad and you do them online. We had two essays and thats about it. A+</div></div></div></body></html>
