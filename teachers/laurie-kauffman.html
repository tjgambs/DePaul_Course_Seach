Most times lab gets out early. Teacher dose a GREAT job teaching the material and understood that we were not biology majors. She was very knowledgeable and always encourages her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2010<br>Class Name: BIO206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes.

She really got me interested and I could tell she was very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. Quizzes and assignments were pretty easy, but she still challenges students. She's funny, too! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: BIO212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anatomy...good class.  Learned a lot.  Kauffman is a good teacher and cares about the students and making class more interesting.  That being said, class was basically taking notes, which could be really boring.  Good class, good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really recommend this professor! She is soo nice and helpful.  She was always available to answer your questions. I am horrible with anything that has to do with science..I failed my midterm and pretty much did horrible on my quizzes but I ended up with a B in the class.. take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very effective teacher. I loved her class and I would recommend it to everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2010<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2010<br>Class Name: BIO224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like her. She writes the notes on the board so you have to be in attendance to get them. She is very knowledgeable on the human body. She answeres our quirky questions. The tests and quizzes are fair, and the homework is very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2009<br>Class Name: BIO205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for Neurobiology. She is very through, and does not assume people come into the class with extensive knowledge. Some of the topics covered she did not seem too familiar with, but was always willing to look up answers and get back to the class. Pretty easy class and interesting material. I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2009<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you need a Lab - definitely take this class! This prof makes biology very accessible and fun. She's also very fair.  There are 3 quizzes, 2 articles, 2 tests, and weekly labs. Buy the text online as it is very expensive. It is not difficult to do well - just make sure you come to lab and make use of the study guides for MT & Final. I got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2009<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is amazing! so helpful! I'm not a bio major so I knew this would be a difficult class but it really isn't...if you go to class, its not mandatory but still go becasue you learn so much..if you go to class and study you will do fine in the class...her labs are also fun..there not boring like HS labs!! take his prof if you get a chance!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
