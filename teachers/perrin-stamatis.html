He has a lot of experience to give him some credibility, but very down to earth and interested in his students. Cut me a lot of slack (when it definitely wasn't warranted!) and was a real human teacher instead of a robot. I'm really excited to be in another one of his classes this next quarter!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: GD105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is great! Really helpful and kind. He wants his students to learn the material and get an A. Don't buy the books. Weekly projects which can be resubmitted for a better grade and one final project. Attend class so you can learn the programs and not fall behind. Overall, he is excellent & funny and the class is very valuable. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: GD105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome guy. SO chill and laid back. the class was really interesting and fun. All projects no test. don't buy the book, we didnt even touch it. I seriously would take every class with him if i could, very approachable and really funny! Usually can finish projects in class, so no homework. Take!!</div></div></div></body></html>
