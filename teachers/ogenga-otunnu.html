    Otunnu is an AMAZING prof. He is very intelligent, has an interesting background, and is willing to work w/ students if you put in work, too. You must work very hard in this class to get a good grade. Students who expect to get an A just by showing up will do poorly in this class. Take Otunnu he will challenge you but you will get so much out of it

    I am a History major and I found this class to be oen of the worst examples of the History department at this school. I was very unimpressed with the readings he chose and how he used them. I worked my ass off in that that class and I would ahve dropped it if I could.

    Otunnu is a brilliant man and hes teaching style is unique. Don't expect his class to be like others that you have taken, because the structure will be fundamentally different. If you can reconcile with that difference initially, then you will substantially evolve your critical and analytical skills and perceptions in her course.

    He is one of the worst professors I have experienced at DePaul.  He does not seem to be a honest and good person either.  A lot of people in our class had problems with him.  I think DePaul needs to evaluate him because he is making the school look bad.

    I took Prof. Otunnu's class in the summer. I will take his classes again and again. He is at the top of his profession. DePaul needs more professors like him. Prepare to work hard in his class and follow his lectures and readings.

    I am glad that I took four classes with Prof. Otunnu. He is an excellent prof: clarity, critical engagement, assistance to students, academic rigor, etc. As I join Northwestern to complete my graduate work, I will take his course on Forced Migration at NW. Students who do not get good grades because the instructors just hand them such grades--will

    Worst teacher I've ever had. He does not care about his students. He canceled about 3 of our night classes and 1 of those we did not find out about until we arrived in the classroom. He doesn't respond to emails. You have to teach yourself through the extensive amount of reading he assigns. He doesn't know how to teach and he doesn't make sense.

    This guy is HORRIBLE! waaaaay too much reading that we didn't even go over in class. and instead of posting reading material on blackboard, he just tells you to google smth and if you cant find it, tough luck. His exams are VERY HARD and he IS NOT an easy grader! He doesn't really care about his students and whether they do well in his class    :(

    Hes a great guy and a good prof.Jokes around alot but the class is a whole diff story. You have an in class response paper to something u read, and then a mid term which is basically u writing for 2 hrs straight. And 2 weeks after the mid a 10 pg paper is due, after that its easy in fact we didnt go to the last 2 classes. Too much reading tho.

    While his lectures are fascinating &amp; he's generally an amiable person - it seems as though teaching is an afterthought of a job for him. He's inconsistent with his grading &amp; allots/takes points arbitrarily and not based on actual merit. Participation was worth 15% though he canceled 2 classes, scheduled exams for 3, &amp; let us out early everyday.

    My advisor check prof. Otunnu's taeaching evaluation in the department of history (they are in files at the reception) and confirmed that his evaluations are at the top. He is extremely popular with students and does an outstanding job. Just ask for the evaluations. Those who are complaining are a very tiny % of his students.

    Someone who was in the same class with me claim on this forum that her/his advisor suggested that students don't take the professor's classes because they have had many problems. Here are simple questions: why are his courses full every year&#63; Why do my graduate colleagues in ISP &quot;die&quot; to have him as their theses supervisor&#63; The prof is great!!

    If you are willing to work hard, take his courses. His teaching expectations are shaped by his previous training and teaching in Canada and the UK. If you have been getting good grades for poor quality work, don't take him. Baptism by fire!!

    I agree that students who don't follow instruction and don't work hard should avoid prof. Otunnu. However, those who qualify to join any majot university should take him. His expectations are quite high and he lectures with that in mind. Excellent professor who is willing to help student reach their full potential.

    I took the same course with some of the people who wrote quite harshly about the professor. Those of us who participated in class, followed the instruction he gave, and worked hard, got very good grades. The professor was quite clear in what he expected us to accomplish. he was very clear in his lectures. The grading was clear as well. The problem

    Although students who don't work hard and who not that smart complain about this professor, he is one of the best professors I have met. Extremely smart. Knows the subjects he teaches so well. Has published extensively in the field. And is invited to lecture at the leading universities in Europe and North America.

    Bad news bears. His assignments were beyond unclear, ambiguous, and very little guidance was given as to what we even needed to do to get a good grade in the class. Suppose it didn't really matter -- his grading on things like participation (which was worth 15% of the final grade) were done arbitrarily. Nice guy, but I'd never take him again.

    I am a senior with a 4.0 who enjoys history.  WORST PROF. EVER.  SOOOO unclear in what he wants in EVERY assignment.  Only lectured in 3 of 10 night classes, other classes were exams that were never clearly explained. I can handle a heavy workload, but it doesnt matter if you do the reading if he never explains the exams &amp; grades hard.  goodbye 4.0

    Another example of a smart person who should not be teaching.  He is unavailable, and inconsistent and also lectures for less than 2 hours of a 3 hour night class.  He cancelled one class because it was inauguration night.  Not worth the money, aggravation or time if you ask me.

    DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN..it's clear he couldn't care less about how his students do, he is very unclear and short about what he expects out of you, on top of that the subject he gave my final paper on wasn't even covered in class and barely in the assigned reading, and i have to write a ten pg paper and do a 20 min presentation on it...AVIOD!!!!

    I don't know what these people are talking about.  This man was possibly the worst professor I've ever had... he's a nice man, he's just never in the country enough to teach a class, and doesn't care.  He lectured in 5 classes out of 10, and even then he was repetitive and not cohesive-- although mildly amusing.  Take him if you have time to waste.

    he was extremly informed in the topic, alot of the readings were his published works. He was a fairly tough grader but if you do the readings you really should not have a problem. He has an accent but you can get over it. He was one of the best teachers I have had this year, I actually learned alot in the class.

    I am not good at history classes, but I couldn't resist a class called World Refugee Crisis.  The topic intrigued me, and so did the course.  There was a lot of reading and he was not an easy grader, but I would take him again b/c he's very informed, hilarious, and genuinely a good person.  You'll like him.  It's worth the work.

Very interesting lectures, wants his students to learn and do well, has hands on experience on the topics he discusses.  If you get a chance to take his class, DO IT, even if its not ur major or concentration, you wont regret it!

    I absolutely love Dr. Otunnu. I know a lot of students don't like his class, but I think they're afraid of a heavy workload. He's very knowledgeable about the subject matter and will help you if you ask for it. I've taken two courses from him and hope I can take more. I can't get enough.

    Otunnu is one of the *best* professors at DePaul. I felt honored to be one of his students. You have to work really hard but it's well worth it. Don't take the class if you aren't willing to do a lot of reading.

    Hard grader. Holds monopoly on African History. If you are History major, I suggest to avoid him and take Ancient Egypt instead, for African domain. HE WILL MESS UP your****GPA!

    Otunnu is a good teacher. Explanations are  clear and he encourages class debates. he keeps class interesting. his teacher style is rigorous, but you dont leave empty headed if you follow the reading. try to read the assigned readings before class and you'll most likely make an A.

    This class was tons of reading. He graded his essays very tough. In fairness he is open to let students do makeups. Basically our entire class ended up doing. I took this during summer - all I have to say is that between classes we were giving reading assignments that came to a total of 300 pages. With all that being said I was content with B.

    He was very interesting BUT all essays are written in class with a specific outline and without notes.  Some of reading I had to re-read to really get it, but if you keep up with the mountains of readings, you'll do good...but you've got to read the material. He is very helpful and a good lecturer.

    3 small papers, 1 final paper and 1 presentation are expected.  Otunnu never lectured and the student presentations were nothing more than book reports of the material you were expected to read.  Five weeks were spent learning nothing.  Very frustrating waste of money and time.

    It is important that you take time to read his material. Very understanding professor- and clases are not boring. If he sees that the students are bored he knws he failed his job and will let the students out early. Very comical. his 228 is about african images, colonization, apatheid.

    instead of learning about world wars and there dates and hilter this and stalin that- you learn about events that are really interesting like genocide. if you can withstand a lecture and take notes- and READ like 50 pages a week- you'll totally do fine in this class. Got a B+ and I forgot to read for a whole week and half.

    He really knows his material, and he's so passionate about it that you can't help but be interested in what he's saying.  Although his grading was tough, and the work load at times a bit much, I learned a lot in this class and it was always engaging and interesting.I recommend him completely.

    Otunnu makes himself extremely unavailable to students. When he says he will be in his office, he usually isn't, so it's impossible to ask him for help or grades. He doesn't really seem to care if anyone learns, just if he gets through it all. His teaching style and his syllabus are VERY hard to understand!!

    One of the nicest, happiest professors at Depaul. However, he gave me the first C I've ever received on a test. Our class meets once a week &amp; so for the past 4 weeks we've had an essay test each time we've met! Not to mention the 15 page paper thats due! It is nearly impossible to take this class while taking three others. Also, A TON of reading!

    Very interesting!!Otunnu expects you to know too much, very unfair if you havent taken African history before.To get a good grade you have to treat his class like a Sr. Level class.All essay tests,does not specify what he wants on the tests just says do your best and grades you according to everyone

I asked if I could look at the grades for the whole quarter cause I thought I did better, he said &quot;how bout a B+&#63;&quot;  I still think I got an A.  Avoid this teacher...he pretty much gives everyone a B, but I don't think A possible
