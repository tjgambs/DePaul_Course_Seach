But, I learned SO MUCH from taking it. Jim can be pretty picky, but he is hilarious and very helpful. I would definitely take him again. Make sure you have time for this class because working on crisis scenarios with your group can be time consuming. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD396<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Motzer was great- 100% if you have the chance to take him, it is a must.  Out of my 3 years at Depaul, he was my favorite teacher.  I have never rated a professor before, but with him I felt the need to promote such a wonderful professor.  He's the best.  Earn his respect and he will help you every step of the way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD337<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jim was a great teacher, no doubt. However, the class had three group projects with same group members... so pretty much expect to be screwed over and doing all the work for three other people.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2013<br>Class Name: PRAD391<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this class. Learned a lot of really useful info on PR and media relations. Motzer is a professional and has a lot of experience and insight to share. He definitely challenges you, but its worth it. Visited agencies and got to network with professionals. Highly recommended course and professor for PR majors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jim Motzer is by far one of my favorite teachers here at DePaul. I have taken two classes with him, Crisis Communication and PR Campaigns. He's is always available to help via email. He's a hard grader but with his class, you don't mind going the extra mile. The lessons he teaches are extremely valuable to my future career!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE MOTZER! He is one of the best teachers I have ever had and truly cares about helping every student succeed. He does not only help with the class but will set you up with future opportunities and wisdom. His class is worth taking and he is worth getting to know. You will have to put a lot of work in to get an A but it is absolutely worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2012<br>Class Name: PRAD377<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very entertaining teacher but his grading was also very challenging. We had to do a campaign and it seemed like we always had to change our project ideas according to his liking/preference. A lot of the assignments seemed to not be thoroughly discussed in class. It also seems to mock his students of assignments were done incorrectly/poorly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2012<br>Class Name: HON376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easily my favorite teacher at DePaul. Clearly outlines class expectations and works to help his students succeed. Offers career mentoring which is a great tool for anyone looking to go in to PR as he has years of agency experience and knows the right people. Incredibly supportive of his students and passionate about the material he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't say enough good things about Professor Motzer. His classes are engaging and interesting and very helpful to the real world. He also does his best to help his students gain real world connections and he really cares about the students. One of the best professors I've had here at DePaul and makes Public Relations really interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class! Prof Motzer can be tough on his students but it's to help you out. Be sure to participate as much as possible in his class. He wants to engage students in the lectures and participation is worth a lot. I thought i was going to get a C but ended with an A! Take advantage of his extra credit, it helps a lot.Brought my B to an </div></div></div></body></html>
