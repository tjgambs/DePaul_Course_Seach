Disappointed to see "easy" translate to good. You have to work for it, but if you want to come away from a course with an understanding of how these texts can affect the way you think and live as a HUMAN BEING, take the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: ENG363<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>He definitely knows his stuff, but all he does is tell you what to write down, there is no discussion and his midterm and final are not easy. If you want to do well you have do the readings and go to class. He calls you if you don't go, so don't take him unless you want to be lectured at and watch pointless films in class every other day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2013<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I believe that he was once a good professor, but I feel as if he is losing interest or something. If you do not like blindly following someone else's opinions don't take this class, because you are graded on how well you can reiterate him. We watched a lot of videos. Make sure you pay attention to "buzz words."</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2013<br>Class Name: ENG386<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>super intense. knows a LOT about the short stories/novels we cover. he literally does all the analysis for you except for the final paper and final exam (which are the only 2 grades for the whole course, just warning you). i think people have mixed feelings about him but i really liked this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2012<br>Class Name: ENG110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Came highly recommended, but I have to say I was disappointed.  Insightful, but NOT good at getting the students to interpret literature, because he does it for them!  His class structure and grading are fair, but I fail to see the allure from people who took more classes from him--unless they like being spoon-fed!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2011<br>Class Name: ENG395<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He cares that his students whether or not his students are absorbing the material but he is a &quot;my way or the highway&quot; professor, and for an English class that doesn't allow you much room for interpreting readings because if you don't agree with him you fail. I think he probably used to be a good professor but he is starting to go senile.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2011<br>Class Name: ENG360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took most of Dr. Ingrasci's American lit classes as an undergrad at DePaul. They were all amazing! He is a very entertaining and knowledgeable lecturer. He does not use a text book - just the original work plus a thick book of lit crit articles and the like.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked this class and the professor.  We had a midterm, final, and paper. Just show up to class (don't miss or else he'll call you ha), listen to the lectures, and be open to learning a new way of thinking that is different than the norm.  The $30 packet he gives you is like the guide to the class. I recommend getting the books from the library.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was awesome.  With Ingrasci, you either love him or you hate him.  If you're open to changing your views on life then take him.  If you're set in your ways- don't.  Really easy class, he just lectures the whole time and we watch movies! He's a really brilliant professor who actually cares. Paper and final. That's it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2011<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Are you all serious&#63; He had interesting material.. but he didn't act professional towards any students. He swore WAY too much, even for a university professor. And 30 dollars for some paper&#63; One, no way in hell. Two, taking money from students is illegal. He's smart obviously, but also a tool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2011<br>Class Name: ENG465<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best instructor & friend I ever had -- from my B.A. through to my M.A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ingrasci is crazy. In both good and bad ways. I found it a little hard to understand his train of thought, but he was so eccentric that I enjoyed his classes. He also swears up a storm every class. You'll do well on his tests if you use the buzz-words that he puts on the study guides. He's not my favorite professor in the department, but he's fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2010<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes you pay $30 for readings he prints and puts into a book for you.He gives them to you the first day of class then tells you he needs the money because he's paying for his (adult) children's schooling and apartments. Says there aren't enough courses at DePaul based on values and so this class emphasizes values. Have to rent/watch nine movies</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2010<br>Class Name: ENG362<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very intelligent.  A bit eccentric.  Has an unshakable grip on the classroom agenda (a bit controlling), so don't expect it to be lackadaisical.  Funny.  If you work hard and show interest and respectfulness, you can stay on his good side.  He's just as concerned with teaching about morality and the human experience as he is about teaching English.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2009<br>Class Name: ENG330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Ingrasci three tomes as an undergrad. Now, that I am in Grad school and almost finished I can without a doubt conclude Ingasci is the Prof. that I inspire to be. Arguable at times and certainly bias, he is a true animal when it comes to lit. If you don't take him you are missing out on a true human experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Self absorbed, endlessly relates works to his own life.

While Dr. Ingrasci's ability to make us think may seem comensurate to his ability to scare his more timid students, make no mistake, he is without a doubt thee most inspirational professor I've ever witnessed.  While some may find his oratory dogmatic, the man is living evidence that genius is often tumultuous.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2008<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have graduated from DePaul 2 years ago in English and I can say that the reason I teach the way I do today is because of this man.

He is so vague about what he wants, yet is so demanding about being specific. He will not help you at all so don't even think about asking because you'll probably just piss him off. You'll get a decent grade after being completely depressed by listening to one of his &quot;I hate the world&quot; lectures. Buzz Kill. Don't recommend!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2008<br>Class Name: ENG361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The only down point I would say is that he is a little jarring at times and if you disagree with a reading that he has of a book you are wrong; He is very Static (once you take his class you'll get that joke). With that in mind I still say that he is the best English Prof I've had at Depaul, just not very forgiving on opinion you'll never be bored.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: ENG300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Somebody give this man an award.

Yes he can be intimidating at first. But sometimes you just look at him and think he's the sweetest old man. I love his class, he really keeps you on your toes.

Cool English majors never want to take another prof again after they've had him.  He gets so worked up that he starts foaming a little at the mouth-- and that's awesome.

May not always encourage discussions but presents info in a way that is helpful. Exams make you think and the papers are no less demanding.

He makes class interesting and fun, but also learn A LOT. We had to read 3 books (good books so it wasn't hard) and take quizes on them.

Very strict and will pump you full of more information than you could even think about aquiring, but seriously a genius.  TAKE HIS CLASSES!!!  I took three and would love to be able to go back for more.  Be on time.  Be prepared.  Be ready to read like a mother.  He can teach you so much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the most interesting professors I've ever had. I really got alot out of his course, more than I ever expected.  Probably one of the best professors at DePaul period!  He is NO pushover, If you take him, expect to work hard. He can come off as a bit of jerk sometimes, and expect to read a ton.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: MAJORAUTHORS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He comes off like a jerk, but he is great!  He knew I was struggling with some of the stuff, and he was very understanding.  He just wants you to TRY!  He's unbelievably interesting if you can just get past what he wants you to see as his arrogance.  He's brilliant, and he really cares about his students, even if he acts like a jerk sometimes. :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: ROMANTICISM<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very challenging, but the best class I've taken yet.

Ingrasci's a great lecturer, but prob not too good for younger peeps, or those with tude. He will force you to read more than ever in 10 weeks, but you walk out with a brain overflowing. This class really is a rehash of his Romanticism class, which is great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2005<br>Class Name: ALLOFTHEM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The prophet is good, but I call him the rock star.

He'll make you think about the world in a different way and you'll never read another book the same way--he'll give you the tools to truly decipher literature.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to be preached to rather than taught, this class is fine for you. There was no open discussion of class material. Orders were just barked at us. Otherwise, an easy class to do well in if you gave him exactly what he wanted. Unfortunate, given how interesting the class material was.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2005<br>Class Name: MAJORAUTHORS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great!

That's all I can say. Swears more than a sailor and is not really approachable about things.  The class is pretty easy just watch a ton of movies, and MOST (NOT ALL) aren't that bad.

He picks good novels, some more shocking than others, that make u think</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: ENG386<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers at DePaul. Can be easy if you do exactly what he says, but can be fun if you challenge him and call him on his b.s.  Willing to help you with your grade if you show initiative and talk to him outside class.

He is fast-paced and exciting.  He states a lot of things as fact-of-the-matter.

This guy is the man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2005<br>Class Name: ROMANTICISM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is different. i don't know about the best ever but i loved him and he gives amazing notes. he wants you to repeat what he teaches you in essays and on tests and can be a little rude  and condescending if you are on his bad side. easy grader though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: SOUTHERNLITGR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intense. I actually wanted to do more than the minimum even thought it was only an elective for me. His classes teach students how to appreciate what we have and the privilage of going to college.

I do not understand why so many people think he's so great- he's at least passionate, but other than that he has nothing on some of the great teachers at depaul. It's scary to think he is the &quot;best&quot; in the english department</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Possibly the archetype of what a great professor should be. A consummate professional that will drive you to work your hardest. You can do well in this course with minimal effort, but you are only ripping yourself off. Teaching style is beyond innovative.
