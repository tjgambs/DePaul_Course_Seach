He is informative and really wants his students to succeed. He doesn't spoonfeed, he just makes sure he is clear and gives plenty of opportunities to ask questions. He is intelligent, funny, wise, and offers great feedback and insights.

Take advantage of any  easy extra credit work- you'll need it. Get second opinions on your papers because he takes off points to the hundredth point. 2 long midterm+final papers, weekly quizzes, no textbooks needed, & discussion posts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Monotonous but his voice is like an ASMR trigger. Prepare to do readings, do the extra credit. Will give back quizzes within one week, gives written feedback on essays. He will bring you to the sketchiest of places; you will have quite the story to tell once you finish his Explore Chicago class. Overall a very laidback guy, super cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2014<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Daniel has been one of my favorite professors at DePaul so far. Interesting readings, very knowledgeable, will go to great lengths to help you if you put forth the effort, and overall a really cool dude.

DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. DEPAUL IS EVEN DISAPPOINTED IN HIM.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2013<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Makagon was clear, informative, and caring in a professional way. I had some difficulties adjusting to University as a Freshman and he made considerate, understanding accommodations that allowed me to finish the quarter off on a strong note.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2012<br>Class Name: MCS373<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Daniel is a great guy. Super nice and very passionate about his work. He offers a lot of feedback and insight into your work. I truly felt like he cared and wanted to engage with his students work. That being said, work hard because it will be more rewarding if you have work you're proud of and want to discuss. Not an easy A, but not too difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: MCS353<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Daniel is a really cool dude.  This class was really interesting--we had a different guest speaker every Tuesday night to give us a different perspective of the music industry. Weekly quizzes were hard though. Not an easy A but definitely worth taking this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2011<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor at DePaul! His class is always fun, exciting, and intellectual. The readings he assigns may be dull and a bit too long sometimes, but you'll learn a lot! This is probably the class I've learned the most at DePaul. I came out feeling good after every class. He's awesome! Not a hard grader, extremely funny, down-to-earth and cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: CMN335<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Daniel is a great professor.  His class is always enjoyable and informative.  He doesn't assign a lot of daily work, but you need to stay on top of the reading to get a good grade.  You are not going to get an A in this class if you apply yourself like a C student.  I would highly recommend though.  He has much to offer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2010<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Daniel's a really really great guy. He's extremely easy to relate to and genuinely kind. His explore class is... a little pathetic in terms of subject matter, just because I think he takes it a little too seriously, but you learn a lot and experience so much in the class. Also listening to music is fun :) The quizzes are super easy, just read.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: COM103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>loved this class! he is an amazing professor and really easy to relate to. if i could, i'd take this class over and over again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2009<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy but a hard grader. class was fun however.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2009<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makagon is an amazing professor- one of my favorites.

He is probably one of the best teachers I will ever have. Very interesting topics and class excursions. I would take any class of his.

He is hilarioius, he has a way of talking that will just make you laugh. He is very helpful, creative and intelligent.

I definately agree that he is a tough grader. Sometimes I felt that I did awesome, but did not get the grade I expected; however, he is really helpful.  I never hesitated to ask questions or e-mail him.  The class was not exactly what I thought it was, but we did do some cool stuff and had interesting readings. I got an A-</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall a good prof.

The description for this class addressed more aspects of underground culture besides punk rock but it turns out we didn't study anything but that.  DMak seems to be obsessed with zines which pretty much bore me.  Long readings, pop quizzes, random sh*t that doesn't relate to class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2005<br>Class Name: EXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Out of all my grades, I am an A student, I got the worst by him. He is so unorganized and unclear. He makes you read before every class and gives pop quizzes, which is pathetic if you ask me. There were 3 times when class went an hour and a half past time! It is fine if you want to be strict on dumb things like attendance and quizzes just don't foo</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2005<br>Class Name: EXPLOREISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Daniel's class was ridiculously hard for an Explore class -- honestly it was harder than my Chemistry class. Quizzes are very difficult and there is little preparation for them. Heavy amount of reading and small amounts of actualy exposure to culture which is the point of the class. I am an A student, and I struggled the most in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2005<br>Class Name: EXPLORE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for Underground Cultures: he talks slow, gives difficult 2 question tests on long reading assignments, and isn't very flexible.  Its his first year at Depaul and it shows in his teachings.  I would never take him again.  It seems like he plays favorites and all we do is talk about punk rock--- we are missing so much about culture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: EXPLOREUGC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He means well but is really obnoxiously obssesed with punk rock. I thought we were going to learn about many aspects of underground culture but we are stictly learning the things he does and likes. If you are not as jazzed about things as he is he takes it personal.Assignments are unclear and he likes to give pop quizzes,feels like high school.</div></div></div></body></html>
