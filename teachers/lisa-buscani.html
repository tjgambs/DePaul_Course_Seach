She has some really cool experiences to share, and I loved listening to her. She made class really interesting with different clips and stories. Very frank, funny woman. I didn't know much about ethics before this also so its a great intro class! Would totally take again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: DC228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Class is lectures where she just reads off the slides. Class thrives off of student interaction. 3 papers with peer reviews. No midterm. Two online exams that are harder than expected everything is just pulled from slides. Final exam is presentation and there are easy extra credit opportunities. Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2015<br>Class Name: GAM228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>I hated every second of this class. The papers were long, the readings were boring, and she was never completely satisfied with response posts or papers. The papers were extremely long and there is even a GROUP project for an ONLINE class. Her lectures were incredibly boring and it my ears bleed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2014<br>Class Name: GAM228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Buscani is AWESOME!

I took it as a non-DC major and it was easy. She plays a lot of clips and she is really funny. She has the best one liners. She is an easier grader and midterm is take home.  Only 3 papers and they are your opinions based straight off the power points. Plus she offers extra credit. Highly recommend taking one of her classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2012<br>Class Name: GAM228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's pretty cool.

She shows good films, gives a lot of notes, and she is very nice and a fair grader. However, her tests were pretty difficult, and the amount of information on each director was a lot. It required a lot of studying time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love me some Lisa Buscani.  This woman single-handedly will change your opinion about coming to class.  She plays teacher and friend extremely well.
