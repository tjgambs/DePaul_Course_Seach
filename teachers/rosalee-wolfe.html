Tried to make the class interesting, but...dear God, the thought of coming to class made me cry every day. Did nothing but watch the clock, brought my laptop to keep me entertained. Terrible class. Maybe it was the subject matter. Dragged like nothing else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2010<br>Class Name: IT231<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows what shes talking about, showed a passion for it and instilled it upon us.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2010<br>Class Name: IT231<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She explained everything out well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2010<br>Class Name: GPH448<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is enthusiastic, organized and really knows the subject matter.

We got to take the midterm twice and it was almost the exact same test. The final was the midterm, but with some extra questions. Everything from the HW was covered in class, no internet searches required. Probably the easiest class I've taken at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: GPH448<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The instructor was very helpful inside and outside of class. She was very encouraging and open about the course work.

I really feel like she spent a lot of time reviewing the past weeks work in order for people to fully understand Ruby and how it can work to benefit us in our real life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2010<br>Class Name: IT231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof is amazing!!!1-she is really respected in the industry. 2-she is well organized and certainly TEACHES the material. 3-In any IT course there are always the ppl that simply aren't cut out for it(we all know them). These are the people that leave bad remarks. If you get less than a &quot;B&quot; you either shouldn't be in the course or you're lazy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2009<br>Class Name: GPH448<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enthusiastic. During my undergrad studies (at another college), a lot of the instructors at the CS department were very burned out and simply there because they had tenure, or they were new and were trying to teach the material in a very methodical and lackluster fashion. Dr. Wolfe was the complete opposite.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2009<br>Class Name: GPH448<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her handouts really helped us understand what we were learning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2009<br>Class Name: GPH448<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never been more compelled or enthusiastic to do coursework for a professor. She is obviously we respected in the industry and well versed in the material. More than anything else, however, I appreciate her encouraging nature and positive outlook.

She is fun, has a great personality, very engaging, very enthusiastic toward students and the course material.

She helps students out a lot if they need it and she really knows her subject forward and backward.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2009<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Made no sense what  so ever. If students had not prior knowledge of subject matter and most  of the other students she would not review.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2006<br>Class Name: GPH448<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2006<br>Class Name: 448<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wolfe had to deprecate the class assignments because this particular course is geared towards artists and programmers.  Artists can barely script, so it was kinda boring for the coders.  However, I did get a job in the industry 4 months after graduation, so I think she's a pretty good mentor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: GPH539<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I totally agree with the person above.  She's a horrible teacher.  She's has a cocky attitude that goes nowhere in the field.  I really love making spheres, boxes, and teapots for 10 weeks straight.  Wow, what an amazing graduate course.  I learned sooo much from this experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2004<br>Class Name: GPH448<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Where to start&#63; This professor has very poor teahcing skills. Her mind is so preoccupied with things outside of the school setting that its like she is teaching at us rather than to us. AND I QUOTE~class#1~ &quot;You guys are grad students, you should learn most of the material on your own.&quot;</div></div></div></body></html>
