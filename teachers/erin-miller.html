Such a nice lady and really knows her stuff, made class fun and interesting. There's a good mix of reading, with 2 papers and weekly quizzes, but they're easy if you did the reading and she gives you study guides. I learned a lot and got an A, would definitely take her again. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2012<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class! Erin was great - broke down topics, was extremely clear, and very understanding! There is a reading quiz every week (I took a night class) and the questions were simple - straight from the reading (which were not that bad). All around great class.</div></div></div></body></html>
