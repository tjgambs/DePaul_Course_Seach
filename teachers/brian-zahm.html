Even though we have a three hour class period, most of the knowledge required for the big test in the middle of the term comes straight out of the textbook, which he expects you to read in full and barely goes over in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2015<br>Class Name: DC110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Love his lectures, I learned A LOT! But sometimes he does mumble or speak quietly  which makes it harder to hear  or understand what he said. But other than that, I would recommend taking his class. </div></div></div></body></html>
