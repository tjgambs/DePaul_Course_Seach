Likes to talk alot but she knows so much.  Really easy going, but you still actually learn stuff.

She is so helpful in German class. She speaks mostly in German, but in a way even beginners can understand. In 101 there were four chapter test total and four workbook assignments, but that's realy all - it's easy and educational</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an outstanding professor, I would highly recommend her if you are interested in learning about German.
