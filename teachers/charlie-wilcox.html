    I took his intro to game design for non majors class. Definitely recommend it, a much better arts and lit credit than many other offerings. He's so cooky and down to earth and just a fun guy. Kinda sucks that he assigns so many things and has so many essays though. Could be worse I guess. Still recommend it, he's not the worst grader.

    Great professor with great enthusiasm and charm. Class is not as easy as some may say it is but if you pay attention and do at least some of the reading you can get by quite well! Final is the best thing ever! You'll see!

    Easy class. Can get kind of boring sometimes if you're not into philosophy. He tries his best to make the lesson sound interesting. He's a cool teacher but I didn't connect with him well like some of the other students did, mainly because I'm not huge on participating so I never really got to speak to him personally. Still good teacher nevertheless

    Great professor! He lacks in returning paper feedback and grades to students before before having to submit the next paper. There is no way in telling what to fix in your writing until two papers later, which is a down fall on his part.... Otherwise he is very passionate about this subject... Take if you have interest in this class.

    He is a great teacher. I had no interest in video games before the class, but it was an easy way to get a philosophical requirement out of the way. No tests, and grades pretty easily on papers. Best final ever; you'll see if you take him. Totally worth it.

    Charley is one heck of a character! He's a very knowledgable guy and EXTRMELY passionate and quirky. You will learn some interesting things in his class to be sure. He also runs DeFRAG, so he gets major props for that in my opinion as well. He really does care about the students in his class, which is a really welcome change. Definitely one to take

    Teacher is not good. Ignore good comments. You read the book a lot and take 3 hard exams through the quater. You cannot understand him. He is a waste of time and you have to go to class. Do NOT TAKE HIM!!!

    This class seems tough at first with all of the deadlines and rules he has in regards to papers and assignments.  Yet he wants everyone to get an A and as long as you study for the quizes and write two decent papers, you will get an A.  Class lectures can be boring at times.

    This class was awesome. Charley made it a lot of fun, and was really open to discussion and other ideas. Structure: a few quizzes (you get a detailed outline of the questions), a couple papers, and final project. A lot of group work. A lot of fun in-class activities. He eally makes it interesting. His reactions and personality are hilarious.

    Charley definitely knows his stuff and makes it fun and interesting.I took this class as a DL student and could not be happier once I understood the way he taught.  He tends to teach topics that don't always correlate with the study guides. Don't get frustrated when you get study guide questions wrong because he told you something else.

    Charlie is absolutely awesome, he is hyper-active and passionate about gaming and technology. His parties rock and he is also hilarious. The class can be difficult at some times if you don't keep up with the homework, but if u arent a complete idiot and know how to use DLWEB you will be just fine.

    This guy is just great! Keeps you awake and gives easy homework/midterm/finals. Its all multiple choice stuff so all you have to do is memorize answers, doesnt get better than that. Hes picky on the attendance part, so make sure you dont miss more than 2 classes. Overall one of the easiest teachers out there. If you want an EASY A, look no further.

    Just study the study guides and you will be fine on the final and midterm. Don't worry it's taken word for word from the study guide. In the words of wilcox &quot;EASY&quot; and if you don't understand you will see why when you take his class.

    He is the most energetic professor you'll ever have, and is FULL of telecom knowledge.  It is very easy to do well in his course if you just show up and do the homework, and you still get a ton of information.  He is like a friend to students -- very kind

    By far THE BEST professor at depaul. The bottom line is that if you want to learn, you will learn telecom (and he makes it fun), if you just want to pass this class, you will do that with ease.

    Great professor. Very knowledgeable in the telecommunication field. Makes you learn by paying attention to class lecture and reading assigned chapters, but well worth it!

    He is awesome. A bit overwhelming at times, but I highly suggest to take this class just for the information sake. He is a genious, and will teach you a lot. However, he demands a lot of work, and a LOT of memorization. Not a blow off class. :-)

    Seriously the most interesting and knowledgeable professor you will ever have.  This guy can lecture for three hours straight and not loose you for a second.  You will learn so much from his class without feeling completely overwhelmed.  He is hands down
