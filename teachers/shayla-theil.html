Also, online journalism is a lot of material to cover in a short time, so she moves very quickly and doesn't go very deep into the subjects, but is very helpful if you need it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2006<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, easy professor!

Plus in terms of looks, it doesn't get any better (or hotter)than her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!

She is an adorable, bubbly, passionate teacher. All she asks is that you attend class, and  simply give a damn. She is more than willing to help at any time. Just give her the respect of attending class, and she will be more than willing to take care of you. She's such a pleasure!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: CMN363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Thiel is a very good professor.

The class was interesting, and we watched a lot of great movies and documentaries. She's really laid back and fun. You can definitely tell she has experience in her field and is very knowledgeable about comm. Take her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Thiel is awesome. She is one of my favorite teachers at DePaul. I'm not gonna say that she is super easy, because she will certainly challenge you. She grades fairly, and is generally pretty cool. She's my advisor now, I'm a big fan. The subject matter was really interesting and fun too. Participate in class, it makes it more intesting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2005<br>Class Name: CMN275<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: CMN275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Thiel actually made me want to go into journalism after taking this course. She can be tough in grading the individual assignments but I learned a lot from them. Overall, she's pretty cool. You should try and take a class from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: CMN275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shayla is a fairly good teacher. She graded kind of tough on some assignments, but felt bad about towards the end of the quarter and decided to curve some of them. Her lectures are kind of unclear, but if you glance over the chapter you will do well on Mid-term and Final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: JOURN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: CMN275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great prof-always willing to meet with students outside of class. assignments are fairly easy-midterm and final a bit tricky but just study a bit more. learned a lot, take it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2005<br>Class Name: CMN275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Despite her misleading youthful bubbliness, Thiel is a serious professor and expects nothing less than the academic best from her students- hence her tough grading for an intro level class. She really does care about her students, and treats everyone equally. Overall, Thiel is an awesome professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: CMN275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is very nice! fair grader and is very clear on assignments. midterm wasn't too hard as long as you do some studying. take her if you get a chance, always willing to talk to you and responds to emails very quickly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is great. a new teacher at depaul so i think she wants to make a good impression.  i think i got a d on the final and the midterm but i ended up with a b in the class.  and she remembers students too</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2005<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Thiel is great. She's extremely accomplished and a little intimidating, but she wants to be your friend. Ask for help and she will go above and beyond to give it to you. She loves getting e-mail. If you work hard, and let her know how hard you're working, you'll get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2004<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a pretty good professor. She knows what she is talking about, but it is obvious that she does not have much experience teaching. I do, however, think she is pretty tough at grading. Just do the work and you'll do fine in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes new, and so far not to bad, young and has good topics and examples of material. not hard if you study and read a little, although some people still managed to fail the midterm. i would recommend her and probably take her again. 2 short papers, midterm, final, and short in class writings.</div></div></div></body></html>
