    He is a good lecturer and pretty open to helping students, but he does not go all the way. If the class doesn't understand the lecture, he will just go on, and he will only help during office hours or when it is convenient, and he will painfully make you do all the work with minimal hints; however, the homework is fair and the class was good.

    it's math, not my favorite, nor am i good at it, but because of karl i passed with flying colors and the fact that we use my labs plus, but if you ever need help he is more than happy to help you! this class was a lot of work, but if you work your butt off and study the material you will ace it. trust me! math is my weakness and i aced the course.
