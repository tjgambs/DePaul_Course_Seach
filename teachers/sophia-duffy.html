Seriously among the worst professors I took at DePaul. She's always late, her lectures repeat the book, teach you absolutely nothing, and her exam questions are confusing. She isnt helpful either so dont waste your time asking for any. Steer away! Shes a cool person, but unless you're just looking for a friend, RUN!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2013<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I know this is said a lot, but she really is the worst professor I have had. Unbelievably difficult, unreasonably hard grader. She never tells you what she's expecting. Lectures are boring and irrelevant. Open book tests, but that doesn't mean they're easy. It's two hours of high stress as you look up obscure information. Would never recommend.</div></div></div></body></html>
