The professor is very nice. There were online homework, midterm, and a final. The homework was confusing and complicated, it makes you work on it. The midterm was okay if you study for the homework. However, the final is way harder than you think. Some of the question is confusing with the wording and it is very hard. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2015<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cook has been one of the best professors I have had at DePaul. I had her for MGT 301 and ICS 395. She is very clear when explaining the material in class and gives you powerpoints, she is a fair grader, and a fun teacher. Lectures are sometimes long but when there is an activity or competition involved you love it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2014<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her midterm is too long for the time she allows and she knows it, yet she won't change it. Book is not necessary to get an A but you need the online code, which is almost as expensive. Sometimes she wastes time on useless activities of guessing numbers and telling us the point 3 days later. Overall it wasn't a bad class- requirement outta way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2014<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Cook is a corporate professional who takes all of her previous knowledge about Op. management and forces it down your throat. I did more statistics in this class than in my Stats class. Granted, the class is about operations management but it often feels the information being taught is useless, unnecessarily complex, and not applicable outside</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, Professor Cook was one of the best professors that I have had at DePaul. She was always clear and concise and made sure that we knew what was going to be on the midterm and final. She has engaging in class activities but heavily relies on power points. She is a fan of the iClicker and takes attendance. Don't buy the book; it's not needed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is amazing. I leaned very useful management skills with her. I learned more business stats with her than in the business stats class! The online hw really helps! totally recommend her! Plus she is super nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cook was one of the best professors I had at DePaul. Her lectures at times were boring and hard to follow but everything she taught could be applied to the real world. Homework is easy points so DO it. Midterm and Final are easy if you study. There's no surprises just go over your notes. You don't really need the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cook genuinely wants every student to pass. She explains the subject clearly and gives plenty of in-class examples. Her &quot;exams&quot; (which is the midterm and final) are not hard - as long as you do the assignments and study. If you want to learn something, then this is the class. It's an easy A if you keep you with the work and attend class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2010<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down the best available.  Excellent use of MyOmLab, and very responsive and clear.  If you can get into her class (which fills up the first day) she is worth taking without doubt.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: MGT508<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a wonderful professor. She reminds me of Helen Hunt when she talks. Very helpful and very responsive to questions. She made us grad students teach a part of the class through real world experience. I highly recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2009<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was pretty interesting and we did fun activities. Don't buy the book. Only slightly helpful on the tests. Not enough for $200. Everything is on her ppts. She's not very good at clarifying things. Very general when &quot;helping.&quot; You have to teach yourself some stuff. 6 online assignments, midterm, and final. All in all, a good class. I recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2009<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class, online work.

If you put effort there, you will get a B....if you actually try you will get an A without the book. She gives you powerpoints for every chapter. Tough but great teacher! If you are willing to do the work she will teach you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2008<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS A VERY NICE AND CALM TEACHER.  IF YOUR WILLING TO LEARN YOU WILL ACHIEVE GREAT SUCCESS. READILY AVAILABLE ONLINE AND DURING OFFICE HRS. ATTEMPT HWK PROBS EVEN IF U DONT UNDERSTAND SHE LIKES TO C THE EFFORT. MUST DO HWK AND U WILL GET AN A ON THE TEST.. GUARANTEED.  DOES NOT TOLERATE CHEATERS.

Not alot of work required just make sure you can work with your group since most of homework is group work. Paper is time consuming, but you can atleast apply it to your company which makes it interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor, highly recommended. We fell behind & missed a few chapters at the end but learned a lot from what we covered. In-class activities are great to learn from; iclickers made it easy to participate; only used textbook for hw; lots of groupwork - be prepared. Only minus was the length of time it took to receive grades on assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The final was crazy hard. Even though she gave us a study guide, most of the problems on the final were not even close. Theres no HW, and all she does is read from the slides, so you have no idea what is really important and what is bs. She has good communication skills but is a bad teacher. Try someone else if you can...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great professor and the class itself is pretty easy.  2 exams (very fair, focus on lecture) and online reworkable exercises. She's always willing to help students, and no group work! Definately recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a hard class.  The online exercises prepare you for a lot of the exam and you have unlimited tries on them, and the study guides will help you with the rest.  Class was sometimes boring, but she tries to use the iClicker and activities to keep you interested</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2008<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good prof for MGT502, and I hear there are a lot of bad ones for this.

There are six group assignments/projects which take roughly 5 hrs for each one. She is very nice and helpful but be prepared to work your butt off.

She breaks everything down into simple terms.  I thought I would hate this class but she made it interesting. Her tests are lengthy but if you listen in class and do the homework, you'll be fine.
