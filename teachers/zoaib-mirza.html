Anyway, he is a teacher to be avoided. His in-class presence is distracting, he's glacially slow at getting to the material, and difficult to stay engaged with. I'm not a guy to skip class, but for his I skipped constantly for the sake of my own sanity. Thankfully, he's an easy grader and curved the class grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is very friendly but lacks clarity and organization. He did not spark any interest in the course subject. Very boring lectures that no one really understood.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I've ever had.
