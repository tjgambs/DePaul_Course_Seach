I wish I could have escaped when I had the chance. I dont know if ill make it out of here. tell my family i love them...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>I would HIGHLY suggest not taking Katie Flom. If you're a perfectionist like me do not take her. She does not give A's. She assigns busy work. She treats students like high schoolers too. She expects us to be in class on time, everyday and prohibits electronic use in the classroom. She is not an effective teacher and she lacks self-confidence.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hated her. She acted like a cool teacher but she is really strict and she assigned a ton of work. She is very unclear when she explains things and a very tough grader. She is terrible at answering emails and will cal you out if you ask a question she thinks is stupid.  Shes extremely rude and frankly a very poor teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard grader who assigns a lot of busy work. She is also not a nice person. Don't take a class with her if you can help it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst writing class I have ever taken. I felt like our reading assignments had the same, boring, repetitive message. We had essays due every other week, 250 word summaries of everything we read, and tons of reflections. Not to mention, her lectures were extremely boring!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed writing essays with Wrd103 but she just destroyed my interest in writing. Harsh grader. Doesn't clarify. Stacks up busy work. Her quizzes are difficult since she doesn't clarify in what we need to watch for in a chapter. Worst teacher I've had in a while.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: WD</div><div id="right"><div>The books were literally mandatory for this class so it was pretty annoying having to buy expensive, redundant books. Missing papers can make sure you get kicked out of class. Avoid if you don't want to buy the useless books!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Flom is by far the least clear of all of the teachers I have had, including high school. She starts class with her irrelevant chitchat and expects students to respond. Her directions are very unclear and she expects everyone to understand what she is attempting to say. On top of her lack of teaching skill, she was late in giving my grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Flom makes it very clear what she wants, attendance, participation, and whatnot. If you're willing to do those things she's fine as long as you're willing to try. She's not amazing, but as long as you care about your grade it will probably work out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awful teach. Very unhelpful and unclear in directions as it relates to her papers and assignments. Always in a bad mood.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2013<br>Class Name: WSD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She doesn't help you out at all. never responds to emails and HATES phones... I use my for school too and she was not having it. just pick a different class not worth it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first Kate Flom seems really cool, but as the quarter progresses she loses clarity. The whole set-up of the class is annoying and highly unnecessary. She spends the whole 90 minutes trying to stretch out the little content she came to class prepared with and she is rude about giving help. Overall tolerable but not a desired atmosphere.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures are ghastly. They start with her liberal lathered hipster-awkward monologue that no one responds to. Then she begs the class the to respond and threatens greades  Unnorganized, inconsiderate, uploaded grades once, yells at kids for using their phones and then uses her phone when you schedule a private meeting. D-</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not recommend her to anyone. She assigns very difficult papers then will waste class time by reading directly off the power points she posts online. Always had an annoyed attitude and clearly did not want to be there. If you want to feel like you're back in high school then take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's strict and annoying. VERY tough grader and doesn't explain assignments at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take Kate Flom. Piles on work and doesn't answer emails. Expresses her very liberal opinions in class which is very annoying in a writing class where you have to write about political issues. She tries to act like a cool teacher, but she's really not. Super strict. Don't do it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She piles on the work, honestly in the middle/end of the quarter a paper is due every single class. Its hard but participate and get on her good side.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice and interesting teaching method.

She always come in with a pissy mood and takes it out on her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is so strict, she doesn't know what she is explaining in the course. Tends to pile on tons of work with no time and doesn't help/explain when you need it. Avoid her class, shes a hard grader and she is really pissy. She might give you a better grade if you get on her good side.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tries to keep class interesting even when she sees the students obviously aren't.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great teacher.I had her for WRD which isn't the most interesting class, but she always made it fun. Very easy grader, if you go to class, participate, and do decent on the assigned work you will get a good grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Delightful personality, but had high expectations most of the class struggled to live up to. She tried really hard to keep us interested, but it ended up feeling like we were just chatting and looking things up on google. It could be kinda fun, but it was a pointless required class. So long as you do everything exactly as she asks, you're fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously, Kate's WRD 103 was probably - no, definitely, my favorite course this quarter. Her sense of humor and tangent-going personality are at times difficult to get used to, but if you seek her help, she is more than happy to help you. The fact that she works for the writing center also makes her super accessible. I think she's awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes really not as bad as everyone says, she just goes off on tangents all day and i could just sit on facebook all class. you have to go but theres no tests or quizzes or grades, it's all pertisipation based. i recommend her if you're looking for an easy class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought this class was a complete waste of time. Maybe because this class was the first year curriculum. She treat the students like children. I am pretty sure my grade was lowed because I constantly criticize her teaching whether we will learn anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's strict, but she's consistent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really easy to talk to. Though she is strict when it comes to her policies like attendance, bringing your textbook, copies of your essays for peer review, etc. Though she clearly states exactly what she wants, as long as you do it you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seemed like a cool and easy teaher at first..WRONG! GETS MAD IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE BOOK..TAKES OFF POINTS IF YOU DON'T BRING IT. ESSAYS EVERY WEEK. ONLY EXPLAINS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN THE ESSAY WHEN THE WHOLE CLASS DOESN'T UNDERSTANDS IT. ALWAYS, ALWAYS GO OFF TOPIC ABOUT HER OTHER CLASS AND HER LIFE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seemed very chill and young on first day, turned out to be harder than expected. Not too bad, pretty easy grader and nice, but pissy if you're ever late to class and tends to pile on a ton of work all at once instead of spreading it out.</div></div></div></body></html>
