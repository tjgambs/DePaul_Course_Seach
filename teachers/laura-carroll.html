    Laura Carroll did not communicate ideas well, and I found myself frequently confused in her class. She was also a rather harsh grader. Often, I did not understand why points been deducted. I don't feel I benefited in any way from taking this class. Overall, it was a horrible experience and a complete waste of my time.

    &quot;Laura&quot; told us this was her first college class, and we could tell.  She was INCREDIBLY nervous, and was very unclear.  While I felt for her, do not take the class.  She really doesn't teach much of anything - but grades tough.
