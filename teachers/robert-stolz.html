His lectures are not very organized and he jumps from topic to topic.  If you really enjoy learning about China I would suggest this class.  But do not take it as an elective if you don't have to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: HIST233<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought that he was an average teacher.  He knew the information well, but I had a very hard time understand him because he jumped around from topic to topic randomly.  I felt he was very smart but had a hard time conveying the material.  READ!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: HIST223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher.  Explains everything well in class, and covers history from both a textbook perspective and a &quot;from the people's point of view&quot; perspective.  Not a lot of work, but when the work does come around - it's tough, and really tests if you know the stuff (fairly) or not.  Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: HIST223<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a very nice guy and he is very understanding. there is a lot of reading but for the most part it is intresting.  there is only two exams.  he is ALWAYS finding ways to make you understand the material..he is highly recomonded.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2005<br>Class Name: HST233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Graduate student from University of Chicago.
