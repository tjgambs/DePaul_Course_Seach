It's a pretty easy class though and yes he wears plaid all the time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was the most boring class I've ever taken in my life.  He lectured for the entire three hour class on pointless things that everyone should know before going to college.

Very laid back. Loves plaid. Not that that is relevant...He does his best to make class interesting, which is hard since it is a writing class. I've taken writing classes before his class, but I feel like I actually LEARNED methods of improving my papers in his class. TAKE HIM! You will not regret it!</div></div></div></body></html>
