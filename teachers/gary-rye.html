I left one day after a 3 min trailer to LOTR, 8 min screamo song, and a 10 min Gregorian chant.Useless</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy but a terrible teacher. Laughably incoherent lesson plan. I learned almost nothing in his Sophomore Seminar class. He has very little confidence which does not inspire learning.
