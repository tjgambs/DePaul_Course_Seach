    Dr. Pierce is a genius, with that said she doesn't know how to talk to students or keep them engaged. She goes from topic to topic, and has a way of belittling students when their opinion or answer is not what she wanted. Her grading is tough and almost impossible to get feedback from. The subject matter is so interesting, not the worst class ever.

    Condescending, rants frequently about pop culture instead of sticking to course material. Very knowledgeable in history but highly apt to criticize those with a lack of knowledge in the topic. Unless absolutely required, refrain from taking her.

    Don't Take This Class. She goes on random rants during class and you almost never finish talking about a topic before moving on to the next topic. Best of luck if you take this class.

    All these comments are spot on.  She goes so off topic with these abstract, redundant rants.  LSP-200 prepare for a draining semester.  I advise pottery 100 or maybe smashing some pottery over your head before this class.

    Horrible teacher. Had her for Buddhism and it was the WORST class ever. Pick another religion class. Only take this class if you can stand a teacher who tears your self-esteem to shreds. If not, this teacher is not the one for you. She will make you feel like an idiot whenever you speak because she is so rude. RUN THE OTHER WAY.

    This professor is very difficult. She gives a lot of reading and essays to write almost weekly. Also, she wants you to write in a very specific way and if you don't you might get a lower grade. I managed to get a A- but it was not without a lot of stress and a few nights of staying up until 6am writing papers.

    worst prof i've ever had at depaul. if you don't write the exact way she wants, she will rip you apart. and you don't know what she wants until it's too late. she's horrible, she ran like 3 discussions and if you have a discussion group don't bother reading the other groups because participation is worthless.

    Horrible! At first I thought she was very nice, but I was very wrong. Her grading scale is nowhere near being fair. If she actually dies email you back, she is very rude. She was so rude that it hurt my feelings and I felt put down. I don?t understand how a school like DePaul would give her a job. I hope she is better with her next class.

    She is the worst professor that I have had at DePaul.  It's not because she's a difficult grader or that she is particular about writing style, but because she is incredibly opinionated and creates personal vendettas against students who openly disagree with her &quot;factual&quot; opinions in class.

    Don't do it. No, I'm serious, don't do it to yourself. Listen, I'm not exactly a slacker, but I have never been more stressed out then by this course. I cried -- tears and all -- to THREE librarians and went to FIVE different libraries in TWO days. And when I wrote to her in a panic, she basically told me I wasn't trying hard enough.

    Sucks that my 'intro' class to college was HORRIBLE. Seriously, she thought we were stupid, way too much writing, and zero feedback, just insults. She would always say look in your style guide, buy a style guide, blah blah. Stop trying to make up for your inability to teach by shoving a style guide down my throat. Not one person could stand her.

    She is one of the worst professors ever.  Super hard and there is no pleasing her, ever.  She is always right and if she asks a question and you answer it, you are still wrong.  DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE THE MOST STRESSED OUT PERSON IN THE WORLD.  Oh, and race is an illusion.  Tell her that.

    She's not awful, and she can be a lot of fun during field trips and even in class... cool person to talk to. But not a very good writer, hate to say - and extremely critical despite this. Hard to understand what she wants, contradicts self often... pretty silly &quot;rules&quot; and all. Not a class for english/writing majors... you will be FRUSTRATED!

    DEFINITELY a B. She was horrible. I usually love writing and topics about ethnicity and race, but she killed it. She has very aggressive &quot;teaching&quot; style, and her comments on returned classwork and homework (including the final paper with the impossible grading standards) were not constructive so much as insulting. TAKE HER IF YOU'RE INSANE.

    She is not the worst but not even close to the best. She is very unclear with her guidelines and gets MAD when you ask her to explain, as if the students are idiots or something. But, without touchign the textbook, I still got a B in the class. Not too bad if you have no other choice

YOU COULD BUST UR A** IN RESEARCH BUT SHE WILL NOT CARE CAUSE IF IT DOES NOT INTEREST HER IF IT'S A DIFFERENT OPINION FROM HER, THAN ITS WRONG. DON'T TAKE!

    i really did not mind this call all too much, but there were times i didnt open my mouth because i knew it would start a whole new topic of conversation i just didnt want to get into.  She took a while to get the final grades posted but other than that she wasnt too bad, swore quite often which was surprising at first.

    Lori was definately a challenging teacher, but she is also very sincere with her students.  She trys to be very strict at the beginning of the quarter so people drop, but towards the end it became alot easier.  If you dont want a challege dont take her, but if you do you will learn alot from her.

    Do not take this prof.  Even though she claims to be a history teacher, she sure acts like she is an english prof.  Not very friendly, talks a lot and very fast!  Kinda condescending.  I learned some, but stressed so much over papers.  She destroys them!

    Talk about an EGO.  This woman is TOO MUCH.  The entire class hated her and with good cause.  She is a new teacher at DePaul and thinks she's the cat's MEOW.  She's the only one who thinks she's an effective, great teacher/ person.  Don't take her ever!

    Dr. Pierce was extremely difficult.  Both in her stance and also in her grading.  Her emphasis is more on writing than on the material and she is hard nosed and a know it all.  The material was hard.  Avoid her at all costs!!!!
