Arlene teaches well and involves the class in discussion. I studied and did fine on the midterm and final. If you take notes, pay attention in class, do well on the project and tests you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2006<br>Class Name: CTH101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is class is boring, but easy. IF you are looking for an easy class, take her. She is very nice. As a project you have to go to a church and anaylze it. The mid-term is easy, she gives you the study guide and its like the mid-term, the finale is a bit harder, but nothing you cannot handle.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2005<br>Class Name: CTH261<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Catholic Faith and Music Expression is SOOOOOO BORING!!! Only take her if u want to FALL ASLEEP! Too many readings! She's nice, but she lectures the entire classtime. Your grade is based off of your midterm, final and a project of analyzing a church that she picks. I DONT recommend this class.</div></div></div></body></html>
