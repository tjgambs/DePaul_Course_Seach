Our discussions were ok, but many people who take this class are still in that high school phase where discussing sex is giggly and uncomfortable. It kind of ruined the class. The only good thing is that it was super easy and didn't take effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Um...how should i put this...he is a very interesting guy. He gets really side tracked and thats can be a good thing sometimes.  He grades on class participation and never lets you participate.  He is an easy grader and is overall easy.  he is just a little creepy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2005<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I HATED THIS TEACHER!! He's an A**! Don't take him...granted the class isn't overly hard, but it's definitely not worth it!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A, but very boring--He talks most of the time.  I never read the book or did the readings, but got an A on everything.  He is super nice, but super boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was such a joke. You do nothing in class at all but listen to him talk about women. (kinda weird considering he's a man) But it is so easy. I never read the book or articles and did well on the papers. All you do is write a couple 2 page papers, and that's it. Boring class, but an easy A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All around good guy.  The book is extremely boring, but he does try to include other things to make class interesting.  Papers are very open so you can write about almost anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher, excellent lecturer, and fun field trips.  Also very understanding, and final is take home.

It was a four hour freshman class, but it was nice to have such an easy-going class for my freshman year.  I would take the class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a cool guy.  He's understanding and lenient. The class I took was like four or five hours long.  So, he struggled to stay awake himself let alone keep the class awake.  We took awesome field trips.  He's a softy too.  Can't complain about that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, somtimes a little monotone, but intresting.  Work is somewhat easy, but this is an intro freshmen class.  Do the work, and come to class, you will get an A.  Would take again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He taught my Voluntary Motherhood class. He was so easy. I never read the book or the articles.  All you have to do is these little 2 page papers about easy topics.  We watched some very interesting videos too.  I recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the t.a did most of the work, hes sooooooo boring. really easy class not a lot of work at all. some cool field trips around chicago. very informative class.
