    Material taught very subjectively.  Exam questions are ambiguous and confusing.  Has a lot of experience in field but mostly in the past, his techological expertise is a little outdated.

    Nice guy, but time has passed him by.  Incredibly unorganized and a poor speaker.  Class was a real waste of time and money.
