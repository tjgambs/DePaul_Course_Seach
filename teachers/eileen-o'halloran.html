While she does assign a lot of reading, which can be discouraging because selections are also difficult, she really helps her students understand the text.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class!! She is very enthusiastic and loves what she teaches. However, she is not always clear on what she wants and what is going on in the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2013<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is extremely nice, but can be a tough grader. The more you participate, the more you'll get out of her class. Read the books, spend time on your papers, and ask questions. She is very understanding and generally engages students in discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Focal Point about Joyce/Beckett. Class could easily be 200/300 level and it is a lot of reading. One group project, two papers, journals every so often. The subject matter is intense, and don't expect it to be easy just because it's for freshman. Nice lady, very understanding. Do the reading and you'll do fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: HON100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I have had in a long time. An easy class, especially for honors, but still the most meaningful class I took. I looked forward to going to it every day. She is the type of professor who allows you to get out of the class what you put into it; I put a lot into it and feel very intellectually enriched as a result. Highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2011<br>Class Name: ENG281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Be warned, though. She grades papers with a critical eye. Before writing, you really have to think of your thesis and criticize it. Nothing out of the ordinary for higher level courses. I switched majors after taking this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2010<br>Class Name: WORLD105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not exactly a blow off class since she is a somewhat hard paper grader. All we do is papers, a presentation, and occasional quizes. Pretty helpful, my only gripe was I never saw her in her office hours. She's crystal clear, no accents, very easy to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely my favorite professor at DePaul thus far. I honestly felt like I formed a friendship with O'Halloran. She was always trying to interest us in a first-year mandatory writing class by letting us go outside, write about movies we love, or whatever. She truly wants you to do well in her class. Great professor, highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher! she works hard to keep the class interesting and she is always there to help. she lets you redo assignments because she honestly wants you to do well in the class. take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2009<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT TEACHER!  She is very helpful and very enthused about the material.  Grades fairly and allows for revisions.  She is one of the few good Honors professors so if you have an opportunity to take her, do it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2009<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. O'Halloran is terrific. She is clearly knowledgeable but makes sure not to lecture/preach at us.. She chose many interesting works to study for World Lit., and class was laid-back, informative, dynamic, and best of all-- she is always incredibly open to changing the format of any aspect of class if we begin a dialogue with her. Not very difficu</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2006<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Very, very helpful & clear. Explains all assignments & is always willing to help you when ever. Very involved by bringing outside sources & having class discussions.Picks interesting books to read & gives u enough time. Class presentations but are group & works with you.  Very fair grader-can easily get an A if u simply do the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher ever.  Extremely helpful and understanding.  pushes you to do better, very encouraging.  too bad she is taking a break from teaching to work on a book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's a nice teacher who doesn't give a lot of homework and will help you anytime regarding a paper or anything. she's also very nice in person, and teaches well</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
