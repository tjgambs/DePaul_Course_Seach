Long, boring lectures about politics and culture that only slightly wraps around Italian food. This course was an elective and required more reading and papers than my mandatory health courses. Regretting ever taking this course. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: ITA203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Caterina is a nice professor to her students. She is a tougher grader than other Italian professors but she teaches most Italian classes. Take her of necessary, she is not bad at all. An A is definitely possible.</div></div></div></body></html>
