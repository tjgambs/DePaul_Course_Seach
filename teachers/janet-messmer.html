That doesn't mean she isn't condescending and terrifying but she really does care about all of her students, both academically and personally. I always got good grades when I thought I did poorly and bad grades when I thought I did well but whatever, she really knows her stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2005<br>Class Name: SURVEY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I fought to stay awake during this class.  It's in the dark watching slides everyday.  But even going to class **** and high I still got a B+.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2005<br>Class Name: SURVEYTECH<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Janet was a hard teacher to please and not always nice, but she prepared me damn well for life in the theatre and as a teacher.  She was very generous and cared about the progress of her students- she even retaught a class with only me in it to make sure I understood the info.  Some of these responses have been immature.  She's an excellent teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: COSTUMING<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All I'll say is that the biggest part of her body is the chip on her shoulder.

She doen't listen and assumes to know what you are trying to say before you finish your sentence. She also encourages questions but when you ask questions bites your head off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2004<br>Class Name: SURVEY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a bitter old lady with a lot of usefull information if you can stand to stay awake through her hour and a half monotone slideshows.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: COSTUME<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2004<br>Class Name: COSTUMETEC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Janet might have been a good teacher a long time ago, but since her early days of teaching has become a cold-hearted, melodramatic person and terrible instructor.
