DePaul just handed him the Head of the position because they did not feel like finding someone qualified and he was here. He can't direct, he can't write, and he doesn't even try to teach. He just hands out passing grades, that's the only reason people like him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2013<br>Class Name: DC398<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a fun professor, but is a bit pretentious as well. He openly rejects anyone would ever shoot on film ever again (which is a spike to the heart of any cinematographer). He still knows his stuff and is fun to chat with. Class is unbelievably easy and he offers all the help you need to venture into the 'real world'</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh god, I love Matt so much! He's hilarious, and the sweetest guy ever. He is so incredibly passionate you can't help but be affected by it. To a previous poster... so what if there are posters with is name on it... he STARTED the film program at DePaul and he is the HEAD of the program! He's amazing, I can't wait to take another class with him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2011<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very funny professor who knows what he's talking about and clearly has a passion for film.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2010<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what they negative comments are all about.  I think he is great.  The &quot;school money&quot; he is using is for Project Bluelight, which is endorse fully by the school and the DC department.  He is a great teacher and I learned a lot in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2010<br>Class Name: DC271<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Um. . no,  He talked about himself the whole time.

Take the class from anyone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Friendly, easy, shows great movies.

This guy is using school money to make his own movies, and calls it education. . . seems like an out of control ego. There are posters all over school with his &quot;written by, directeed by&quot; self credit,crazy&#63; Try and avoid if at all possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2008<br>Class Name: DC371<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Matt was one of the best teachers I have had at DePaul.  His class was fantastic.  I learned more in that class than in any other course so far.  I will definitely make a point to tryÂ and take more classes taught by Matt.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2008<br>Class Name: DC1<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His critique of the student films at the end of the class was really brutal. Had something nasty to say about everyone. Why&#63; It was a beginning production class. He was not helpful. He expected masterpieces and great acting&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: DC270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Matt is absolutely hilarious.  His classes tend to be half blow-off and half really interesting. He wants his students to succeed and will trim down assignments/make them optional if things are getting too difficult.  He is truly a fan of film and seems to really enjoy teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2007<br>Class Name: CMN274<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Helpful.

His class goes by the syllabus and is very laid back about class. If all professors were like Matt, everyone would go to college. Keep it real, and do good work and you'll be rewarded for it, otherwise expect to get burned. Ask if he likes Sparklehorse. Class is easy, Midterm was a breeze GET THE NOTES</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2007<br>Class Name: DCDOC<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gotta say I was really into documentaries before this class. The whole class sorta turned me off.

You'll be well educated and entertained during lecture; he's very, very funny and handsome. On film critique days, he's completely unsparing with an unworthy product so plan to work. If you haven't tried he won't just fail you, he'll also publicly shame you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2005<br>Class Name: BLUELIGHT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives good advice and motivation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: F<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Matt taught a fun class and it was very useful for me! I did see how he would kinda**** on other students who didnt share his tastes.Also, he did give off the vibe of the guy who didnt get laid in high school and being a prof is his big chance to redeem. This one gal rejected him and he stopped loving her videos.  Pretty lame. Better prof than dir</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2005<br>Class Name: DC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Totally cool.  Those that respond negatively are probably the ones that didn't care about the class to begin with.  And the sexual harrassment&#63;  Give me a break.  I'm a woman and I didn't for one minute feel that.  All I felt was Matt caring about this area and the students involved in it.  Best teacher I've had at DPU!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2005<br>Class Name: BLUELIGHT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whether he &quot;made it&quot; or not.. he likes what he does.

He's a director who didn't make it and now he teaches at a University. He's not a good teacher and he certainly doesn't care about the students, or teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2005<br>Class Name: DIRECTING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm in the same class as the one below.  Matt rocks.  His class is great.  Overwhelming with information at times but he's cool enough to make sure EVERYONE understands it.

I disagree with the comment below!  I have learned more and had more fun in Matt's class than any other one at DePaul.  The guy knows his stuff and is very constructive with all his comments.  He seems to genuinely care about his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: DIGCIN<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>as far as teaching goes Matt doesnt know where to draw the line, unprofessional at most times, this is the acedemic world, he should remember that. I did well in his class and he is an ok person, but he needs to keep it more professional and less flirtacious with the females. knows his stuff though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2004<br>Class Name: DCFOUNDATIONS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, funny, very helpful and laid back.

BUT he needs to figure out if he wants to be a teacher or a director.  He comes off as very charming but at the same time he is a little too opinionated for his repertoire.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2004<br>Class Name: DIRECTING<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes cool and funny.  Nice guy.  Good sense of humor.  Doesn't care how you get projects done as long as you get them done.  You should have some DC background before you enter the class.
