Exams and assignments are graded fairly, just need to show her that you understand the subject and always back it up with examples. So smart lady, I highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2014<br>Class Name: MGMT472<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class and this prof! She has a way of connecting the material to real life and uses a lot of her own examples from consulting to demonstrate how certain processes work in the "real world." I loved coming to class--she kept it interesting. She was always available and made time for me. Great class--would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2014<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice lady and tells good stories but goes through the notes fast and expects you to write down everything she says. Powerpoint is only an outline and she doesn't tell you that everything she says will be on the exam. There was no review session. Graded papers hard. If you pay close attention you should be okay.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2014<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although the class was a lecture hall, she did a good job engaging the class. I thoroughly enjoyed her and the class. She said she would make some of us switch to Communications major and she made me switch.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2014<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Jaime's Com 101 class and loved it. She is an amazing woman and professor and I learned a lot. Take her class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2014<br>Class Name: ORGC251<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor! I took her for an intro level class and she got me interested in Orgcomm. Her classes are fun and she has a good balance of course work paper, exams, groupwork. I never felt overwhelmed with this class. You watch the office a lot and your paper analyzes the company from the show so it is actually kind of fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2014<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED LOVED LOVED her class. She grades the papers sort of hard, but I'd say the grades are fair. If you go to class and actually take notes, you'll pass without reading the book. The powerpoints she posts online are only the outline, you have to fill them in with the lecture. You won't do well if you don't take notes, or just read the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: ORGC357<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher! She has fun and interesting projects and assignments. Some of them are hard and require a time commitment but they are worth it. I have taken her twice now and I've been satisfied both times. Do your readings and make the most of the class. She is not a very hard grader, just pay attention to rubrics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2014<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is awesome!  She taught the second half of this class and she made it interesting for every student.  She is a very easy grader despite what others said.  Attendance isn't mandatory, but believe, you will always look forward to her class and want to come.  Take this class for an easy A and to learn alot about communication!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2014<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor. CMN 101 is taught in two parts, and she taught the first half. Class consists of lecture then at the of the half a paper and midterm. Fairly easy, just come to class, pay attention and take notes and you should be fine. No surprises and I personally found the subjects she discussed really interesting. good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a 101 class but she grades like a grad level class. I went to all the lectures and took notes. Got a C on the paper and a D on the test. She goes off tangent a lot and lets students go off tangent as well. There is a lot of information for this class. Ridiculous how tough she grades for a 101 class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2013<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved her examples and how personal she made her class. Really enjoyed class discussions and she made all concepts very clear. Our midterm was pretty easy and its because of the case study she gives you. Definitely would recommend her to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2013<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Charming lady. Definitely knows what she's talking about. Encouraged class participation to apply concepts. Offered A LOT of extra credit. Seemed to grade essays kind of hard, but I learned a lot from her and enjoyed the class. She was always very helpful. Responded to emails VERY quick. Used lots of videos to jazz things up. I'd take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely adore Dr. Bochantin!! She is truly an inspiration to me and made me change majors. She really cares about our education and is so passionate about Communication--it's contagious! Love, love, love her! The midterm paper was super hard but she gave great feedback and I was able to learn how to improve. She made me want to come to class!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC357<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bochantin was the best professor I have ever had! This was my first online course and I had the best experience! She was helpful, attentive and responded to emails super quick. Her power points that were narrated were very useful. I highly recommend! I am such an awesome negotiator now from this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2013<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bochantin comes off as a great professor and really easy but does not focus any of her final on the textbook. Additionally, she gives what she's looking for in a paper and when you do that, she'll give you a B- at best. Not a great teacher because most of her powerpoints were not even included on the final. Too hard for a 100 level class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2013<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you haven't taken a class from Dr. Bochantin, you must. She is absolutely the most wonderful professor I have ever had! This was an inrod class which I was dreading but she made it lively and engaging. She's so smart and you can tell is really passionate about her field. I changed my major because of her. Only had two papers and two exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best.Professor.Ever. Seriously--Jaime is one of the highest quality instructors I have ever had. Super cool, laid back and very enthusiastic. I have taken 4 different courses from her during my time at DePaul. I wish I could take all my classes from her. She is very smart, knows her stuff and keeps class interesting. Funny stories.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2012<br>Class Name: CMNS549<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Scatterbrained and made poor use of class time.  Talked about herself--a lot.  Fairly easy and interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't care for her, but I can see why people would like her. Definitely did not engage me in the material, although it was an intro course. Her grades for my papers (75-80) definitely did not match up with my test performance (90-95), so if you are not a communications major, beware. Very approachable, however.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's pretty awesome. Teaches from PowerPoint. Really liked her class. Wish it was longer than 5 weeks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a good teacher. Lectures aren't as engaging as the first half of the class, but she gets you to think about it. Too many video examples for my taste. She actually cares about your education and that's a major plus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: CMN001<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jaime is awesome! Best teacher I have ever had at DePaul! I switched my major to CMN because of how interesting she makes the material sound. Super cool and laid back. She's really funny and relates the material back to the class. Only 1 paper and 1 exam in her half of the class which is great. I never missed a class or wanted to-she's the best!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2012<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jamie is an easy teacher and there is only one test and one paper to write for her half of teaching the quarter.  She is really nice and helpful out of class and makes the class fun.  I would definitely take another class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2011<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm so glad she only teaches the second half of the class, if I had to sit through anymore of her lectures talking about herself the entire time I don't think I could've taken it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2010<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teaches the 2nd half of CMN 101 about organizational communication. A pretty boring subject, but Jaime makes it somewhat interesting. Tries to keep thing relevant with office clips and other movie clips to demonstrate concepts. Overall, an easy professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2010<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She taught the second half of the class and she was really nice. She gets done really quick and is really helpful. However, her lectures are super boring. She isn't that engaging but she is easy. Expect to watch a lot of The Office.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was nice.  The class was easy and I would recommend taking it. She goes off on feminist tangents and it's annoying but whatever.  All in all a good professor and i would recommend the class. you learn a lot and it's not hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2009<br>Class Name: COM101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had her for the second half of the quarter, talk about barbie. The class is easy and she posts the notes which is nice.  She always gets off on tangents about how all language should be gender neutral...REALLY annoying. But she means well and she's clear, not a difficult class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Would definitely take her again--one of the best teachers I've had.  Really nice, easy, and clear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really nice and easygoing. But, she repeats the same things over and over and talks really fast and it gets boring pretty quickly. For her half of the class you have to do a case study and take the final. Pretty easy overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2009<br>Class Name: CMN251<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an amazing professor!  She gives real-world examples all the time to keep us engaged.  She genuienly wants her students to do well.  She is super young too (in a good way)!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome!
