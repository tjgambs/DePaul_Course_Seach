He's kinda funny and dorky all at the same time.  His lectures get boring FAST, but he's a pretty easy grader and he makes the class not bad for philosophy.  He's pretty strict w/attendance and quizzes though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2004<br>Class Name: PHIL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Selcer can be compared to TV Seinfeld's Kramer, or better yet the guy on Mad TV who is addicted to coffee.
