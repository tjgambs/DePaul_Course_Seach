Recommend conferencing with her as her classes can run over on time and she does overpack her syllabus a little. Grades a bit harder than average, but if you take her class seriously you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This course was specifically about post-colonialism, so she is very passionate about it, but if you aren't don't take this class. Not very clear lectures and sometimes doesn't get to the point at all. Lots of short papers and quizzes though, which can either help or hinder you depending on if you do the reading.But I liked it as a basic ENG course</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2013<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too many quizzes and they're all really hard!!

Do not need to keep up with readings, just skim the last chapter assigned will keep you in good standing. Very understanding if you are having problems, and very easy to communicate with, but expects a lot of work to be done.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of reading and a lot of writing!

I had to spend most of my time doing work for this class, than all my other classes and let me say I have Bio 7 hours a week. She's a nice professor but expects way too much. And since she is typically an English teacher she's a tough grader on papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Please do not waste your time!

Class isn't an easy A - she will make you work and improve your writing (But isn't that the point&#63;)  Quizzes are easy if you do the reading; papers are graded moderately hard, but not unreasonable.  Would highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2007<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I never went to class, missed a couple quizzes, got A's on all of my assignments, papers, quizzes etc and still got an A.  Keep up w/ readings (she quizzes almost daily) and turn everything in and you'll be fine. Research paper is easy, too.  Don't fall behind.a</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very nice lady.

She is very pleasant and understanding. She isn't an easy grader on the big papers but if you put in an effort you'll do really well. The reading is a bit heavy but it's pretty interesting. I'd recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is ALOT of reading for this class.  Easy to get behind.  Quizes are very detailed. Papers were not easy and shes not an easy grader.  If you like to work for your grade, then I recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice lady.  Class is very boring though... Doesnt make you feel like you have a lot of homework but the research paper is EXTREMELY tedious.  She is also a very very very hard grader.  There is no way you can just 'wing' her final drafts.  Also her comments on your drafts arent helpful...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Goffman is a great professor. Yes, she's a tough grader. Get over it. If you really want to improve your writing, take her. It is especially helpful to take it freshman year because it polishes your writing for other classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mmmm...I don't know about this one. Her voice annoyed me and she graded fairly hard on 2 page papers we had.Offers rewrites that often don't change your grade much. Only assigned one book to read for the class. I guess I liked her but didn't find her to be an extremely knowledgable person on the subject.  It could have been just me but I do not thi</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2005<br>Class Name: ENG281<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher who loves what she teaches. This class required 5 books which all needed to be read from cover to cover in order to pass the quizzes which were very easy if you read. Class was easy because I read and the bigger tests and papers were easy as long as you know how to BS your way through it. I would recommend if asked to comment about it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was easy!!!

She allows you to do rewrites on most papers, however I think she grades the originals quite hard. I don't know if anyone got A's&#63; I only saw A-'s.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not organized at all, she has no idea what she is teaching at all.

Discussion does get a bit boring at times, but Goffman is a sweet, helpful lady in a motherly sort of way.  Papers were graded pretty easily and the pop quizzes actually forced me to keep up my reading. She's not amazing, but not terrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Goffman's so sweet and runs the class really well.  The whole quarter we all sat in a circle and had discussion time, which made class itself really easy.  She's not too tough of a grader on papers and other than some trivial in-class quizzes, class is a breeze.  She's light-hearted and never stern.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DePaul hit the jackpot with Goffman. You couldn't ask for a better Professor. The all 6 of the books that we read were interesting. The papers were frequent, but easy. Do a draft and let her proof it and you should get an A, if not you're an idiot!!!  I love this lady!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2004<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a tough grader, but you can revise your papers for a new grade- she's very very helpful (she'll read emailed drafts of papers etc.)a very nice woman and interesting book choices</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2004<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her more than I expected to.
