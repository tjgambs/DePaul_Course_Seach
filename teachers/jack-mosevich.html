Class was 50% midterm, 50% final, but both were very doable if you came to class at least once. He reviews everything in the class before the exam and the material is relevant and applicable to many of our future careers in finance. Definitely take him, he's worked at UBS-Wealth management and 3 hedge funds. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2014<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is more about theory and applications than the mechanics of finance, which I really appreciated. Professor Mosevich is a really reasonable teacher, I enjoyed his class more than any of the other finance courses I have taken at DePaul. I will be taking another course of his next quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2014<br>Class Name: FIN562<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most caring Professor at DePaul. Midterm 50% and Final 50%. Another 5% for an optional presentation. He tells you what's on the exam. Take him and you'll not regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2011<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There were only 2 tests which were mostly writing definitons and a few problems which are very easy. He tells you exactly what's going to be on the midterm/final from each chapter. There is one optional presentation on a topic of your choice during the last class for extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2011<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher.  He's monotonous but keeps the class moving with his humor; but not joke-a-minute either.  Gives you exactly what you need to know for the exams (Mid-term 50% Test 50%); Liberal grader and gives the opportunity to earn a bonus 5 pts with a presentation.  Could not have learned Investments any other way. Take this guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely take him. Class consists of midterm and final. He tells you EVERYTHING that will be on the exams a week before. I barely took any notes and I got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: FIN335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class. He can get a little boring at times but if you take notes and pay attention to what he writes up, you will do fine. His reviews basically tell you what you need for exams and hes always willing to help. Very nice and helpful guy. Very highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: FIN335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this class.  The grade is 50% midterm, 50% final, with an option to do an extra-credit presentation.  My advice is to do the presentation..it's good practice for the real world and can boost your grade.  Take this class after FIN 330.  The professor is intelligent and funny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2010<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Another Great Professor from the Finance department at DePaul. Prof Mosevich has tons of real world experience. At first it might seem like he is a little disorganized but I can assure you this Prof knows finance and you will learn useful things!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2010<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First impression was that he would be boring and monotonous but that changed when the class started. Definitely has the experience (almost 30 yrs in the financial industry). He's got a great sense of humor. Very helpful and is easy on test grades. Sometimes he'd ignore arithmetic error :-) as long as you get the concept, you're safe.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2010<br>Class Name: FIN562<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is great. Really funny but only if you listen closely.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2009<br>Class Name: FIN335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I never rate professors b.c. I just don't believe in everyone having the same experience but OMG this guy is amazing and everyone has to know it.  I will tell you all how to get an A in his class. I got 100% on all 3 exams. You memorize the definition b.c. he asks for the def, not the term and then read, and do examples from class and  HW. Easy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: FIN525<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Almost done with the program, and I would have to rate Mr. Mosevich as one of the best. He has a ton of real world examples. His tests are fair, and he is always available for help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: FIN617<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart man who knows his mathematics.  He is also a very nice person and grades very fairly.  I would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: FIN335<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class. Goes through material rather fast, but his test are really easy. Doesn't teach you anything that you shouldn't already know. Everything he teaches, you should have already learned in FIN 330. It's a pretty easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely boring and monotone professor. His tests are easy but his teaching style is almost impossible to comprehend. He moves really fast without explaining much and his voice just puts you to sleep. However, his test are pretty straight forward, just read the text and practice some problems and you're set. I got an A without putting much effort</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: FIN525<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very monotone and his class is not very exciting. he teaches mostly out of the book. exams are fair, hes a nice guy but its hard to pay attention to him talking for 3 hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2007<br>Class Name: FIN335<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great guy and very considerate.  Keeps everything simple.

He is by far the most caring professor when you need help.  He is always available in his office and is probably one of the most knowledgeable professionals in his department.  He also has over 20 years of work experience that he involves in his course</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: FIN337<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows the subject well but has no clue teaching it.

SO I am sure this will be a very helpful class for finance student if he changes the text book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: FIN527<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is AWFUL!
