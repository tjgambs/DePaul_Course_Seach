He is a really nice guy but it's not apparent that he really cares whether you learn or not. He just goes on and on with his lectures, writes tons on the board and we can hardly keep up. Prepare to teach yourself the material. Ah, and no tutoring offered for this class :(</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2014<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>is unorganized, jumping from slide to slide, makes mistakes on the board while students are trying to capture what is possible then erases portions and changes to something else. Explains by saying here we have this or we do it like this. Contradicts to his syllabus, forgets to post on d2l. I understand finance and he gets me lost. AVOID !!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2014<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class. Professor is very knowledgeable and passionate about finances. He does everything for his students to succeed: gives quizzes, which help to prepare for exams, provides handouts, extends deadlines. If you donâ€™t do well in this class, it means you did not put any effort. I learned a lot and I would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2014<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>Worse professor, class is not structured, exams are completely different from material taught in class. I am a straight A student, first C in grad school. Thanks depaul for wasting my $4k and leaving me no smarter than i was before this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a horrible and frustrating experience.Exams do not reflect what was taught and if there are questions that resemble something we learned,it was complicated to an extent that was just unnecessary.There was a midterm, final, weekly HW, and 3 horrible case studies-just an unreasonable amount of work. Professor is unreasonable and short-tempered.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2014<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID this professor.

Cannot reach out to the students. What's worse is the grading mistakes he made on the quizzes. He's constantly confused and confuses the students. He's also very discouraging and disrespectful. Do not take him! This comes from someone who got an A- in his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2012<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Granted this is a finance class, the professor will be less sociable and won't entertain people. He was a decent teacher in terms of giving us the equations then we solved them. However, he failed to relate the course work to the real Financial World. He doesn't have the passion to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2012<br>Class Name: FIN617<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The reviews are accurate, horrendous professor.  Can't teach, exams are incredibly difficult, fails to relate any topics to real world.  Take any other professor, this will be a total waste of your time and money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2012<br>Class Name: FFIN617<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>tough exam !! aviod him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: FIN617<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most of the reviews are accurate. Smart guy, absolutely cannot teach. Exams are incredibly difficult, almost laughable. Constantly confusing himself and the rest of the class. Avoid if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2011<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took the night class once a week. quizzes almost every meet. the MOST random questions. syllabus is useless, doesn't state what we will do each week. First C(+) i ever received because i never had any clue on what to expect. Teacher is ineffective at his job. Never would i take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2011<br>Class Name: FIN557<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know how he teaches undergrad courses, but most of these negative comments are correct. His teaching ability is nothing but questionable, or even worse. He makes grading mistakes all the time, confuses himself all the time, which in turn makes students more confused. I would never take his course again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fair grader, not extremely difficult class.  Karim wants you to learn the material, he is also very helpful.  Welcomes students to utilize his office hours to discuss lecture and ideas.  give partial credit on MC questions if you argue the concept.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>took this prof for International Finance. Used book all the time. weekly quizzes, two longer quizzes and a long final. Really difficult material, had to study tons outside class. Learned a lot tho</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For this class we had 2 quizzes a final, a spreadsheet assignment, and myfinancelab hw. What the professor teaches in class really doesn't prepare you for any of the exams, it more of a general lecture about the chapter. If you do your myfinancelab hw & book hw you should be fine. You also get one cheat sheet for an exam. Fairly sight forward class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he really wants to teach his students, very passionate, gives more than fair grades. Take him. He is very knowledgeable, so if you are majoring in finance you must take a class with him, you really learn!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>depaul has an extremely diverse student body, and its teachers are just as diverse, you have really really good professors, some okay ones, and some really really good ones, going to a school like depaul, you don't always get the chance at a truely EXCELLENT professor. but in this case you do, if you get the chance to take his class DO IT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hes extremely intelligent & hard professor.  But fair. and you MUST pay attention during the lectures.  If you are not prepared to read, take notes, and study, don't take his class.  If you think that teachers can explain everything you need to know in class without you making connections on your own drop out of college.  Hes an excellent teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away from this teacher. Took his class and he is hard. On his quizzes he would make us write why we choose a certain answer on a multiple choice test. Then he had us work on papers explaining topics in Finance and graded pretty hard on them. He had us get Aplia and it was extremely hard and non of the class material was on it. Don't take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2009<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy and knowledgeable, but doesnt transfer that info well to the students. Majority if not entire class were lost and for exams you feel completely unprepared and helpless. presentations which are not graded but for fun... I assume he curves the final grades. You will not learn much about the subject which is a shame because it is interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2009<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you can sign up for this class, try getting Randall Fisher rather than Prof Pakravan. You can tell that he knows exactly what he's talking about and he knows the material, but he really can't trasnfer that to teaching the class. He's pretty disorganized and tests are impossible, I wouldnt receommend him. Does have a pretty good curve at the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2009<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed being in Prof. Pakravan's class. He is extremely knowledgeable and very helpful. Just a group project and a take-home final. Topics were very interesting. Great class! Great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2009<br>Class Name: FIN557<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All if the negative reviews are spot on. He knows the material but can't teach it. Demands allot from his students but he delivers such a sub-par teaching experience that his expectations feel ironic and even unfair. He is very un-organized and will include material in the test that he said he wouldn't test you on. Will make mistakes grading exams!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2009<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NO... NO NO NO.  RUN as fast as you can away from this man.  I am a straight A finance student and I currently have a D average in the class.  This man is nice, but is the most horrible professor.  Mandatory attendance, Aplia, Textbook, iClicker, the works... Don't waste your money or time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2009<br>Class Name: FIN557<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor goes too fast and he is always confusing himself when working on problems, so don't use pen!  Tests are difficult and he will put questions on the exam that covers material that was not supposed to be on the exam.  No curve but the class was interesting, I would not take Professor Karim for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2009<br>Class Name: FIN557<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In the class now. Nice guy; however, totally absent minded. Not worth the tuition and not up to par with graduate level courses.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2009<br>Class Name: FIN220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Pakravan is a good professor. I don't understand those bad ratings... he is very nice man and will help you. exams are easy and he curvs ... take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Pakravan knows what he is talking about, but doesn't quite know how to transmit this information to his students. You will be teaching yourself a lot of the material. There are two quizzes (20% each), myfinancelab homework (20%), and one final (40%). The final grade is curved, which helps A LOT!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am planning to be a finance major but Prof. Pakravan does not have strong teaching skills and mumbles while speaking.  He will not motivate you to learn or do well.  There two Quizzes-worth 20% each, weekly homework assignmets-worth another 20% and one final-worth 40%.  He is the worst professor I have ever had at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2008<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy who thinks hes talking to colleagues. He knows what hes talking about but cant convey to class. HARD GRADER! First C ever at university level! tests are virtually impossible and isnt clear on what he wants from you. I wouldnt recomend him as a professor for fin 320. overall, high expectations with little instruction or guidance...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is definitely a nice guy who knows a lot about finance, but his teaching style is not that great. He uses the book and Aplia (website $35), and curves the final grade, which helps a lot because his exams are not that easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: FIN557<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is undoubtedly brilliant and well-published and has a wealth of experience in the field, and is also a pretty nice guy, but unfortunately he does not translate it well to the classroom.  I had high hopes of learning a lot in this class and was disappointed.  I would recommend taking a different prof if you plan to take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: FIN557<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is very, very smart. i encourage everyone to talk to him outside of class, because he truly has a wealth of knowledge and very approachable. i enjoyed his class and felt like I learned a lot from him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2008<br>Class Name: FIN557<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>CHAOS!

Not very willing to explain things beyond his first attempt.  If you don't get it you should just read the book.  He made grading mistakes on every exam he gave.  Not sure how because they were scantron but he did.  You might learn a bit but it will be from the book and not class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2008<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
