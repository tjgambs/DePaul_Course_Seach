He cares about substance and not quantity. You will emerge with very clear concepts. Questions on the final were a bit different than the prep guideline but I guess the grading is quite reasonable. Overall a good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2012<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Challenging class, but in a good way and I learned a lot. Provides practical examples to all topics without tons of math. Keep up with the reading and homework. One of the better instructors I have had.

If you don't understand the lesson after talking to him, you'll never get it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2011<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Frank is an awesome professor, one of the best that I've had.  He does an excellent job of explaining the material in a relatable manner and keeps the class as interesting as possible.  There is only a midterm and a final but he lets you bring in a note sheet for both exams.  I learned a lot in this class and would recommend him to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2011<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  Understands that most of the class isn't in an economics profession.  Exams are tough,  but you'll learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2011<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with what everyone else has said. Very straight-forward. His classes are enjoyable for the most part--he knows its a dry subject but tries to make it interesting. Just two short papers and two exams made up the grade, but his suggested homework problems were very helpful come exam time. I'd definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2010<br>Class Name: ECOM555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a straight forward teacher and for a subject that is extremely boring he makes it fun and only teaches things he feels you really need to know.  He is fair and understands we dont work at the Fed Reserve like he does.  Beyond that he looks like hes 26 years old!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor, great class, and plus he is total eye candy.  Has that young hot professor look - often unshaven scruff, in his business casual outfit, hot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher. Not an easy class, but interesting. His tests are mostly analytical and he's not an easy grader, but he throws a curve, so in the end you're okay.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Limehouse is easily accessibly and always tries to give examples that the class can comprehend.  It is a difficult course, but he teaches it without calculus which makes it bearable.  There is a significant amount of reading/homework but you are only given a midterm and final.  I would take him again for Econ.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and has tons of real world experience to make Econ fun and interesting.  One of the best teachers I had at DePaul. You need to go to class bc there is so much material covered. He makes you want to learn the foundations of Econ so you can apply it. A+</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've at DePaul.This guys gets it and understands his students.Doesn't teach all the calc involved..why teach it if you're just going to memorize it for the test&#63;The tests are challenging, but in a good way.  If you pay attention you wont have a problem.Never a dry moment like with some of the other MBA profs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2009<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor who really knows his stuff.  The course is very difficult unless economics is your thing.  Calculus is barely used, which is a good thing and he lets you out really early every class.  He keeps class interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: ECO398<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty cool prof.  he's not full time but try to get him if you can.  he knows his stuff.</div></div></div></body></html>
