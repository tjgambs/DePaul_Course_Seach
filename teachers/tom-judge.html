His Discover class was a lot of fun. He also has a very laid-back approach to teaching. He does extend his classes a lot though. He often likes to keep people longer in class to finish a topic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm loveee this man!! He is by far my favorite teacher I've met at DePaul so far. Discover was a breeze with him; and even though it was easy, it was extremely rewarding.  I hope I never lose touch with Tom. Please take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2008<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is by far the greatest man at DePaul. He'll become your teacher as well as friend.  For Discover Chicago, he made it so much fun. When you hear what the other classes have to do, you'll laugh because Tom doesn't expect all that.  You will love him.  Everyone at Depaul knows him too.  You;ll talk to him until you graduate</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great guy. cares alot about his students and keeps in touch even after the course is over.

Grades easily, but mostly wanted attendance to be mandatory. I missed a few classes and still got an A. Never returns emails, and that bugged me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2007<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor ever!

Very easy. Likes to get to know EVERYONE. If you have the chance to take one of his classes take it. He loves to help people. His class was a blast. Just ask anyone who had him, and if they didnt like him thats bc they're a LOSER!</div></div></div></body></html>
