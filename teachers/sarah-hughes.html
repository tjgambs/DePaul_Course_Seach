Super easy going, but definitely assigns a lot of papers and readings. Encourages participation. Gives you extra credit for going to the writing center, which was a win-win. She is always willing to give feedback and I advise you to take advantage of that because it is really helpful. 10/10 recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2015<br>Class Name: 103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy going and nice - she'll sit down and help you out if you're having trouble.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>I loved her, she made me love reading and writing, and actually her class helped me realize what I really love, I actually changed my major to journalism. She gives easy homework and there's alot of time in class to work with groups. Super easy going teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is honestly such a gem! So nice and such an easy grader, I'm no writer and people said WRD 104 is hard, because of her I kept getting A's on everything, she's so easy going and loves having the class communicate and come together. Send her your essay you'll get some great feedback! Extra credit from the writing center. I recommend her 100%!!!! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was really nervous about taking WRD 104 as I am not really a writer, but professor Hughes made it really easy. You can send drafts of papers to her and she will respond with what you need to fix to get an A. She's a really easy grader, and you can even gain another 2.5% of your grade by doing extra credit. Doesn't drown you in homework either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2015<br>Class Name: 104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Its impossible to do poorly in this class with all the writing center extra credit offered! Her feedback is extensive but really helpful I'm making me a better writer. She's understanding if you go to talk to her. She's best to reach during class. She really emphasizes the editing process. Class discussion was really engaging! Great teach!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>The reality is WRD 104 is a typical freshmen level composition course. Chances are if you went to a college-prep there might not be a ton of new content. Discussions are engaging, and professor takes longer to produce QUALITY feedback. Worth the wait. Prof Hughes gave extensive consideration when I asked for help with assignments.
