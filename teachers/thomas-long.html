Their were only 4 assignments which were all pretty basic and self explanatory as well as a final project that wasn't too hard. He is an easy grader and attendance was not mandatory so never went to a class after the first week. Would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: IS201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor!

The course was 40% HW, 40% Term Paper, and 20% Presentation.  You could work in a team for the term paper and presentation. We analyzed selected case studies each week and were responsible for submitting a case study analysis via COL. Take DL if you can. Good content.</div></div></div></body></html>
