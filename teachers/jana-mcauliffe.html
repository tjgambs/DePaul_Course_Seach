I believe it is dry and boring.  Overall, it is very easy, so if want a class that you can sleep with eyes open in, take it.  I think multiculturalism could be really interesting, but I don't think that she does a good job making it interesting.  But, I'm a commerce major, and not programmed to think philosophically.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2007<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class could have been a lot more interesting.  the texts used are mainly feminist writings...if you're not a feminist or familiar with feminist theories this class will be a challenge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice class, clear and very helpfull, a teacher that makes you think, but is understanding.
