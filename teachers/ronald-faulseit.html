    He's a really good professor. Very nice, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about archaeology, but not really available to talk to if you need help, but that's understandably so, he works at the Field Museum too.

    The class was too early for me, at 8 am. But besides that, all is good. He has done some on-site work, so he really knows his stuff. He is super nice, if you ask him questions he will help you.

    He was a great teacher, i really enjoyed his class. We did a lot of fun labs and he told you exactly what was going to be on the tests. There were some long boring power points, and a couple of essay assignments but that is to be expected, you are in college.
