    Missy is one of the best teachers at DePaul (BY FAR).  The information she presents is great-- varied material and it directly applies to teaching.  Will use almost everything I learned from her in my day-to-day teaching.  Fantastic teacher!  Wish she taught more classes!!

    Loved this class!  Received practical information about teaching from someone who's actually in the classroom!  Missy is nice, down-to-earth, and very helpful (gives qualified advice).  Sometimes the discussions seemed to get a little off topic and were somewhat unstructured, but great class overall.  Would definitely take another class with her!!

    Missy is a fantastic teacher who provided us with super insight into the real world of teaching. She is smart, sensitive, and easy going. I would take her class again in a heartbeat.

    Overall, great professor.  She is a very fair grader and her assignments actually pertain to what is going on in the world of education.  Very helpful with placing you with a cooperating teacher to get observation hours done.  Only thing she can talk forever so don't ask for help at the end of class, email her!

    Wow! Finally DePaul hired a Prof who can teach us. Missy is very practical and helped us with stuff that we will actually need in our classrooms. I would recommend her to anyone!! She is the first Prof in my 4years here, to ask me how I am and to talk with me personally. She truly wants to help us to be good teachers. TAKE HER CLASS!! IT'S GREAT!!!

    You must take a class with this prof! Finally DePaul made a good hire. she is so practical and goes out of her way to help her students. She does things in the class that we will actually need to know for our own class rooms. All professors could learn from Missy Smith, she is just fantastic!!!!!!
