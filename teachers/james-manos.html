    You will learn to hate and love this guy at the same time. Extremely passionate about philosophy, lays it out on the table for you very clearly. He has terrible handwriting, so get your paper marks clarified. He will make you read, but you will actually learn something. I took him twice, loved every second of his classes. Amazing professor!

    I love love love Manos. He is witty, opinionated, super smart and edgy. He's a badass in a good way. What a refreshing class, and what a refreshing style to teach it!  If you're tired of boring professors who do just about the minimum to get you through 10 weeks then take Manos. He is absolutely incredible.

    Oh my God I can't say enough good things about him. This guy is willing to take a stand. Unlike other professors he is willing to challenge students into transforming their thinking. I have learned to see the world in a different light ever since I took this course. Do yourself a favor and take this course with him. It'll be an eye opener for you.

    He's simply brilliant. He has challenged my way of thinking so much that I can now say I have the ability to see the world in a different way. Sounds exaggerated but, who/where else are you going to have that happen to you? Stick with the class and the readings: they are totally worth it.

    I love when he tosses his hair to the back. Not only he's hot but he's got an edge too. He's simply brilliant. And engaging. Makes you think. He can turn any topic and make it extremely interesting. Lots of readings but your knowledge level expands tenfold. Great class.

    My God he's so beautiful! And brainy too. His method of teaching is brilliant: he lets students lead the class. He has no power trips, he moderates and encourages discussion. A very empowering class IMO. I learned so much from it. Highly recommended.

    Professor Manos is my favorite professor I have had at Depaul so far.  I'm pretty lazy but he challenges you to make you engage in the material, he really makes philosophy interesting.  Really put a lot of effort in the papers and your golden (4 paper, midterm/final which are take home and you get an A)

    The man is a GOD! He works you to death, but you learn so much from him. It opened a new world for me. This is a must experience type of instructor, he is amazing. Be prepared to work hard and be aware of what is going on in the news. He is brilliant.

    This instructor is ridiculous. As an introductory philosophy, this is an extremely difficult course. Manos is a VERY hard grader. He needs to tone it down for a PHL 100 level course.

    Professor Manos was my favorite professor of the quarter, thought I must say I have never worked so hard for the A that I received. The topics in class make you think and are interesting but the writing assignments are extremely difficult at times and he's not kidding around when he says he's serious about the work. I enjoyed his class overall.

    I took this focal point by mistake, and it may be the best mistake I have ever made. I wasn't interested in the material, but the way he makes you think is worth taking they class, even if it is difficult. Everyone likes a challenge.

    He's extremely smart and knows his stuff. The readings were boring and long, but when he explains it in class, it all makes sense. The key to passing the class is taking detailed notes!! the midterm and final is take home. ALL THE ANSWERS ARE IN THE NOTES! THAT HE CLEARLY GIVES IN CLASS! If you take good notes, youll get an easy A. No textbook; PDF

    great professor. totally changed my outlook at the world. he is very passionate about teaching which is refreshing. Sometimes did in-class quizes, some take-home, midterm and final paper. Very strict with midterm n final but if u take accurate notes, you would do fine.

    Prof. Manos was one of the best professors I've had in three years at DePaul. He challenged me to think in new ways and completely changed the way I look at the world and academics in general. He is one of the few professors at DePaul who will make you work to get to the next level. You will love him if you're serious about being a thoughtful human

    Yes, he is a hard teacher, but a great one. I was one of the ONLY freshman but I ended up getting an A because I read the readings, worked hard on the papers, and saw him for extra help. He's very understanding and helpful. If you want to learn, take him. If you want an easy A, take someone else.

    Wonderful Professor. Instills in his students a sense of awe and wonder of the world through philosophy. He's hard if you're lazy, easy if you put in the work. You come out of his class with a new appreciation for philosophy.

    Most of the comments here are laughable.  &quot;Boohoo, wah wah, I'm paying $30,000 and I got a teacher who actually made me do work!  Oh dear heavens what ever will I do&#63;&quot; Yes, his class was hard.  But he wants his students to learn, and the best way is to work hard.  Read the material and attend class.  It isn't that out of this world concept.

    Nice guy, just don't act like a know-it-all in his class. The class is VERY hard, so don't take the course if you've heard friends describe their PHL-100 class as watching videos, talking about feelings, and receiving an A no problem.

    Yes, his class is hard. Yes, he is a tough grader. But his passion for philosophy makes it all worthwhile. You will definitely be rewarded if you put the required effort into his class. I didn't get the best grade in the class, but I didn't care. I'm almost considering double-majoring in philosophy after taking Manos' existentialism class.

    At first I thought that I would hate Professor Manos and this class but by the end I did feel like I had learned something and that my writing improved. His attendance policy is pretty ridiculous and if you do not go to class frequently do not take this class. This is not an easy class but a possible A/B if you work hard.

    Don't take him if this is your first ever philosophy class or if you're not really into philosophy. The subjects hard enough as it is and he expects you to fully understand everything that's going on. He's a cool guy and he tries to help you out but he's a really tough grader.

    I would say he's more of an Ewan McGregor in Trainspotting, sort of heroin-chic kind of a look.  Never have I been more interested in philosophy, and he really makes things relevant to today, politically and otherwise.
