It really did provide the fundamentals of design, and give me a much better understanding and road map to follow when I start a design process.  You won't understand the relevance of any of it for a while.  But if you really pay attention Jeff's going to turn your life around in a very positive way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: DES101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jeff is a silver fox!

A little vague when giving instructions but is very helpful when you ask questions. It is like intense arts and crafts and makes you think outside the box.
