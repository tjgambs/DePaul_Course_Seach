    Ugh.  He is such a boring boring boring teacher.  I don't understand why there are happy faces for him.  He does not teach anything outside of what is written in the book, but still requires attendence in class.  A freaking waste of my time.

    This class is quite easy to get an A in IF you do the following: READ (not skim) each chapter as assigned, study the vocabulary, AND complete the 3 assigned homeworks. Yes, the reading and homework is time consuming (so learn time management, duh), but not difficult. Those who failed or found him too &quot;hard&quot; are slackers. Study=easy test=good grade.

    Im not sure why people are stating his class is not hard. This class is extremely HARD for a 101. It is very interesting and 3 papers are easy, but the exams are HARD! You have to study and attendance is mandatory.

    I thought he was a good teacher. He helped me with some questions I had and cleared them up. He also gave us TWO extra credit papers we could write instead of one so we could boost our grade. I thought the class was interesting and he made me laugh

    Easy enough class.  Just keep up with reading... no hard studying required really, just read through the sections.  The workbook really helps a lot.  He is quite generous with grading; he even allowed more extra credit because he felt the class needed it.  2 required &quot;papers&quot; are a piece of cake- just answering questions.

    I liked Dr. Schaefer. The material was very fascinating, had 2 papers and 2 exams. THe papers weren't hard but beware of the definitions on the exam. They can easily add up to a letter grade difference. That's why I suggest keeping up with the reading, in addition to the class notes (good notes too not crappy ones) and you will get an A out of him.

    This was a graduate course and I really truly felt like he gave me a better grade than I deserved!  He had fun videos to watch, we skipped a few classes for one reason or another, and he let us go early every night we had class.  I think he was one of the best teachers ever....maybe it helps that he used to be the Sociology chair!

    He is kind of annoying and the class is boring. The book does not get interesting until half way through it. It is an easy A if you spend hours studying the text(I would suggest the work book also, saves time) and he does offer extra credit. The class is not good or bad just a class. Spend time knowing all the vocab, words terrible grade scale.

    Schaefer is a very nice man and he tries to make the class exciting, but the material is introductory material, mostly definitions; So, I think he does the best he can with the material he has. Just beware your grade is only based off of 3 tests. They arent excruciating, so if you study, the class is an easy A. Plus there is easy extra credit.

    The classes only seem long because he lectures for an hour and a half but at least the material isn't that hard and somewhat interesting. He's a sweet old guy that cares about what he is teaching. He also gives you extra credit opportunities! There are only 3 tests but not bad at all!

    I loved the class at first- but it became harder and harder to stay awake during it. If you do take his class, make sure you have a couple shots of espresso in you before you go. His tests we're only easy after some serious reviewing and I could do without the monotonous voice..

    You folks are failing to mention that this man actually wrote the textbook. Open the front cover and you'll see a picture of his smiling Irish face. Yes, this man knows what he's talking about and saying that, you know that his lectures won't deviate from the text b/c he wrote it. Study hard, ace it

    Schaefer is so boring! The fact that he wrote the book and STILL has so much junk to say makes his class so boring.  Everyone fell asleep in this class.  One midterm, a final, and two papers.  Tests consist of 60 MC and identifying terms.

    Prof.Schaefer unfortunately wrote the book. Honestly my 12 yr old brother could write a better book than he did.The worst part about it is he rarely tested over the material we covered in class. Most test questions were obscure details from the book.

    One of the worst and most not understanding teachers I have ever had- plus his class could not possibly have been any more boreing. He wants himself and reads out of his own book. Maybe he needs some alone time.
