He can get boring, no doubt, but all you need is a cup of coffee. Take good notes, listen and you'll learn. Don't miss out on review days (extremely helpful for the exams).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2006<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy to do well on tests, just show up for class and review his blackboard notes.  But he is super boring, shows no emotion.  Half the class doesn't even show up, not to mention the ones that leave at the break during the night class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2006<br>Class Name: FIN320330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is awesome.  Uses real life examples and is super helpful.  Take this professor you will learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2006<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although he can be boring at times, he's really clear about what he expects from you, and he was really fair. He'll help you out if you need it; it seems like he wants to do everything in his power to help you get an A in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2006<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this professor. He is clear on what he wants and expects. If you go to the class and pay attention I think you will do fine on the test. It is an interesting finance class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2006<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor likes to use current events to explain topics.  For some of the examples he shares his work experience.  This helps because the textbook is really boring.</div></div></div></body></html>
