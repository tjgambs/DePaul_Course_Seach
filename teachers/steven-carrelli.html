    Steve is excellent. He rambles, but he is incredibly knowledgable and passionate and cares a lot about the subject and each student's improvement. I basically took this class in high school two years ago, but taking it again with him was well worth my tuition because I improved my skills significantly and learned a lot.

    Very nice guy! I took him for my discover Chicago class. The class was alot of fun the first week. But once we got to the class room it got very boring. He talks way to much and goes off topic alot. The books you have to read for the class are hard to understand and are not great books.

    Very helpful! I definitely improved in drawing through his class, he comes up throughout class and gives you tips and advice on how to better your drawings which actually help! Talks a lil much, gets lost in what he's saying sometimes but still is super helpful. He is a good grader too, not one of the "nothing is ever perfect" type.

    Prof. Carrelli definitely had enthusiasm for the class and discussions, and was extremely knowledgeable about the topics he lectured on. My only complaint is that it is impossible to understand what he wants in a paper (content wise), and will grade harshly on grammar or spelling mistakes.

    fun class and challenging projects.  He expects perfection, but he is very interesting and has a ton of information.  Critiques are very useful.
