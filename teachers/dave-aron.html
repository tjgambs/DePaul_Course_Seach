Take him if you can. Not a lot of homework, plus a take home midterm. Super nice guy and seems to want to help. Also, a rare thing at DePaul, he knows what he's talking about! Can get tiny bit boring with PP slides, but he changes it up every other class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: EXPMARK<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Half of your grade is based on groupwork.  If your a close minded **** like me don't take it, it will be tough.  The teacher is a good guy.  It was a little difficult at times but a great class to take if your interested in business. Overall I am glad I took it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: MKT320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall good teacher!! He's very understanding and cares about the students. Midterm and final were take home...really easy!!

Group projects can be annoying since you hafta meet every week. Assignments are redundant. Goofy, sometimes funny. Sit in the back if ur a lazy, non-perky kind of person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2004<br>Class Name: ADV<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had an in-class internship w/People Magazine!  Devoted all time to it, but experience was worthwhile. Midterm was open book, and final was take home.

Note of caution: not all of the power point slides he discusses in class are included in his hand outs, so you have to pay attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2004<br>Class Name: MKT320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, very sincere but can be kinda goofy sometimes</div></div></div></body></html>
