He is easily in my top 3 best professors. His lectures are clear and he makes it very easy to understand. There is a short quiz every week but it is very similar to the non mandatory homework (which he provides answers for). I would take him again in a minute. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2015<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bill Qualls holds clear, straight forward lectures. He uses a lot of examples from his job and other situations he has observed and found useful to his class. Do you homework and work on the study guides for the midterm and final and everything should work out just fine for you. Be sure to have a TI83. He uses it all the time.</div></div></div></body></html>
