I wrote an essay on a topic he was skeptical about but he loved it because I wrote it successfully. He is not your HS teacher who loves when you use fluff and BS. I strongly suggest taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Some say that he is rude or disrespectful, and he may be sometimes. But he motivates you to use FACTS and INFORMATION and the class was very interesting. The negative comments most likely came from people that handed in papers with little to no logic/facts. Use logic/facts and don't be dumb. He's witty and funny and would probably win at jeopardy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he was horrible. barely taught anything just about different fallacies. never really helped out on papers, just told you that you were wrong, and would probably tell you to start from scratch. too sarcastic. pretty rude comments on papers. don't take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is pretty easy. Yea he is sarcastic, but it is not that bad. There are about four papers and they are very easy to write. They are peer reviewed and then he collects them and gives them back with exactly what to change. If you correct what he told you to you will get a good grade. Do NOT be late to turn in the final paper. I almost faile</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: WORD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes he is sarcastic and no you can't disagree with him or you will be made fun of.

The only people that complained about him in class were incompetent writers who were lazy and barely showed up to class or were just highly sensitive. If you care about writing, he is an excellent teacher to have. His critiques are challenging, tough and extremely helpful. Plus, he is very attractive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>103 and 104 were the exact same syllabuses. he gives 4 papers (three pages each), and grades you pretty fairly.  then it's just a portfolio at the end of the quarter that you submit 3/4 papers, and you can make all the corrections on them that he made on his initial grading.  overall really easy, kind of funny, + worth taking over another professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he really embarassed me one time in class... he shuts down comments and made fun of me once for something about one of my papers. hes very sarcastic. i was so worried about being picked on in class i was never excited to come to his class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny as hell, laid back and cool, gives fun assignments, not hard to get through the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2007<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>will kind of seem like a jerk, but is really a good teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is great.

It's unfortunate most of his ratings are so negative, but it's probably because most of his students are freshmen that are used to having their hands held during the whole writing process.  He has an awesome sense of humor, too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Who ever wrote down there before only liked him because u think he is &quot;hot&quot; FYI he isn’t.

A fourth of the class failed and I heard that in another class half the class failed until he curved the grades.  Try to stay away from him for your own sake.  You need to be almost an english professor yourself to pass this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class seemed cool, until the grades came back</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, people who give him a bad rating are just the students who were complete morons and didn't know how to write.  It's not the professor's fault that a bunch of freshman who came into his class didn't know there were other punctuation marks besides commas and periods.  Awesome professor with a great sense of humor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: ENGLISH102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very vague with what he wants with you for papers.

He's a great guy... sometimes he takes everything a little too technical, but that's just because he knows too much for how young he is.  I would honestly say that if you were to take this class, you'd become smarter. About 3 quizzes; essays every week, but they're not too hard. Be honest</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a pretty fair teacher and knows what he's looking for.

If you just read the paper assignments and do what he asks, the class is easy. If you have questions, just talk to  him. If you talk to him about assignments, he seems to grade you easier. Don't bother doing the readings. Go to class though, then you get an A for participation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's pretty easy for the most part.  He likes people who's writing style is more personal than professional.  That made this class easy for me.  Some say he's cute...but he's liek the nerdy cute.

The assignments were intresting and he allowed a lot of leaway in the papers, which was nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the first day of class I was so excited, he seemed intelligent and cute...last day of class, he made my life a living nightmere for a whole quarter.  Do not take any of his classes, he thinks he knows everything and his opinion is the only right opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class, interesting ideas and teaches in a discussion format.  Pretty critical, although in a trying-to-be-helpful way, and his students tend to not care/participate in discussion for some reason.  Extremely unclear in assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely thinks he is the smartest, most interesting person ever to grace the face of the earth.  OK grader, but the assignments are pointless.

I've never gotten less than an A in Eng but he gave me a C. Thinks he's smarter than he really is.

He assigns &quot;pop&quot; essays, which are essays that you would find in Rolling Stone and Playboy, stuff like that. He's unclear at times about what he wants and takes long time to ask questions, though.</div></div></div></body></html>
