I loved this woman, shes nice, easy grader, and very genuine professor. There is a good amount of writing, but everything is laid out for with no surprises. I recommend her and would take her again in a heartbeat. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2015<br>Class Name: 200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is an easy A if you show up, do the papers, and participate! Nora is a smart women, and I really enjoyed her class! It's a great class! You will learn a lot! I would take Nora again in a heartbeat!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Nora Murphy is everything you want in a teacher. She is lenient with due dates, but clear with criteria. She keeps you for like half of the alotted class time or shows good movies. This class is the best LSP 200 to take. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Nora Murphy slays me. She is so nice and kind and really passionate about teaching. LSP 200 has a lot of papers, but Nora makes them super doable. Test criteria is VERY CLEAR. and she lets you leave early most days.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nora Murphy is such a sweet lady. She makes the class interesting & fun and is very engaging with her students. Papers are so easy, basically just writing about your story & your opinion on things. We watched a lot of videos and there are weekly quizzes on d2l, which you need the book for. If you need to get you LSP class out of the way, take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  Lots of writing.  Great discussions.   She uses Ted talks and video clips and we also work in groups a lot.  Fun class.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this class!! It is the best way to get rid of the lsp requirement. Nora isn't the most organized and we basically watched movies every class. She is an easy grader and there are no tests. But attendance is a big portion of your grade and you must buy the book. Overall: It was a fun blow off and she is very sweet.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2014<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Nora is the cutest. I took her Queer Chicago Discover Class. I absolutely loved it. Super interesting and fun! She is an easy grader and a sweet sweet lady.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2014<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Nora is cute. I took her Discover Queer Chicago class and loved it. Some of the assignments were unnecessary and a lot of it felt like busy work. Also she relied a lot on the student mentor and other teaching assistant, so she was not always teaching the class. Overall a great experience and a very easy A. Just watch your grammar in writing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She is super nice and the class is very easy and interesting! She doesn't really explain assignments very well though but if you just try you will do good. She is pretty picky with writing though, but overall the class is very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wanna get rid of those pesky sophomore multiculturalism seminars? Take her. Granted, there is alot of writing, but she isnt exactly stringent when grading. The tests are a bit tricky though. And you will points by missing class. And she is a nice lady too. An A is not exactly out of reach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She''s amazing. I had her for my Discover Chicago:Queer Chicago class. I must say i don't think i will ever take a class as fun as that one. She's very personal and loves to get to know her students. We called her by her first name.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a really cool person and an awesome councilor, but not the greatest professor.  The class experience was fun, but she sometimes seemed unprepared/wasted class time.  Additionally, she doesn't make expectations for assignments terribly clear and many students thought her grading was somewhat inconsistent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof, extremely helpful during class and even more so during office hours!!  Definitely recommended, new students take this class with her!</div></div></div></body></html>
