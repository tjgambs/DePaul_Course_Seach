I'm not a student who falls asleep in class but this one did it. I strongly believe that she focuses on material that is irrelevant on the tests. Most importantly, she does not hand out study guides. It's horrible when there's 100+ pages worth of information that will be on the test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You're required to get 2 texts but I suggest you only get American Promise. Her tests are difficult because she does not give study guides. Plus, the class is truly based on how good of a writer you are. She grades you more on your writing skills than the course's subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this class. Extremely boring and the assigned readings were way too lengthy. Any opinion that differed from hers was automatically wrong, especially in papers. She's a sweet lady and passionate about history, but I definitely would not recommend this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher was difficult to understand and her lectures were difficult to take notes on. She acted off in class and was absent on several occasions. On the last day she was over 20 min late and was confrontational. She was reported and escorted out during class due to her off-putting behavior.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2012<br>Class Name: LSP201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You need to keep up with the reading & there's a lot. She's pretty fair, though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2011<br>Class Name: HISTO181<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a terrible teacher. She comes in every day and gives a lecture that's impossible to take notes on because it's overall lack of clarity and organization. She assigns two books which she gives you no time to read. Her tests are impossible even when you know the information. Avoid this teacher. The subject matter is cool, just not her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>2 words? STAY AWAY!!! The class consists of reading 4 lengthy boring novels, watching movies and taking unclear test and quizzes. AVOID!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid - even if you like history.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2010<br>Class Name: HST370<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was hard, but I learned alot more than in other history classes. She can be abrasive but overall she is a pretty nice lady. If you dont like reading then dont take the class...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2010<br>Class Name: HIST269<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough but fair. Too many jerks in the class slowed things down.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2009<br>Class Name: HST269<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good teacher. Lots of reading but you can get by without doing it. very nice, funny</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2009<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Eslinger really knows her subject very well and is extremely passionate about history. Although the class seems a little scary with all the reading, it is not that bad. Typically we review what we read in class each day. There are only 3 tests overall in the class which isn't bad as the questions are taken right from the notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2009<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked her.  She's a very timid teacher but her personality comes alive when she discusses the revolution.  She really has a passion for her subject, which helps to engage her students in a subject that not all people enjoy.  She tries to introduce you to reading the textbook along with scholarly analytical essays (make sure you read!)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2008<br>Class Name: HST181<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a tough teacher, but a fair grader. I had 2 tests and final which helped spread out points. However, there is no other aspect of your grade outside of the tests. She really likes history and as long as you come prepared to class and participate she makes it interesting. She is funny in her own way because she is such a history enthusiast!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2007<br>Class Name: HST269<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smart but terribly snobby. If you like to participate in class, don't do it in her class - all she'll do is insult and belittle you.  The class was a complete waste of my time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2007<br>Class Name: HST101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't know much about the topic, but the readings were interesting. You absolutely need to keep up with the reading. Not many tests, but the questions are ok. She made it come alive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2006<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay, granted the two test a quarter thing isn't too great, I thought she was very clear on what she wanted. Shes very smart and I thought encouraging in class. As long as you do the readings, which are boring to an extent, and as long as you pay some sort of attention and take some notes, you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2006<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very intelligent women,but the fact that there was only two exams in the entire class really sucked.  Especially if you are not a test taker.  The exam covers like small details of the readings.  So all the studying feels like a waste of time, althoguht i enjoyed teh detailed information in readings...it still sucks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2006<br>Class Name: HST280<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i guess you can say she knows what she's talking about. but sitting through class.. she barely covers anything that you were told to read over. she only hits certain situations, that to me seemed irrelevant to the chapters we were told to read. i don't like how there's ONLY 2 tests ALL semester. midterm and final. i'd retain more info if quizzed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2006<br>Class Name: PUBLICHISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Smart but kind of moody, overall very helpful.  High expectations but gives a lot of leeway on the reading. Overall good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: HST371<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rude,and loves her own knowledge...and hates any argument that goes against what she feels. If you have a choice...don't take her, and if you're forced...good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2005<br>Class Name: PUBLICHISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can never answer a question correctly, because she will respond by telling you about her degree or say that you dont have enough experience in the field.  We are students, not professors!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2005<br>Class Name: HST269<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was just very strange. Her mood changes drastically during every class period. She's really sarcastic and funny at times.  No one in the class participated because the materal was so boring.</div></div></div></body></html>
