This is not an easy class whomever teaches it so you have to have some type of discipline anyway.  Work hard and ask questions and you can get an A in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2006<br>Class Name: SOC350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked her as a professor. She is very picky about paper length and content. Don't include unrelated material into you papers. I got an a in the class though anyways. She is great at leading discussions and I would definetly take her again. She is also very understanding if you have a problem or a concern.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2006<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Run!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: SOC313<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>On a power trip. Felt like a 4th grader. Is VERY PICKY when grading papers. Thinks very highly of herself and laughs at students. A terrible guide in discussions. Materials were good. If I didn't read them I wouldn't have learned anything useful. She has favorites and changes the rules for them - couldn't figure out how to be one and play her game.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2006<br>Class Name: SOC411<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kinda ****, speaks very fast and randomly picks kids out of the class to answer questions like we're in grade school all over again.  The articles she has you read are a billion pages...and written by her!  Not a fan of this course or this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Either she doesn't like teaching or doesn't like teaching at DePaul.  She's not readily available to ask questions and her answers are confusing.  Too bad I have to continue this with her for another quarter.  She is awful indeed.  Look for someone else to take research methods.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awful steer clear of this one</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2005<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely difficult.  She really doesn't explain concepts so that you understand them.  Terrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2005<br>Class Name: SOC412<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She obviously has a passion for Statitical Analysis, but is unable help students grasp the subject matter.  If you take her class you made need to be by her side through out the course. Also be sure to have an understanding on obtaining a data set.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is helpful and the inclass conversations are nice, but i think that the questions on the midterm were a little not specific, and i think that the 4 papers that we had to write did not have a specific enough subject, and i did not know exactly what she wanted.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: SOC380381<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not ready to be a teacher at the univeristy level. SHe is too sensitive and not objective enough to students opinion. She needs to grow up and stop trying to be above her students. She shoudl realize that they are at the level she is she just recieved her Ph. D.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2005<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2004<br>Class Name: RACE<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher. Just read the material and you will get an A on her tests. She literally just takes informatio from the books and forms them into questions and puts them on the midterms. So pay attention and do the reading and you'll do great. Attend class and participate in discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2004<br>Class Name: SOC380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DON'T LET HER FOOL YOU WITH HER NICE PERSONALITY. OF COURSE YOU EXPECT RESEARCH METHODS TO BE DIFFICULT. BUT YOU ALSO EXPECT THE TEACHER TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THE MATERIAL AND SHE DOES NOT. WHEN THE WHOLE CLASS DID POORLY ON HER MIDTERM SHE BLAMED IT ON THE STUDENTS INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT HER SELF</div></div></div></body></html>
