    The professor was incredibly knowledgeable about the subject matter. The class was definitely hard but the material was really relevant. I feel like I actually know how to hack something now, kind of crazy.

    The professor cannot even teach the class himself he needed an assistant to come in. He grades subjectively and unfairly. The assignments and exam questions do not reflect course topics fully and in fact are extremely difficult in comparison to the toy programs he demonstrates. I was one of the lucky ones who did get a B. He cant teach.
