    He's a funny guy, there's a photography assignment every week. Downside: School doesn't provide cameras so if you don't have a DSLR camera already you're going to need to buy one ($200-). There are lectures that he doesn't post online so you need to be in class for those. The class is recorded so missing class isn't that big of a deal.

    Overall good professor. Class was 5 two page reflections, midterm, final, and participation. The class is really easy but you have to show up because the exams are based on the slides and notes he gives in class. Write everything down he says or presents. Exams were open notes and I got 100% on both. Don't bother with the book you don't need it.

    Prof. Erpelding is great!! He's really chill and a good lecturer. He really gets to the point and is super clear about what is expected and what the class is going to be like. He's also a fun lecturer and you can really see his passion for what he's teaching.

    This class was a lot of fun because it made you watch some movies you would never watch before. It teaches you a lot about the general film making styles. There is a one page paper a week on the movie you watched in class and two papers for midterm and finals about a movie you pick and one from a list he gives you. Fun class.

    Best beginning photography teacher ever! Weekly photography assignments don't require a fancy camera as long as you put in the effort. Easy A as long as you show up to class and follow the guidelines properly. No textbook required, either.

    Craig is the best! He really knows his stuff and treats students like adults! His projects are fun to do if you're into the subject and he's really laid back with lectures! Tests are easy too- he writes everything down in the power points. Taking a class with him again because I love him

    I've taken him for a couple of classes and he's a great teacher! He's helpful, nice, and really knows what he's talking about whether it be film or photography. He's a pretty easy grader and gives lots of extra cedit opportunities. He really wants everyone to learn and to do well in his classes. Take him if you get the chance!

    He's pretty laid back guy, and he knows film. If you're taking Foundations of Cinema, I highly recommend taking his class.

    Weekly 1-page essays, plus a 4-page midterm and 6-page final. Classes start with a discussion about the last film watched, an easy, short lecture on the next topic and then a movie. Very fair grader and knows a lot about film. While not a philosophy professor, he does well getting into philosophical issues. Take this class!
