Exams are challenging but fair, and also have extra credit. Flexible with due dates, and not too much homework. I was scared of taking CSC 321 after hearing some horror stories, but I actually enjoyed this class. This guy knows his stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2013<br>Class Name: CSC400<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good lecturer, generally very clear. Uses the textbook more as a supplementary reference. Homework was mostly obvious extensions from lecture, with some more challenging stuff thrown in. Mid-term was similar to the homework. The final was much more conceptual, testing more theoretical understanding of the material-challenging but fair. Good teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: CSC400<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him for Grad lvl Discrete Structures class. I found he taught the subject well and the homework wasn't easy but fair. The midterm wasn't to bad but the final was BRUTAL. I had a solid "B" in the class and got a "C" b/c the final. Definitely plan to study hard for his final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2010<br>Class Name: CSC421<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't provide course lecture notes. Has difficulty in explaining topics. &quot;Is it clear&#63;&quot;. Tends to verbally challenge students who ask questions...But he is responsive to email and grades generously.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2009<br>Class Name: CSCXXX<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I've ever had anywhere.  He does not follow his syllabus at all, which is breach of contract.  He also does not prep us properly for exams, including putting material we didn't cover in class on exams and Homework.  When he grades, he does not issue corrections.  He also skipped grading our final exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: CSC321<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Can not express ideas clearly.

I agree with comments below alot of what he tought(like SQL scripts)never saw a computer screen. I would copy his scripts and try them on his data base and they would not run&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the below comments.  His lectures are simple, but he never goes over the in class exercises at all, so if he doesn't help you in class you're SOL.  The midterm is a joke compared to the final.  Be prepared, some of the final questions come out of nowhere.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2007<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the below comments. He starts off easy then gets super hard. Half the kids in my class didn't take the next class, CSC242. I think they all decided to change their majors. His lectures are clear but his expectations aren't! His midterm was a joke compared to the final. Some kids actually failed the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Starts off fairly easy then gets progressively more difficult and more crammed by the end. Midterm wasn't too bad but the questions on the final seemed to come out of nowhere. Rethink this class if you plan on taking it for your science elective, as many of us did and then regret it. Plus the book was super expensive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2007<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was kinda hard like for introduction to programming. The lectures and homework are too simplistic for the amount of knowledge he requires for final exam. Most teachers I know helped in preparing for exams, by making more clear what to expect. This one just told to review everything from the beginning of quarter!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2007<br>Class Name: CSC241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kinda hard class for an introduction to programing. He is knowledgeable, however his lectures are way to simplistic for the amount of understanding he requires.  Picked up the pace waytoo much after midterm. I found the final relatively hard. I do not believe he is a bad teacher, but I don't think he is suited for this course. Invest lots of work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He likes the subject and knows it well. Gives lots of examples and wants you to learn it - he likes being asked questions.  Fair grader.  Homework is easy I thought.  Midterm was easy - he covered all the material in class - no surprises.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2006<br>Class Name: 491<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>None</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2005<br>Class Name: CSC200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simply a good teacher...no complaints.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2005<br>Class Name: CSC491<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't think this class was as hard as it could have been. He's very thorough and answers any question you have. Pretty flexible with due dates.  One complaint, some of the material was a bit too formal with proofs. Some basic, no bs examples would have been better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2005<br>Class Name: CSC491<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>teaches well</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very persistant in making sure you know the information and won't move on until everyone gets it.  This is great until the last 2 weeks of class when he has to cram everything in (and it was harder material).  Pretty easy class overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: INTRODATABASE<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class...
