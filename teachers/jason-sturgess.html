Incredibly difficult class, but you won't learn more anywhere else.  He's an incredibly tough grader, which pushes you to give each case your best.    If you want to put in a regular amount of work and get an A, don't take this class.  If you want to work hard and learn a lot, sign up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2014<br>Class Name: FIN380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I've yet to take at DePaul, doesn't give you any direction on cases nor does he teach anything about the cases until AFTER they've been turned in, just assumes you should have already learned everything before. Also is a ridiculously tough grader, he'll say you did a good job on a case and when you get it back with a score of 48....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2014<br>Class Name: FIN380H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is a survival. The Professor rips your paper and analysis apart, actually leaving students with depression. In the end, you will learn more than in any other classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2014<br>Class Name: FIN380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor but heads up this class is less learning more practice. Some will learn, some will walk out not knowing what they did. Professor is extremely helpful. Final was take home but quite difficult. Working in new groups every week is a hassle and pain. Take him if you want to work really hard and learn as opposed to simply passing. Cheers</div></div></div></body></html>
