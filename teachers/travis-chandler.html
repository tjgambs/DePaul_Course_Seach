I actually learned a lot from this class and I'm not even a photography major. Also it's nearly impossible to fail because he always gives opportunities to better your work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2015<br>Class Name: GAM228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Travis is the best professor I have had at DePaul no doubt. He is one of the most friendly teachers that I have had and he genuinely cares about his students. On top of that his classes were interesting. He makes sure that you understand the material and honestly you would have to make an effort to fail this class. DEFINITELY take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2015<br>Class Name: GAM228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor, assigns a group for all projects with a short paper every week. Took the class to fill a requirement and would recommend to take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: DC228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's literally THE BEST, only 5 group presentations that aren't really hard, no quizzes or homework at all, you just have to read one chapter weekly, about 10-15 short pages,  and do a group presentation on it.  Super fun class and I totally recommend it. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2014<br>Class Name: DC125501<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Chandler is a very nice guy and so helpful, response to emails very fast. we had online midterm and he was reviewing it with us two days before so everyone gets an A. the prof. has never embarrassed anyone even though some students take bad photos, he always gives comments on what's good in the image and never said that's a horrible one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2014<br>Class Name: GAM228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Great Class. Great Movies. You get to express your opinions and make sense of how things in cinema or video games make such a big impact on addressing a topic. Controversy talks, but never judged or graded on your own personal opinion. Open and free to talk and discuss things related to the topic. TOTALLY RECOMMEND TRAVIS for you. He is great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: DC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Chandler is a great teacher who is very enthusiastic. He has a good balance between interesting tangents and teaching the material. He hardly gives homework and is extremely willing to sit down with anyone to solve any problems they might have. I thoroughly enjoy having him as a teacher, I strongly recommend him.</div></div></div></body></html>
