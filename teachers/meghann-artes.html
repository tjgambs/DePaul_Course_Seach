Very nice professor. If there's one thing that's not good it would be that she doesn't give a critique on your assignment. If you don't want to receive criticism, then go straight for her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2011<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor, I can't recommend her enough. She works in the industry so she really knows what she's talking about, and she also just knows how to teach. One note: I had her for DC120, and I got an A without ever opening the book, so I recommend saving yourself $40 (though I did take the 3-week version of the class). Overall, I give her an A+.</div></div></div></body></html>
