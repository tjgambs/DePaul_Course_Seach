Although the class isn't easy if you ask a question he will definitely help!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2014<br>Class Name: CHE105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I must agree he does have better than average hair for a professor. He must take Biotin. If you'e not a science major, this class may be difficult. BUT he is always willing to help and explain anything you might not grasp. This class is a bit time consuming, so be prepared. But over all he is a nice & enthusiastic professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2014<br>Class Name: CHEM131LAB<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, he takes a little warming up to, but once you get to know him, he is seriously one of the more sincere Chemistry professors you'll ever meet. Truly cares about students, and wants to make sure you're actually grasping concepts which in lecture is insanely impossible to do with some of the professors on campus who truly don't care.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2014<br>Class Name: CHEM134<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

He wants you to learn and is very committed. He refers a lot to the textbook, and it is recommended. If you read before class and pay attention you will be more than fine. There are a few assignment, a few quizzes, midterm, final, and presentation. There is also all the lab stuff. Easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2013<br>Class Name: CHE105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has better than average hair for a chemistry professor. The man loves water and obscure metaphors. If that doesn't make you want to take his class, I don't know what else will.</div></div></div></body></html>
