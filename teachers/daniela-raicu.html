Her classes are not easy, but she will make sure that you know the material and underlying theories. Pay attention, take an interest in the subject, and study hard and you should do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2015<br>Class Name: IS567<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Raicu is one of the founders of Predictive Analytics at DePaul. She is very knowledgeable about the subject. Despite having lengthy lectures, they're interesting, beneficial & dense. If you're a PA student, I would highly recommend taking this course with/after taking CSC424 in order not to be confused. highly recommend taking course with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2015<br>Class Name: IS567<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst classes I've had in the MSPA program. But it's required. Get ready to be confused a lot. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: CSC567<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Daniela is a really good professor and passionate about her work. She emphasizes concepts and understanding of the material so make sure you understand why you are doing something instead of just regurgitating examples (which you shouldn't anyway). Learned so much this quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: CSC567<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Raicu is passionate about this subject, unfortunately, that passion does not mean she can teach effectively. The prepared materials don't reflect the material that seems to be important to be successful in the exam.  On top of that, the only exam, the final, is 40 % of the final grade. Be very prepared. It will make or break your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2013<br>Class Name: CSC367<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wasn't what I expected - this class is mainly statistics and learning the mathematical process of data mining. She was extremely passionate about the content, had lots of examples, very willing to work with students/extend hmwk, and did lab tutorials. Midterm and final are mainly theory based! Make sure you understand concepts, partial credit given</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2008<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Raicu is extremely helpful, passionate and knowlegable about her field. Fair grader, gives extra credit a lot. Doesn't take attendance. Your whole grade is based on your midterm, final and homework. No textbook. She gives students one-on-one attention during class and is very helpful. Boring lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2007<br>Class Name: CSC324<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very intelligent and knows her field well, but is not clear in teaching less leartn individuals. For her Data Analysis II class, she used powerpoints that were a bit confusing; I found nearly all my help in the textbook even though the book itself was one of the hardest I ever used. She's very friendly and willing to help though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2007<br>Class Name: CSC324<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is definitely knowledgeable, but that doesn't mean she is a good teacher. It's unfortunate, because her power points are hard to follow without her direction. Secondly, the text book is probably more useful than her direction, however she doesn't use it all. Basically, I ended up teaching myself the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2005<br>Class Name: CSC423<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Passionate and very good at her field, encouraging students to do research with her.  Excellent slides, fair homework assignments and exams.  One of the best teachers at DePaul.  You will learn a lot in her classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2005<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes you calculate formulas by hand(without using functions on caculator) homework takes days this way. If you understand what the formula does, I do not see why you have to do it by hand. For an INTRO class Excel needs to be used more than the Advanced SAS program.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NOT helpful at all. The tests cover material the text doesn't. Neither are her powerpoints any good. The class was a waste of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2004<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Handwriting on whiteboard is hard to read. Needs to improve on explaining requirements to complete SAS assignments. Lecture is VERY organized. Makes time to help students. The book for the course needs to be replaced or revised.</div></div></div></body></html>
