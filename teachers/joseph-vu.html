He is extremely clear with his expectations and is very practical in his lectures. He has a great knowledge of his topics and really wants students to learn practical things for the real world. He will not waste your time but you must attend class and be serious. Take notes as tests are based off lectures and hw.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2014<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Average lecturer but course is well structured such that you will learn a lot.  You must do the readings,  put in the work, and pay attn. to lectures.     A high effort course but with plenty of learning in return.        </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2014<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Joseph Vu was a really great professor. He has a gift for teaching. I don't have any interest in Finance yet I understood all of the content because his style of teaching is wonderful. You must do the reading and the homework. Do not fall behind and you will do great on the midterm and final. I highly recommend taking this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2014<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked Prof Vu's teaching style and energy. He brings a wealth of knowledge (did his dissertation under Eugene Fama at U of Chicago)and lots of energy into the classroom. The class itself is more of a stock picking class, rather than a quant. analysis class. It really just touches the surface of port mgmt. I highly recommend Joe Vu.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/08/2013<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What an asset to Depaul Finance Dept! Breaks down the material to the basics and takes great care on challenging parts. Good sense of humor makes the classes fly by fast. Write everything down that he says and you'll do great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2012<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Vu knows his stuff very well and you'll learn a lot from this class.  He allows you to bring in a 'formula sheet' for exams, which are very reflective of homework questions.  Lots of real world experience and a great finance teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2012<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take online class, it is as close to an independent study as you can get. 100 questions online for midterm and final designed solely by the textbook makers. Online lectures consist of the prof summarizing the text chapters. No curve, plus you have to beware of mistakes on the midterm and final and notify prof of them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2012<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take the online class. 100 multiple choices for both midterm and final. At least 2/3 of them needs calculation. Even though I got a A-, average grade is B- and C.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2011<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Prof. Vu and the online version of this class.  He was terrible.  The averages on the midterm and final were 72 and 69 respectively and he did not curve the grades very much if at all.  I would take a different professor and the non online version of this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Vu was difficult for an online class.  The midterm was brutal but the final was not so bad and Vu did grade on a curve.  I know many say he is great in class but as far as online goes, I would avoid it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2010<br>Class Name: FIN330H<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Vu is a very nice guy and he knows his stuff. He can be hard to understand. His tests are based off of the homework problems that he hardly goes over. 15 mins devoted to hw and over an hour on theories. Know how to do the hw! Make sure to take good notes on his stories. Overall, not an easy class. Lots of work but its very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Here's the deal with the online class: It's useless to watch the lectures b/c he just reads the notes. Midterm is 40%, online, and is straight out of book & hard. Rest of the class, including the Final(also 40%), is an easy A. Read the textbook thoroughly, it has all the material for the final and is very useful for all aspects of your career.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2010<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is difficult, but Vu is the best you'll find.  90% of grade is a midtern and final, which are difficult, but he will curve a little. Cares about his students learning and is very accessible.  If  you have to take finance, I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2010<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to learn about how to evaluate companies and know a good stock then this is your class. The prof knows this topic very well. Has tons of experience and cares a lot about his students. I highly recommend this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2009<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Vu's lectures are interesting.  He does a good job of explaining concepts.  Weekly homework problems are not graded.  Midterm and final are difficult, and vary significantly from assigned problems.  Newly introduced case studies are very difficult and timeconsuming.  Guidance for these is minimal.  Very respectful cares about your progress.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took online course.  Very unhelpful.  Not clear at all on what he expects for the stock market project.  Provided no feedback.  I was very interested in this subject, but I think that because of the course format and professor, I didn't take away all that I wanted.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2009<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor with wealth of knowledge in Finance. He creates interest in the topic. As many mentioned there are two exams each carry 50% weight, but they are not really tough if you refer to the materials and the problems that professor covers in the class. I would highly recommend this professor. By the way his favorite class is FIN 563.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm wasn't bad, but the final was awful.  2 exams are worth 90% of grade so the final hurt alot of people.  You get a cheat sheet for formulas.  Homework similar to exam for most part, but adds difficult problems too.  Adds humor to lecture & talks alot about investments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Vu made it a great learning experience for the students with or without finance background. It's not an easy class( Take a lot of efforts to get more than B+), but you will definitely feel easier than it is by taking Prof Vu's class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2008<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor.  Very passionate about the market and will go to any lengths to make his students feel the same way.  Learned a ton from him and exams were fair. Definitely reccommend!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is probably the best professor I have had at DePaul so far. He knows his stuff and makes class interesting. You learn a lot from him. Exams are little tricky however not hard. Finance major should definitely take him. He has been teaching this class for 19 years and you can tell he knows his stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easily the best finance teacher at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One midterm (45%) , One final (45%) and 10% class participation counts towards grade. Homework problems are thoroughly discussed before each class and however of no use in mid-term or finals. Unless you are finance major and know finance concepts this class is of less value. A very useful tips in personal investing is what i learned.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expecting to hate the class, he kept class time enjoyable and interesting.  Didn't feel like his test prep was very clear and he didn't always follow the formula of what he explained would be covered.  Since grades are almost exclusively based on the midterm and final, that was tough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, decent professor, enjoys teaching. Follows book extensively. Spends significant time reviewing homework but tends to gloss over new material. Review material not necessarily on exams. Did not get as much out of the class as I had anticipated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's not the easiest class out there, but if you're looking for a finance professor that keeps you interested, and takes teaching seriously, this is the guy to take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2007<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Vu is awesome.  He is enthusiastic and extremely knowledgable.  Take him if you have the opportunity.  He would be great for FIN 523 because he loves investments so much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2007<br>Class Name: FIN330H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely the best professor I've ever had.  His enthusiasm for the subject makes his class so much more fun. He doesn't only want to teach you the subject,but wants to make sure you'll be able to apply it in the real world. The stock market project was very interesting and I learned a lot. Does a pretty thorough review for exams and a fair grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2007<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy! Lot's of experience! Funny especially his accent makes him even funnier. His experience is really what makes the class. Very helpful and really cares about the students. Not a professor that lectures straight through, but instead gives you the big picture and then helps digest the parts. Loved him and learned a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice Guy, Very Smart, funny too, unfortunately what he tells you to study for his exams is not what you'll see on exam day...I probably wouldn't take him unless you had to..not to mention 90% of your grade is midterm/final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: HONFIN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very strong asset to the finance department.  One of the best professors I have had at DePaul.  Not for those who just want to pass; take him if you want to challenge yourself.  Difficult understanding him at first but its endearing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/15/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330H<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I expected a lot more from this class. I felt like Vu watered the curriculum just a little bit. Vu is great, his grading scheme is mediocre- you always kinda know where you stand in the class. My one complaint: change your book! The required text is perhaps to most useless piece garbage I have had the unpleasant experience of reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2005<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I suggest avoid this prof. He's smart, knowledable, experienced, and interesting. The problem I had was with his exams, which were 50% qualitative and 50% quantitative.  The qualitative portion was straight forward, but the quantitative portion was not at all.  I would not recommend this professor at the graduate level, I don't think he's worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2005<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just wanted to add that he is *relatively* quick to respond to student's questions via the email. This is a quality that i find to be rare among DePaul staff. Same holds even after you are done with his class. For the record, i got C from him, but learned more then in classes where i have gotten A's</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2004<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i liked him. He made a lot of sence, was clear about the subject and related material to real world all the time. I belive that for investments class he is one of the best profs out there in DePaul. Exams are not easy but fair. partial credit is given</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2004<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are redundant and kinda drab, but he is still obviously a very smart professor who knows his stuff.  He follows the book pretty closely, so I find it okay to miss a couple of classes.  His lectures are very applicable to the real-world.</div></div></div></body></html>
