Gave daily warm ups (quizzes) where the answers to his questions were somewhat ambiguous.  The first hour of every class felt like a waste of time with overviews of the previous week :(  Liked the course material a lot but sadly his class left much to be desired. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2014<br>Class Name: HCI450<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Every quiz and test you take in his class will be a plethora of ambiguous "select all that apply" questions that almost always require some kind of context that he won't give you.  Many of these questions are absurd and irrelevant, in my opinion.  He does know his stuff, though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2014<br>Class Name: CSC578<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>He does not know how to teach at all. I took this class because I wanted to learn the concepts taught in the class, and I ended up learning nothing from the class. Did not find him helpful at all. There is not much guidance, this class is basically about self-learning, which I am not good at, so had a very tough time in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2014<br>Class Name: CSC578<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not sure if it's he didn't have enough knowledge on this topic or he's really bad at explaining, but he wasn't able to explain any concept and I'm not even kidding. Whenever I asked specific questions like when to apply certain algorithm or function, he usually answered 'read book or Matlab documentation again'. A lot of work but no learning  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2014<br>Class Name: HCI520<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class solely based on the subject matter. I had taken a class from this instructor before and hated every minute of it, but he set a new low for this course. Whenever someone would ask a question in Discussions, he would be very condescending in his reply and usually ask them to do something to justify their question or theory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2013<br>Class Name: HCI520<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He made use take quizzes to ensure we read the book and then read from the book in class.  When the attendance for the class went down his questions for the quizzes got harder and he started doing things to make the class difficult.  By far one of my worst teachers and classroom experiences.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2011<br>Class Name: HON207<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took a Honors CogSci: Cognitive modeling with him. Dry subject, but he understands that you're not a cogsci major.  His grading is easy and the projects are generally straightforward.  A lot of reading, but not too much compared to other honors classes.  I recommend him over other profs i've heard about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: GAM000<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really did not enjoy taking his class.  Was really boring to listen to and acted as if he was wasting his time being in class like he had something better to do.  Try avoiding him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures while you sit at the computer. gives you an activity for the day. answers every question if you dont know what to do (for the activitys and tests). super easy, pretty nice guy too.</div></div></div></body></html>
