The movies that he showed were not the most interesting but Prof. Mitchell is one funny dude, he knows his stuff. You'll actually learn in this class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2015<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can't get away with not doing your work, but if you do what he assigns (which is very reasonable) you will do fine. Just pay attention when he teaches things and then you have a lot of class time to work on projects. If you miss class he won't care but you'll need to finish your project on your own time. He's great, would take again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is awesome.

Papers and Projects that aren't bad and he gives you A's if you do them without just throwing it together. Watched good movies and actually explained things and related them to movies.

His class is really easy and he will always help you when you ask. He does not judge you and has no problem repeating himself. You do not have tests or quizzes just a final. Do take notes cause it will be on the final. You basically edit videos which is really fun and choose a movie  and write a paper on it. easy grader. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome professor and the class is really lay back, is just 3 written homework (analyze a movie of your choice)  and 3 project, plus a final that is extremely easy if you pay attention in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>This class is VERY EASY & FUN! Mike is very cool. He gives out 3 written homework and 3 film editing project. I've had experience before but even if you don't know, he goes over everything. Majority of the time, we're watching film. I loved it cause it was so laid back and I can do other homework. If you want an A or B, take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: DC105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mike was awesome! I enjoyed the class a lot, especially in class discussions. He really kept my interest for the subject and I learned a lot. Don't get a book because he goes over everything in class. Just study the review guides he gives you and you will be fine for the midterm and final. Midterm paper is pointless though, have fun writing it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: DC215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mike is awesome.  I had no experience with ProTools or anything Digital Cinema-related before taking this class and still managed to breeze through it.  You learn how to create sound design for film and analyze the sound in movies like Apocalypse Now.  Great professor. Take him if you ever get a chance!</div></div></div></body></html>
