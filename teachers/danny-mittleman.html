No help from him no matter how many time you ask, no clear answer. We did not get a single grade until week 9. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2014<br>Class Name: HCI406<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was incredibly interested in the subject matter being taught and had done a great deal of studying on my own time.  I still couldn't follow his lectures.  On top of that, he's an incredibly rude person who suspects deviance from hard-working students.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: PM440<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Too many assignments. Too many group projects. No feedback. Do not take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2014<br>Class Name: HCI406<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible at teaching new students! Unprepared. Terrible notes. Uncomfortable to talk to. I was so frustrated the ENTIRE length of class. I'm 1 project away (the project was assigned after the final even though we had no projects/homework for 3 weeks before the final) from being done and I can't wait.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this class if you want to spend (literally) hours doing his assignments. Overall, this course wasn't too difficult but take your time to read the materials/readings. The final wasn't bad, and he curves the grade too! He takes FOREVER to post grades on d2L, and he seems to be very busy but he makes an effort to assist students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2013<br>Class Name: HCI406<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mittleman throws down some difficult assignments with sometimes vague requirements, but they are not unlike what you would experience working in the field with difficult clients and projects.  He goes head-over-heels to explain things to his students when they ask, but his initial presentation of material is limited.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2013<br>Class Name: PM440<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very tardy grading memos. Course is very soft. Not much substance to the class. He is clearly more interested in research and is not a good teacher. He tries to make a soft social science course on online meeting facilitation into something meaningful but fails miserably.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2013<br>Class Name: CSC223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class online, first time ever. The professor was super great. Very clear with assignments. Weekly 10 questions quizzes. 1 Research paper. Was a very easy class, but learned alot. Very organized. Professor made it a smooth transition for those who have never taken a online class. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2010<br>Class Name: PM440<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is obviously interested in the subject but may be better in research. No feedback provided on grades until after class ended. Will respond quickly to questions but focuses too much on technologies available.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: IT201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>engaging lectures, very knowledgable about current IT issues.  Had us post to blog, create our own social networking site.  Good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER, there is not much else i can say, he does not know how to teach to new students that do not have any prior experience with web design he expects you to know and learn everything yourself not helpfull at all, he is an impossible grader, the final exam specifically said that he does not expect everyone to pass, stay AWAY</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: IT215<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIM! He doesn't grade his own hw, he has someone else do it and that person sucks at it! His lectures are incredibly boring. He doesn't explain the concepts very well either, it is hard to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2008<br>Class Name: IT201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class online and struggled to stay awake watching the lectures. The homework questions are not usually answered in the book, you have to research them online. It takes him at least 2 weeks to grade the hw of only 5 questions. The final is pretty easy if you use the study guide. He also tends to talk about random things & its annoying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: IT215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Danny is such good prof. his classes are fun and he keeps everybody involved either by asking or group work. I highly recommend him and I wish that he teaches a class like Java then I would definitely take the class with him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: IT215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I complained the whole time about how difficult the class was and how harsh the grading was but in the end I got a lot out of the class. Lectures were lively and interesting as was the material itself. I would recommend this prof to other students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: CSC223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class, relevant topics, easy to follow, knows alot about a whole bunch of stuff..  fun class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: IS511<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a waste of money, and the course lacked clarity and direction.  He even said so in class, the structure is very questionable for a gradute level course, I do not recommend him as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2005<br>Class Name: CSC426<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher, brought in several guest speakers to provide additional insight.  Great discussions in class, definitely take this class if you want to get the scoop on graduate school</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2005<br>Class Name: CSC223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher with a broad range of knowledge that he relates to make a very interesting class. it was the only class that term that i never ditched.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2005<br>Class Name: CSC223<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very easy class.  requests that you buy the book and assigns readings but does not test.  only 3 three part papers due all quarter.  easy class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: IS511IS512<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this professor for both classes. Both of these classes invoked a lot of thought and we had some great discussions. If you are a policy person and enjoy good structured debates (he's a stickler for time) this is a great class for you to take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: IS372<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher but assumes you know excel like an expert. Refuses to have an advanced excel lab. Dont take this guy and this course unless you are a master of excel because he uses it for everything and will not help you.  Otherwise he is OK.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2004<br>Class Name: ECT250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher, def will learn useful information outside the computer department. He has important segments, that the CTI school currently lacks.

He curved the midterm and the final and requested that everyone who scored less than a 70 on the midterm personally meet with him to discuss how they could do better on the final.  Good guy...take him</div></div></div></body></html>
