    I slept every day and pulled an A.He tends to ramble alot merely because he is trying to engage the class into discussion.Many students had no interest in the material due to its seemingly vapid topic; however, the EU has a lot and will have a more pertinence to our generation's future. Nice guy too

    Dr. Dufour is a very passionate, interesting professor. He ties the material we study to a lot of what's happening currently around the world. I'd really recommend him. Also, while he does let his more liberal (social democrat) bias be known, he is objective and willing to listen to other opinions.

    If you're interested in the subject, you will LOVE the class. His lectures were very interesting and it made everyonw want to participate and ask questions and make comments. He is so knowledgable and wise. Wonderful teacher. No nonsense kind of guy, so do your work, and you will love it.

    He definitely knows his material and although class can get a little boring, it's extremely informational. his tests and grading is much easier than he makes it seem theyll be. I got an A.. don't be intimidated. and he makes you laugh- not by being funny but hes just a little weird. haha. good class

    Not a horrible teacher, but also not good!  it is not that hard to understand him w/ his accent, but the class is very boring, except sometimes laughing at him (AT not with him).  but he does love what he teaches and knows a lot, do the reading and you will be fine!

    he's an ok teacher he likes it when every speaks or talks in the class, but hard to understand.  If you can write good bull*#@* you can pass the class.  Most of the tests are writing essay and some multiple choice.

    This guy is such an awesome professor, as he makes the class worthwhile. His lectures are very interesting and the professor knows a lot about what he teaches. In fact, he can go on for hours without the need to stop talking. Take him if you want to learn

    Took him for Western European Politics, and yeah, he is hard to understand.  All he wants is for you to learn a few facts, who's who, different system and then &quot;regurgitate&quot; them on a test.  He is a very poor teacher

    I took Prof. Dufor my 1st year at DePaul, he is a nice guy, but it is so difficult to understand his notes. Before you know it there are arrows all over the board connecting words to words, making it difficult to keep your notes organized. exams are hard.

    I had him for a Focal Point seminar. He was a nice guy but didn't allow for class discussion and student participation, which was a big portion of our grade. I learned a lot from his class, but I will never take him as a teacher again (if I can help it).

    Is a little difficult grading presentations. Passionate about what he teaches. Warning: French Canadian accent.
