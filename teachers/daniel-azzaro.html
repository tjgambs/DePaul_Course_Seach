    This is a tough one man. I really hear nothing but good things about this guy. Took him last semester and I had mixed feelings. The guy seems super nice and cool, but I wish class was a little more serious. Never thought I'd say that. But I just couldn't handle the constant joking with past students. Frustrating at times, but overall, class was ok.

    Awful. He might be better in his element (prad classes) but this course that he came up with was such a stitched-together weak excuse for a course.

    One of the best professors I've ever had. Hands down. Every lecture was interesting and engaging. He is incredibly funny and genuinely cares about his students. A real college professor. Doesn't care about attendance, but rather that you grasp the material. He gives minimal work and understands that students have lives! TAKE HIS CLASS!!

    Incredible professor and has 30+ years of experience in the advertising and marketing business so he is very knowledgable. I highly recommend him.

    I've never had a class with him; I graduated a year ago from DePaul and live with two girls who still attend there. With that said, ALL I HEAR ABOUT IS DAN AZZARO so he must be doing something right.

    Azzaro is cool with me. He's really corny and his handwriting is illegible. But he's super smart and knows everything about the advertising world. He's an average grader.
