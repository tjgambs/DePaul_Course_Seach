Professor Rooney is by far the nicest professor I've ever had but more importantly she seems to love teaching. It was nice to have a professor who enjoyed being in class. She encouraged me as a writer which is something I have struggled with. A truly wonderful class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor!

She gives great feedback on your writing and will do her best to help you improve. Do the few readings you're assigned, be open to writing poems and trying to improve, and go to class and you'll have no issue. Would definitely recommend her and would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>such a great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2013<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a joy it is to take a class with Dr. Rooney. I have a massive crush on her brain. You'll learn a lot in her class, and you'll have fun doing it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: ENG219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most helpful professors I have ever had. She is very involved in the poetry community and brings a lot of that experience to class. She did an amazing job setting up the course and teaching it. I can honestly say I learned a lot. Fun, friendly, nothing not to like. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2013<br>Class Name: ENG309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken Prof Rooney for three quarters. She is by far the best professor I have ever had. Honestly, grades are meaningless in her class, and you learn so much more than the simple desire of a grade. I wish more teachers were like her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2012<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really nice. She's fun and quirky in class and keeps it relaxed while still pushing on learning and getting stuff out of the material. Besides a bunch of reading and 4ish papers, she teaches differently than most other profs i've had and tries to be different -- which works well for her. Take her if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2012<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Rooney is amazing!

So creative and talented, and she is without a doubt my favorite teacher at DePaul. Inspired me to get deeper into poetry. She's a great author and she's actually been published many times. If you're into writing, she's the best teacher you can possibly have.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2011<br>Class Name: A240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rooney is witty, intelligent, and eloquent. But she is understatedly defensive and even more subtly resentful if you oppose her views. Be warned: if you find yourself at the wrong end of her favor, your grades might not suffer but your confidence might, as she marks up your papers with brash criticism thinly veiled as academic critique.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2011<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher! She has a passion for what she does and makes sure everyone understands the context. Easy A if you pay attention and do the readings, fun group activity at the end of the quarter. Her grading properly reflects analyzing poetry and I learned a lot from her. Real pretty too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2011<br>Class Name: ENG272<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Rooney is my favorite professor at DePaul.

Rooney is perfection wrapped in a gorgeous women.  If you don't take a class with her you're a fool. A staple of modern Chicago poetry and one of the best instructors I've ever had.

She's very passionate about poetry and teaching. She makes a few tangents during class, but it's all very engaging. Class atmosphere is comfortable. We all have a lot of fun, and she's very open to interpretation and student opinions. Really easy to talk to and an all around great prof. I highly recommend her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rooney is amazing, I highly recommend any class that she teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful.
