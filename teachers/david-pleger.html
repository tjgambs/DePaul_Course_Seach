Unlike many other classes at DePaul I actually cared about what Professor Pleger was saying.  His expectations are clear and I feel like I learned more than in most other DePaul classes.  My only criticism is that this course was a little too easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2012<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. Assigned a chapter to groups of three, every day there is one presentation. He is not strict at all, it's actually kind of fun.  There are two tests, he basically gives you the answers weeks before.  Super easy plus I'm actually learning something. He doesn't teach at depaul often so if you find him take him!</div></div></div></body></html>
