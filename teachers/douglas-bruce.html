    Professor Bruce is a nice man. Epidemiology is not easy and can get confusing... You will be fine if you take your time on the online lectures, take notes, more notes, and be up to the class schedule when meeting in class. Don't fall behind in the readings or your toast.

    Quizzes due weekly, midterm, final, and a presentation - that's it. Thursday we met in class for lecture and online quizzes were weekly. They are pretty straightforward and exams are easy as long as you study the key concepts of each module he posts on D2L.

    I thought the class would be easy. The hardest part is keeping up with the readings and the term paper due at the end of the quarter. Its a good class, anyone in the minor should take it.
