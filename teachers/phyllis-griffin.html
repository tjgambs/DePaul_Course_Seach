All you had to do was show up lay on a mat and listen to her voice while she instructed you. Writings were based solely on reflection. it was an easy A two credit class and was absolutely worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: VOICE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind, open and generous spirit. Phyllis encouraged students to "find their voice". She respects their process and allows for exploration without playing mind games, or speak condescendingly her students like other teachers or"professors" of this school  would.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2013<br>Class Name: PAX250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is really good. Everyone in my class loved her and the things you learn are extremely interesting. You basically go to class all day and lay on mats while she takes you through lessons. I would not recommend this class if you miss class a lot though, as attendance is 70% of your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: VOICESPE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely LOVE this woman!!! She put's her heart and soul into her lesson. I learned so much in her class. My favorite work hands down was the Lessac. In this class I discovered my Artistic Voice something that I will always keep near and dear to my heart.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2009<br>Class Name: VAS102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The quarter started off promising, but then it became apparent that she basically had no idea what she was doing. She was disorganized and would arrive late; I feel like a wasted this quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2005<br>Class Name: VOICE<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a pretentious windbag who cares more about campus diversity issues than the course material.  Not challenging at all.  Her inability to articulate the material she &quot;teaches&quot; borders on negligence and/or incompetence.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2005<br>Class Name: VOICEANDSPEEC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher EVER.

Her directing abilities are questionable at best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: VOICESPEECH101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a goddess. depending on how much of a leftist, rebel, hippie, zen, angry, sad, understanding, etc you are, you will either love her or hate her. She will help reorganize your body so that you can optimize your performance as an actor. read Moshe Feldenkrais, Arthur Lessac, Kristin Linklater, alexander technique before attending class in Fall</div></div></div></body></html>
