You HAVE to work for your grade; no slacking. Going to his office hours helps a lot, but try to go with specific questions. If you put in the effort you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2015<br>Class Name: MIS360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. G is one of those professors whom you'll absolutely hate if you are a lazy student and absolutely love if you are not. His classes are the hardest at DePaul but are the only classes I have thoroughly enjoyed. Study hard, go see him whenever you can, and get ready to actually learn stuff. Oh also don't take both his classes in the same quarter!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2015<br>Class Name: MIS370<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Grant is the reason I changed  from my MIS major. He is the only professor that teaches not one, but two required MIS courses at DePaul... and he is NOT an easy grader. Prepare for him to ruin your GPA. He thinks his class is the most important thing you're taking, you're going to spend all Saturday studying, and the textbook is holy. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2014<br>Class Name: MIS360<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>So Dr. Grant is a tough grader, has tough tests, and a few tough HW assignments. Definitely not something I would choose to take if given a choice, however I can honestly say I worked hard for my grade. You have to read the chapters and attend all lectures. He gives you a bunch of practice on diagrams and doesn't just give away answers. Work hard!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2014<br>Class Name: MIS674<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good for learning about systems analysis and design. Not good for someone wanting an A grade.  That's because the grading is subjective, the assignments are high risk because no feedback until you've turned in the homework and many exam questions worded in a trick way. Dr. G seems to care about the subject and making students work very hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: MIS360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a Mid-Term, final, final project and couple hws. He is clear on what he wants "keep it simple and stupid" and you get A. You will need to work for it though. Many if not all students find him hard but he actually cares about what you learn in class. He pulls jokes during class and try not to skip class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2014<br>Class Name: MIS360<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>This course is not that hard but he will try to make it seem that way so you will become the most obedient working class blue collar worker when you get out into the real world. This class is not about discipline and hard work but more about building tolerance for unfair grading and obedience. STAY FAR AWAY but you can't if you could everyone would</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2014<br>Class Name: MIS360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. G is an awesome professor!! He is tough but fair. The class is very enjoyable. Make sure to read the chapter. READ the syllabus, and make sure to turn in the correct hw. His class forces you to have a good work ethic but, at the end of the day, you'll be a better student for it.  One of the best professors I've taken at my 4 yrs at Depaul. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2014<br>Class Name: MIS360<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. G is an awesome professor! He truly prepares you for the workplace. He makes you work for everything in his classes, which scares some students. I was extremely satisfied with what I learned in his classes; it is safe to say that I've learned more in his classes than the entire academic year at DePaul. Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2014<br>Class Name: MIS370<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As already stated, guy has zero interest in his students' success. Teaches at a ugrad level and is shocked when the class is confused. Part of grade includes clicker questions, which are based off of material learned 2 minutes previously and points are awarded only if you get question right. Grant is just plain awful. Avoid at all costs</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2013<br>Class Name: MIS360<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. G is a very tough professor. He does know what he is talking about however you do need to read everything he tells you to that being said you also need to understand it. I would recommend getting a couple people to study with. I would only recommend taking two additional classes it requires ALOT of study time!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2013<br>Class Name: MIS674<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. G was the worst professor I have had at Depaul. His teaching style is to tell you to just read the book when you have a question. I dreaded going to this class every week but it was gratifying to finish it. Good luck...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2013<br>Class Name: MIS360<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. G is that “one” teacher everyone hates. He is required for MIS major.Sorry but expect the worst experience of your college career. I got a B, but I understood some of this before the class. Find the Quiz guide(find online) for midterm & Final. If DePaul finally gives you another option TAKE IT, don’t take him at all! God have mercy on you.....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2012<br>Class Name: MIS370<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're an MIS or E-Commerce major, you must go through Dr. G. He's vague when describing assignments. He only reinforces concepts that you have to study; he doesnt teach them. He refers you to the book if you have a question. You MUST read EVERYTHING he tells you too. That being said, Im I had him as a professor. Passing his class is gratifying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2011<br>Class Name: MIS370<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Why did i take this class&#63; I had no choice. He is so vague about what he wants from us, which gets everyone confused. He insists that the trouble we go through is an integral part of our learning experience. &quot;No pain, no gain&quot; More like: No teach, no learn. READ, STUDY, READ. I would've prob learned more by reading through his lecture. NO BUENO</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2011<br>Class Name: MIS674<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He must be the overflow teacher for the graduate level. His lectures, examples and most test questions are straight out of the book, which must be read completely, really dull reading. He brings no creativity or real life examples to his lectures.  Pay attention in class, read the entire book, take notes as you read and you'll do fine on the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2011<br>Class Name: MIS674<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable and a fair grader. Sometimes the assignments can be unclear, but if you point out what was unclear, he will understand and may even give you credit. Likes things done his way,good practice for dealing with bosses for those w/o work experience. A UML on Visio manual would be a good suppl. ref. Learned a lot, be prepared to work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2010<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely outrageous instructor. Incompetent in all possible aspects. Teaching consists of reading from a powerpoint. His assignment directions are incomprehensible, careless, error-filled, hastily made nonsense. Disgraceful is probably the best word to describe his overall philosophy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2009<br>Class Name: MIS360<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor in the history of DePaul University.  I can not believe I received such a grade when I worked off my butt.  He does NOT know how to teach.  Unfortunately, if you are a MIS major, you have to take him for this and MIS 370.  He only teaches night classes, plus, he does a weird &quot;macarena&quot; dance which is totally weird.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: MIS360<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is by far the worst proessor I have ever taken at DePaul. He will not help you if you go to him for help. He will tell you to read the book. He goes back on his word. He can not even give real life examples when asked. I changed my major because of him. Makes racial comments in class to students, and he is black himself...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2009<br>Class Name: MIS674<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just took a midterm supposed to be on chapters 1 thru 8.  It was on chapters 1 thru 9.  40% of the midterm was based upon homework that was not graded or handed back to us.  This is a complete waste of money.  I took this class to learn something, and all I have learned is that he does not care about teaching or you actually learning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2008<br>Class Name: MISMIS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh my god. There are professors who really know how to teach and who really know how to handle the students by giving some hard time. But this professor was USELESS. He thinks he is smart, he thinks he is hot, he thinks he is very knowledgable professor. BUT HE's NOT. I could've learned a lot if I just read the book instead of sitting in that class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2008<br>Class Name: MIS674<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A incredible waste of time and money; not sure I can say much more. The guy is arrogant, believes he is brilliant, conducts class right from the book but contridicts it constantly, and like was mentioned is extremely subjective.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2008<br>Class Name: MIS674<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you ant the honest truth here it is: This guy is terrible professor; take the advice or not but, these words will come back to haunt you if you avoid them &quot;I told you so!&quot; I only wish there was another professor available but I needed the class. I have trusted this site and given unbiased opinions my entire Graduate term; Lesson 1 don't take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: MIS370<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Believe me in saying that Professor Grant's class is hard as nails.  Don't expect an easy grade at all if you're looking for something easy.   If you're willing to do the work (seriously, 6-8 hours a week) and pay attention in class, you will get a LOT out of this class.  He will make you think and work for your grade, but you'll be better for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2008<br>Class Name: MIS370<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>zzzzzzzzzz</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: MIS370<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>!!!!The WORST Professor!!!!!  The only person who could get an A in his class is himself. He grades based on what he would do not what is asked or what is right. He criticizes students when they are having trouble or ask questions.  Trust me, I am a full life cycle software developer and do this stuff for a living. Until this class I had a 4.0 GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2008<br>Class Name: MIS370<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, this guy is exactly what everbody's been saying on this site.This man is on a ego trip every class.Just because you yell and scream unintelligible sounds do not mean you are passionate.  Likes to confuse students thinking that it is for their own good and it will help in the real world, while you end up with a c- with no explanation of why.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2008<br>Class Name: MIS370<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. G is the bomb diggity.  If you don't like to work or learn, then don't bother taking this class.  Dr. Grant challenges you to apply concepts to real world excercises.  He's incredibly fun and keeps things loose while getting a lot of work done.  People who complain about Dr. Grant are lazy and unmotivated, and probably shouldn't be in college.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2008<br>Class Name: MIS370<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Grant is a terrific professor who knows his stuff. In my opinion, this class is not for people who do not like challenges. Those who complain are not mature enough to for this class. The homework can become a handful but just read the book carefully.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: MIS360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked this class.  All assignments and subjects discussed are relevent now! Take note on his way of design... it will make sense later when you apply it. Read the text carefully and discuss. Our class found discrepancies with the text and Dr Grant's preference. Get clarification early because there is only one test given. Good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: MIS370<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Slackers Beware! Dr Grant's class prepares you for the REAL WORLD. He gives no answers, just direction... just like you would get from your boss or peers at work, thus you have to draw on your analytical skills. His class was interesting and challenging.  He uses the text and is very helpful when you ask for it! Very honest in remarks, nice smile.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2007<br>Class Name: MIS370<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's unclear what he wants for the homework and project.  He expects too much from students and doesn't let the students know his expectations.  Unhelpful & hard grader. Instead of letting u know what is the right answer, he will give u clues.  Exam I & II don't just study what he lectures.  Read the book.  This class is disappointing & painful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2007<br>Class Name: MIS360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not as horrible as everyone makes him sound.

Okay, I must say that this clown does know his field, but his inability to teach, along with his 'higher-than-thou' sissy'tude makes his class unbearable.

He criticizes everything and anything especially on your homework. He is a VERY TOUGH grader!!! You think that you did a great job on your assignments. Guess again when he grades them he thinks that you didnt care about the assignment and that you a plain lazy when working on them. Avoid him if you can!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2007<br>Class Name: MIS360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't understand why there are so many negative comments here. This class was definitely not easy and required a LOT of work. But that doesnt mean Dr. Grant is a bad professor. He explains the material very well, and if you ask questions and show interest he will be glad to help you out. Just pay attention in class and read the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2007<br>Class Name: MIS674<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel really sorry for this guy.

Do not buy the book, because he puts everything you need to know on PP slides.  Quizes are fairly easy if you go over the PP slides.
