Has great insights and is extremely helpful and personable, especially to those willing to participate.  If you are a major and can get a class with him definitely do it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2012<br>Class Name: ANT105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am taking his class Anthropology through film, and we watch movies all the time. He is an awesome teacher! I agree that the fieldwork project is unusual for a 100 level class, but he is so interesting to listen to that I never fall asleep in his class. If you do the work and put in an effort, he is an easy grader. Take his class if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2012<br>Class Name: ANT101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not a bad teacher. But I'm doing 300 level coursework (a fieldwork project) in a 100 level class. He's a good guy but wasn't helpful in picking my field site. I'd take him again, but not if he's going to assign something unusual for a level 100 class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>People are not giving Kinsella enough credit. I had him for my Discover class, and he was great! Very passionate about the subject area, not a hard grader and keeps discussions interesting (if you actually participate). He was open to being emailed with questions, and overall very approachable. Would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2011<br>Class Name: ANT101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes he is an anthropologist, but I signed up for Cultural Anthropology, not Cultural Anthropology in Africa. Nor did I sign up for a class about art in Africa. That is all we really talk about. Apartheid, art, Africa, and his personal life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2011<br>Class Name: ANT101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>incredibly boring. talks about his trips abroad but not the course material. you must read the books over and over to eek material out. he does know what he is talking about but cant transmit it in a understandable way</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2007<br>Class Name: ANT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Dr. Kinsella's class. I think he would be better suited to teaching graduate level, but over all he knows his subject matter and alot of the kids in the class were not interested and were taking it for granted.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2006<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives a lot of busy work.  He expects a lot from a 100 level class.  He is easy though if you meet his requirments you should get an A for C level work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2006<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love learning about different cultures, but this man was extremely boring! He knows his stuff, but he's not very good at explaining it to someone else, let alone keeping them interested!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2006<br>Class Name: ANT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Kinsella knows his stuff...I suggest anyone interested in cultural anthro take his class.
