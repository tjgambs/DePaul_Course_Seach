She's super helpful, had her for 201 &319 and learned more than my other Italian classes combined, she's funny, blunt, and doesn't take any BS from anyone, including superiors. She's funny and interesting and understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2012<br>Class Name: ITA106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE DANIELA. Take her every chance I can. She's the best, most entertaining, most respectable, and clearest at explaining the material of all the Italian profs. She's so passionate about the culture and language. She's hilarious, blunt, but it's an act bc she's very kind hearted. Has her standards for students' work, so just DO IT bc its fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2010<br>Class Name: ITA106<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Daniela is a good teacher but I don't appreciate the fact that she does most of the talking.  If you try to engage in conversation class discussion she will cut you off write away if its wrong rather than hearing you out and then fixing your errors. I spoke less in class, only when I knew that everything I was going to say was correct.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2010<br>Class Name: ITA101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's definitely somewhat on the harsh side, but she's a great teacher. Not to mention she's hilarious.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2008<br>Class Name: ITA114<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hilarious but a bit harsh at times, take her. she's fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2007<br>Class Name: ITA100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor.

It is a shame that we only have her on T and TH and that the book sucks...which henders her teaching style. She has that laid-back European feel and will go over stuff with you if you need help. If you can have her take her. I would take Italian again next quarter if she was teaching it everyday. Thanks 4 laughs</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: ITAL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>frikin' hilarious..and a grwat teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: ITA<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i had her 3+ yrs ago and she remembered me! because of her i was able to retain so much of the language - enough to have a conversation with her - and i haven't spoken italian since i was her student! she's wonderful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: ITA111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an excellent Italian teacher.
