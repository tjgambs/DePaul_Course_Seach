You listen to guest speakers every class. You cannot miss more than 2 classes or else you fail. HW is type up 2 questions for the guest speaker. Very easy, and it's only 40 minutes. You get a lot of advice and wisdom from the guest speakers. I loved all the speakers!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: HSP350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Also took HSP 303 with her. She is awesome. Her lectures are dry, but she is very passionate about hospitality and she has so much experience. Deadlines are VERY IMPORTANT to her so make sure you do not turn anything in late. Attendance is part of participation. She is a good resource for the school of hospitality and job/intern hunting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: HSP352<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I also took shelley for HSP 350. I really like her as a teacher. She has a LOT of professional experience in the industry and I definitely have learned a lot from her. Her grading isn't hard but she does expect you to read and participate. She has a lot of trust in her students as for the final you actually put on an event that the school pays for.</div></div></div></body></html>
