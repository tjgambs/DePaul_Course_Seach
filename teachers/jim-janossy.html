Although it's entirely online, the class is tough and comes with lots of work including lots of reading and watching lectures he posts to Youtube.

If you have lots of time, you can take him, but I would not recommend him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2015<br>Class Name: GPH205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Janossy was awesome!! Tell me of another class where you could set your own schedule and are allowed to re-do quizzes and assignments until you reach 100%.. Yes there is a lot of reading involved but he did make the quarter easier for everyone by making one specific lecture for each unit.. I actually learned a lot from his class!! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: GPH205<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the worst class I have taken at DePaul. Most unorganized, hard, heavy load class I have ever taken. He requires the most ridiculous assignment and looks for every detail in each assignment. Big regret taking this class-huge waste of my time.  Be prepared for multiple emails a day from him. Save yourself the stress and do not take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2015<br>Class Name: GPH205<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am 34 through this course and have never taken a more disorganized or infuriating credit in my life.

He was never available to assist on what were truly some of the most difficult, convoluted, and poorly organized assignments I have ever attempted. His class website and book, literally his as developed them himself for this class, are riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes, unanswerable questions, ETC.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2015<br>Class Name: GPH205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This online class is so confusing and lots of work. He doesn't use D2L-uses his own website and book that isn't clear. His online quizzes are super hard even though you can retake them, I've never gotten 100%. Regret taking this class. You can take a better class with less work not online.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2015<br>Class Name: CSC200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Janossy is the man! This class is not a blow off and is pretty hard to get used to. However, he will give the best feedback to all your work and you will get to revise it for full credit. Take this course if you can but don't expect to just finish a weeks worth of work in one day. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2014<br>Class Name: CSC200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome online class to take. Just one book that's cheap and Janossy wrote it. You make your own deadlines and everything is repeatable until you get 100%. Loads of easy extra credit offered and Janossy gives super specific feedback. There is definitely a lot of work in the course, but it's not very hard and Janossy makes it very easy to get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: CSC200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You'll either love or hate him. uses a textbook that he wrote himself for CSC200 which I found to be wordy and convoluted most of the time, but it had a lot of good information. The work is easy once you've read everything carefully, and for an online class you can't complain about the workload. Overall he is of course nice but wordy beyond belief.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2014<br>Class Name: GPH205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't use D2L, instead has his own blog full of words yet nothing is helpful. Emails you all the time, at least 3-4 emails throughout the day. This online class is a disaster, I regret taking this. Sends you to a different website to take his "quizzes" that aren't really quizzes, just another workbook or exercise. So confusing. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: CSC200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Take him!

A LOT. And I got no where near the grade I expected (a lot worse). He told me I was fine util the last few days when he never responded.

The amount of work you will do is insane. Not to mention the workbook being inconsistent and leaving you to find information between pointless material he "likes", a great textbook, and videos that put you to sleep.

Save yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2013<br>Class Name: GPH205<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HIs online class is a lot of work.

Whenever I needed help he was always there to assist. Is very vocal thru emails and will let you know when stuff is coming up.

You use his poorly written, mistake filled workbook for guided exercises which take far more time and effort to complete than is necessary. There's 4 hours of lecture per week, 8 minutes of which is important. He lets you resubmit work and the online exercises are guess and check so missing an A is impossible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: GPH205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>.....*sigh*  Reallyyyy nice guy!One of the nicest I've had at DePaul.  But unfortunately the book he uses is one that he wrote which is SO confusing.  You have to take online quizzes which he says are not for a grade....but they are.

He is so helpful and really cares about what and how much you are learning.  He lets you take quizzes many times to get a high grade.  I honestly learned so much in this class.

This guy is amazing! Take him, you will not regret it! He was so understanding and open to new ideas, and I liked that his assignments weren't too hard.

The only complaint I have isn't his fault; I thought the class would go more into photography, but it's mainly architecture.  Really into what he teaches and gives good (if long) presentations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2005<br>Class Name: ECT250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Janossy is my favortie prof by far at DePaul.  I have had him as a prof 3 times and all three times he was excellent. I am honored to say he was the most motivating of all my profs and I now have a great job in the tech field thanks to his leadership. I would reccomend him to all who want to do something with there life. He is the best!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2004<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!  His midterm and final are straight from the notes, so study them.  Reading the book is pointless.  Also, if you're lucky, if you do better on the final than the midterm, he'll take the final exam score over the midterm score.  Definitely benefits the student.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: INTERN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, this guy is a real relic. He's out of touch, plays hilariously bad &quot;corporate team&quot; movies, and brought in a speaker who was such an 80s relic it was pathetic. He also assigned a 12 page paper on a topic we didnt even discuss in class. AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2004<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is super cool. He is sooo helpful, very leanient, and accepts late work with no penalty. He also took the time to show us exactly how to write a good research paper. Really helpful teacher who genuinley cares about his classes .</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: CSC210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY GOOD TEACHER!!!

The class and homework were pretty easy until the end of the quarter.  Very late with grading and getting back to you sometimes.</div></div></div></body></html>
