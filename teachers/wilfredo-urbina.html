Tests have the opportunity for lots of extra credit.  If you do the homework and study this class is not to bad.  Would reccomend him to take for calc</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is hard to understand and hard to follow along with. A lot of what I learned was through the online hw. He does however give out a lot of extra credit that will definitely boost your grade. I would not recommend but not the worst teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>has homework online and through the book. cannt understand him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2009<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Urbina is awesome. Theres really no way u can fail if u study and follow what he says in class. He literally gives 35 extra credit on each test and 45 on the final! even if u get some wrong, the extra credit makes up for it. Hes awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are willing to put in extra time outside of class to teach yourself or be tutored, then take him. I did poorly on my first exam and he let me retake it. He is very flexible with that kind of stuff. He does collect hw. His reviews are exactly like the miterm and final, and he lets you use a sheet of paper with anything you want.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2009<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher. I have never gotten lower than an A- in a math class and i got a B- in this class... DO NOT TAKE HIM! worst math teacher ever!!! If u want to get a good grade don't take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2009<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He uses My Math Lab which is amazing. Hes hard to understand and he writes his notes very tiny so sit up close to the front. I would take him again just because he assigned homework and his reviews were identical to the tests. I would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2009<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>URBINA IS MY BOY! He gives like 35 points extra credit on the first exam and I haven't taken the next two yet but they seem like they will be just as easy... He clearly lays out what he expects and if you do it half assed you can get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>urbinas is the most helpful prof ever. i hate math and failed both test and final. and had a horrible hw grade. he let me retake the 2nd test. and i ended up with a C- which i didnt deserve. if u ask him for help he is more than willing. he is definitely hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard to understand, so listen up! Attend classes and you will do fine! Exams are pretty easy, just make sure you do all the homework! Drops two of the lowest homework assignments, and when he says derivatives or limits..its quite entertaining he gets quite excited! take this class though!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although he is hard to understand (his accent), he is a good teacher, pay attention, do H, TAKE NOTES, and you will do well in his class, he lets you use a notecard on tests, and curves the test if people do bad, 2 midterms (not that hard) and a final are the only tests, i will definately take him for BMS 126!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I understand if the professor have an accent, but i still souldn't hear a word he is saying cause he don't know how to speak up. And since it was a big class, he mostly care about the people who sits in the front. You can't even tell if he is even talking to you or the wall. And what he writes on the board is hardly visible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>urbina is a great teacher! took him during night class, and compared to meeting once a week, he gives so little homework (10 problems from the book, 20 online) so you have all week to do them. two midterms (not too bad if you study) and cheat sheets help you out tons. his accent does make him hard to understand, but teacher who wants you to learn</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher. You wont understand a word he is saying. He makes too many  simple errors. I dont even think he is qualified to teach this subject. Oh and review guides are nothing like the actual test he gives out.  So get out of this class if you want to pass</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is so hard to understand.  Half the time I didnt even know what he was saying.  Everyone said the practice test are just like the actual tests but thats so not true.  His tests were so confusing and completely different from the practice test.  I wish i would have taken another teacher.  Do not take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I HATE MATH. But Urbina is not too bad. He gives written hwk from the book and online hwk (the online hwk is easy) and he lets you use a cheat sheet on the test! And he doesnt check! make a good note sheet and you should be able to pass atleast with a C!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to do well, invest in a tutor.  Only way you'll pass.  Or even get a good grade for that matter.  Lots of homework</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>get out of this class. I made the stupid mistake of taking this class. He doesnt give out review guides any more. His tests are hard as hell. Do not take him. I used to get A's in all my math classes but not this one</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate math but this class was easy. He grades homework, but  solves any HW problems in class if you have questions on them. Also gives a handout of what problems will be on tests/final. he only changes numbers for the actual tests. Great, very straight forward. If you keep up w/ homework it'll be an easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2009<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher. very hard to understand. He will kill you with boredom. lots of homework. online and written.. Both of them graded. you won't learn a thing in this class.. SO good luck if you take him..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher was very helpful and that his pre-test were exactly like the real ones didn't hurt.  So take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>take him!!! he's the best calc teacher out there. hes really hard to understand but its something you have to get used to. midterm, 1 quiz, and a final, attendance and hw is mandatory.. but if you go to the tutors.. theyll help out. the study guide is exactly the same thing as the tests.. obvs with the numbers changed. theres no way you cant pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was an awful professor and you should drop his class immediately if you are enrolled.  If you understand Calculus you can get by with a B- possibly but otherwise switch out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A-W-E-S-O-M-E --- This guy knows how to teach math! He is always in his office and willing to help you understand everything. TAKE THIS GUY! The best math teacher at DePaul (and DePaul doesn't have many good teachers at all!)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked his teaching style and enjoyed his class. Every test is just like the study guide and there was even a take home. He is very fair in his grading and he makes calc. understandable. I highly recomend taking him if you struggle in math.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2008<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His teaching is lackluster to say the least. Hard to understand, but his tests are very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2008<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay heres the basic point of the class. The Bad: He is hard to understand and his notes are pointless. He collects homework, and attendence is mandatory. The Good: He knows hes not a good teacher so just get someone to sign you in and rotate, or sign in and leave. HIS TESTS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE PRACTICE TEST. The EASIEST A EVER!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take take take!!!!!!!!!!!! Although this guy isn't the best teacher and is sometimes hard to understand, he tries soo hard to to help his students by giving alot of extra credit and he lets you use a cheat sheet on the tests. He also gives awesome study guides that are almost identical to the tests and final. I would take him again in a heartbeat.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although he is hard to understand and the homework is tough, stick with it. There are two quizzes and a final. You get to use notes on each of them. He seems to go over things a lot more clearly when you review for tests. Also, the study guides are exactly like the tests, but different numbers are used. It is really easy to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes a little hard to understand sometimes. sit up front.. he can explain things quickly. graded weekly homework. really nice and hilarious guy. 2 tests 1 final and you get to use notes on all of them. he gives you a review sheet that resembles the test. almost a given A. highly recommended.. take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is definitely one of the nicest teachers out there! He cares a lot for his students, and will definitely help you out when your stuck. Two minor things are his notes are kind of scattered every now and then and he goes really fast sometimes- its hard to follow. Other than that, he's a good teacher overall!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2008<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really good math teacher. i agree with the person that said that if you fail it is because you dont try. if you do your work and participate in class you'll get a good grade. he's helpful when you're struggling and if you're on the verge of failing or a point away from a higher letter grade he'll bump you up as long as he knows you work hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of chance to get extra credit, very nice teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very helpful teacher, he replies to emails fast and is always willing to help! There's homework very week, good practice for exams (and hello, they're homework, of course they are graded). He also gives wonderful study guides to every exams. Students who whine are just slackers. Don't blame the teacher for that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Completely disagree with other ratings.  He gives students every opportunity to succeed.  If you fail his class, it simply means you did not try at all.  He is very knowledgable and he makes himself available during off hours and emails.  Very prompt and helpful--Worked full time and communicated via email 3-4 times weekly.  Best Math prof at DP</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the worst teacher of my life.  im lucky that i did not kill myself.  if you must take him....don't take an early one.  and only an hour at a time.  he has no interest in the subject, therefor feels it is unnecessary to project his voice past the first row</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was extremely hard to understand!! I never felt so lost in a math class before... He also actually graded your answers to the homework which brought down my grade big time!! The only good thing was you got to write down the whole study guide an index card and use it on the tests which does help!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Barely understandable. Notes goes by fast and steps are sometimes skipped. Taking his notes only confuses more. Not good at explaining questions. I learned more by myself with the book. However, exams are heavily based off his study guides, so know the guide to pass exams. DO the homework, it's counted. DON'T take if you need an actual teacher!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2007<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>why is he a professor&#63;&#63;  absolutly ridiculous teacher.  take this class if you know the material first, or you just love to teach yourself.  just about everyone in my class failed. CAUTION: DONT TAKE THIS CLASS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard to understand, hard to follow when he writes down problems. Moves way too fast. And asking questions wont help because of his accent. If you can learn from the textbook, you won't have a problem. If you need the teacher to teach... try to find someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
