Really understood the subject he teaches and if i could i would take the class again.  Just pay attention and participate and you'll go a long way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2014<br>Class Name: THE209<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Dean is a wonderful professor and very sweet man. Although he can be a bit disorganized at times, he is very laid back, and will excuse the same behavior from his students. He is very experienced and knowledgable about theatre, and this translates into each of his classes. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: THE209<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dean is awesome. He's incredibly relaxed and hilarious. His lectures were always funny.  He was really understanding about late assignments or missing a class. The assignments he gives really aren't difficult, and class is always pretty fun. Sketch Comedy was my favorite class this quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2012<br>Class Name: THE209<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dean was cool and laid back. Never strict at all on anything.  Sketch comedy was all around fun. If you like all things comedy, definitely take this class as an arts and lit requirement. Only big assignments are writing a few papers on sketches/etc. You write a lot of sketches throughout the quarter with a lot of improv and scene readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: DISCOVERTHEATE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dean is fabulous, friendly, interested, and he knows his stuff.  BUT he didn't seem to understand the idea of returning papers and assignments.  I have no idea what i have in his class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2005<br>Class Name: PLAYWRITING<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dean comes off as a very nice and quirky individual. What I did to get on his bad side I have no idea. He was my teacher,advisor and dean, and worked very hard to have me &quot;cut&quot; from the theatre school, and then while still my advisor screwed me again by telling me he'd fixed problems he hadn't. His good w/ little thing in class, clueless w/ big one</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I just love dean.
