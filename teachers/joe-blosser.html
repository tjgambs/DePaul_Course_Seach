He grades very hard, but it's worth what you take away from the class. Don't miss more than two classes, or it will greatly affect your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will need to do a lot of reading assignments. 2 EIP papers. The final was a paper. You must attend class for attendance or deduct 5% after you miss his class twice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2011<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Blosser rocks. I took his class to meet a graduation requirement and it ended up being one of my favorite during my career at DePaul. Lots of reading, but if you're not afraid to do some work and think, you'll love this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. I loved this class. Discussions were amazing! You have to do quite a bit of reading, some of it not always easy to understand, but he does a very good job at clarifying the text for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2010<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Blosser is a good man and he genuinely cares about his students.  His class can get a little bit over whelming for a full time student, but he his perfect for part time students.  He assigns an absurd amount of reading every week.  His midterm is tough, but the final isn't too bad. I got a &quot;B&quot; without too much trouble</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2010<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher. He makes his expectations very clear. Assigns tons of reading, but you won't need to read every page to do well. Makes class entertaining. Definitely worth taking. :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2010<br>Class Name: REL350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Blosser's class was one of the best I took at DePaul.  He really cares about his students and wants them to feel like they are getting something out of his class.  He's very understanding, kind and highly intelligent.  For being a religion professor, he was very open to all ideas and highly encouraged our different opinions.  Great guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His average score for our tests and papers was about a 75%, which I found ridiculous.  Like most of you, I was going to take this class simply for my religion requirement and to boost my grade.  If you are looking to do the same, I would find a different class. He is a hard grader and a lot of work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2010<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Blosser is very interested about business ethics and his lectures are for the most part interesting. He is not tenured yet so he &quot;has to assign 1000 pages of reading&quot; but will give you a heads up on what you can skim. Reading quizzes are easy if you read. Case studies are fun, but hard to understand at first. Not an easy A more an easy B-</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2010<br>Class Name: REL119<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took his buisness and religious ethics last quarter. I absolutely loved the class and it was really interesting. The only thing is that you have to be completely commited to reading the material. He assigns an average of 30 pages a night so you must be prepared. Also attendance is a big deal in this course. other than that he is great</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! I found him really interesting and he was knowledgeable on the subject.  There was a lot of reading, but he was easy to get along with and easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2009<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Blosser is one of the best professors at DePaul. He keeps lectures interesting and has the ability to explain hard subjects in a way that are easy to understand. Must stay on top of your work. Class is worth taking. You will leave feeling like you actually learned something about yourself and the world around you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2009<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor! Probably one of the best at DePaul but he will require you to do some work. As long as you stay on top of things this class can be easy but it is hard to keep up very fast paced and sometimes complicated topics. So take him if your not going to slack off otherwise keep looking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2009<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Blosser is one of the best professors I've had, and his course is one of the most enriching I've taken.  No matter what you're studying you'll come away with a better understanding of various ethical perspectives, and explore your own ethical identity.  Class is not just for Biz mjrs.  I'm a Hist. mjr and have gained alot from the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2009<br>Class Name: REL206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>super awesome professor. will require you to do some work and some reading but prepares you well. he will help you to become a better thinker and a better student. i would highly recommend taking him</div></div></div></body></html>
