    Take his class. Show up every week, you'll excel. Take notes. The lowest homework and quiz grades dropped. He's funny. If you don't get it, the homework teaches you what you need to know. Not a hard or strenuous class! You don't need the textbook either! Just the online code!

    Best decision, take him. He drops the lowest quiz and re-extends homework on mymathlab before the final and midterm. Exams are multiple choice. I got a D on the midterm and a C on the final, A on every weekly quiz, I still came out with a B as a final grade. How is that even possible? He always ended night class an hour early. Don't need the book.

    Please disregard bad reviews of him, trust me. I'm also one of those students who are not math gifted, and Zazi made it easy to understand and even fun!  Attendance does not count for a grade but you NEED to attend since every lecture teaches you about everything you need to know for the tests, and there is always a small (easy quiz).

    Zazi is a Great teacher, He made a difficult subject more interesting and receptive. There are quizzes, don't worry if you come to class you will be fine. His accent is a little difficult to understand at times but he does a great job making sure the whole class is on the same page.

    Great teacher. He thoroughly explained each and every problem in class which made the HW and Quizzes easy. The HW is online with mylabsplus. There is a quiz every week. Mid-term and final is multiple choice and some quizzes are too. You would have to be really lazy to not get a B n this class at the least. I would totally recommend to anyone.

    OMG! Prof. Zazi rocks!!! If math is not your strength you must take him! He is a first teacher who makes a difficult class easy and breezy. You must work though to achieve a grade you want, but it is an easy A if you are not afraid to spend couple of hours outside the school and practice! No surprises on midterm and final. Take him; won't regret!!!

    Zazi = the BEST! He's funny too! Never enjoyed math so much! Buy mymathlab. No book. Multiple choice test, so if u don't know something u can use the answers and work backwards. He's not picky either. Exapmle:I answered .014 instead of 1.4% &amp; he gave me 1/2 credit after I spoke with him. He really wants you to pass. Just make sure u go to class!

    For once I actually enjoyed a math based class. It wasn't easy but he explains really well and works through problems on the board. He has a good sense of humor and appreciates interaction. Wish he had taught 137

    four words "Zazi is the man"! if you value your grade take him, believe me you will understand math after taking this guy.  He breaks everything down and gives you exactly what you need to be successful in the course.

    The only people who didn't do well in my class were the dumb asses who never did HW, listened in class, and then complained about the teacher. HW problems appear on the quiz. Both HW &amp; quiz problems are on final and midterm. TAKE ZAZI! Just don't expect staying awake in class to get you an A, you need to DO HW AND STUDY! + he is HILARIOUS.

    DO your homework that he assigns, this is the BEST and only advice I can give you. Calc. is not my strong suit, so I am not going to say it was easy, but if you take the time to do your homework and actually do it you will do fine. Very similar problems from the homework are on the quizzes. Again if you want to do well in his class do YOUR HW.

    Good teacher and all of his classes are very easy. I took him for MAT 135,136, and 137. He's a nice guy and is funny at times. He gives out a weekly quiz with about 5 questions and that is worth 40% of the grade. Midterm and Final are worth 30%. Concentrate on doing well on the quizzes very simple.

    All I have to say is take this professor. He is by far the sweetest guy and such a great teacher. I was hesitant to post on here until I was for sure signed up in his 137 class because I wanted to make sure I got my spot! I have had him for 135, 136, and 137. He makes calc fun, class is always let out very early, JUST TAKE HIM. YOU WONT REGRET IT!

    Zazi is great and funny. I took a night class w/ him &amp; he always lets us leave an hour early which is nice. Weekly hw, only a few problems, very easy. Weekly quizzes which come directly from hw &amp; drops the lowest grade. Midterm was easy &amp; multiple choice. Final not cummulative since we did good on midterm.

    I could slap myself for not taking Zazi for 136 this quarter. He was SUCH a great teacher, his class is literally calc for dummies. Make sure you do the hw because the same problems show up on weekly quizes and exams--which are SO EASY if you do hw. He only teaches you what u need to know for tests, which i LOVED. DEF taking him for Stats SP Qr.

    Very difficult class, he expects students to know the material and if you dare to ask a question in class he will make you look stupid and make fun of you in front of the class. Rushes way too fast through material, none of the students knew what was going on in the class. Be prepared to spend countless if hours with math tutors when taking him.

    Professor Zazi is a GREAT professor. He brings the difficult subject matter to students level so that its easy to understand. This was the first B I ever earned in a math class. Sometimes you have to stop him to understand whats going on, but the bottom line is he teaches..you learn end of story. WATCH for the final though, its tough!!

    Great professor! He is very clear and approachable. Great with answering questions. For this class, our grade was made up of only the weekly quizzes, the mid-term and final. He always lets his night classes out an hour or more early. Nice man, and he teaches at a great pace. Take notes, listen, and come to class. you should be fine.

    I agree with everyone else he is a nice guy, but gets down to business. Expect to spend alot of time with tutors if you do not already understand the material, as he likes to assume everyone in the class is some sort of math genius.

    Very nice guy, but by no means is the class easy. As long as you put in a lot of outside class time to study, and keep up you will do just fine. You will be expected to know the material before showing up to class, which is a downside so you have to study outside of class and teach yourself.

    Horrible. Daily quizzes will kill your grade, you have to show up every day. Hard class. Assumes students already know the material, and moves quickly. Take Safa Hamed instead, you'll thank me later.

    Took him based on previous reviews, only to get screwed over. He goes way too fast, gives a quiz every day in class which counts towards your grade, screw one up and say bye to that A. I was very disappointed.

    You need to attend every class since there's a quiz every week on the prior homework. Definitely a great teacher and really knows his material, was more than helpful to meet with me outside of class. I had a C- in another MAT 135, Professor Zazi is so good that I got an A- in this class

    Take the notes, use the formula sheet you are allowed to have, and know how to do things on your calculator. If you do that the quizes won't be bad, and a the night class gets out early. Take him! He makes stats simple.

    His stats class was so easy, I got an A+ without trying too hard. Basically as long as you pay attention you'll get an A, he goes over everything really clearly. Homework is optional, easy 10 point quiz each week + midterm + final. Plus he let us out an hour early every week, so if you have to take a night class this is the one to take.

    He is a great teacher who teaches only what you need to know. If you need help go to his office hours and ask he's more than willing to help you out. Plus, he tells these really lame jokes in class that make it more interesting. Would definitely recommend his class since its too the point and fun sometimes. Those who hate him don't try in his class

    he goes through many examples which may be hard to understand. take notes and go to him before class to ask questions. quiz each week as a night class, but class goes by very fast, so dont fall behind. show that you are understanding and he'll notice. very good prof.

    Definitely would not recommend! Although helpful and being a nice guy, He definitely lacks the ability to teach the course correctly. Moves extremely fast and you're basically going to have to teach yourself the material. Midterm and Final are both only 20 questions and worth 60% of your grade. 40% are quizes. Seriously, Do not take him!

    Zazi is just OK homework weekly(not collected) then a quiz over that at the end of class after he teaches the next chapter. Always got out early but had to teach myself office hours are only 45 min. before class. Not a great teacher if you don't know whats up. Otherwise take him if you do.

    This class was a bust. Prof was very unclear in teaching info. I felt like I did all of the teaching to myself. Tests were easy mult choice, but challenging because his teaching or lack there of. Lets you out early. Mis-imputted the mid-term grades giving me an 80% rather than the 95% I earned. Kind of a dunderhead.I was one of the few A's in class

    Totally agree ! He has totally changed. i took him for 125, it was a peice of cake. Now for BMS 126 he changed his entire teaching method. He makes things confusing, especially if you are not a math person. Think twice before taking him if your GPA means anything to you .

    Nice guy, but not a good math professor. First, he doesnt give a review for the midterm or final. he says that everything we lean is fair game. no curve, and does not give partial credit. he went over 3 chapters in 15 mins, and does not encourage questions. no review, his homework is not related to the quizes and he makes corny jokes.

    WOW is all I can say about Zazi!Do not listen to anyone who may have rated him bad.Zazi is one of the best professors I've had at DePaul.He is soo nice and funny,and he cares about his students.Business Stats can be hard,but he makes it soo easy to understand.If you can take him,you're lucky!You'd be stupid to pass him up.Amazing,amazing,amazing!!!

    Zazi is hilarious, even his name is funny. He's from some Meditearean country - like Crete. He's good at teaching the material and the midterm was very easy. Take him.

    Mmm, was Zazi as good for me as he was for you&#63;  YOU BET. I am going to miss him once I am done with my class. We've seriously become a family since BMS 126 last quarter and I LOVE THE GUY. He cares about the students and thier progress as long as you show an ounce of effort. Never had to retake a math class at DePaul, like everyone else speaks of.

    I had BMS 125 two years prior to taking Zazi, I thought I was rusty, did bad on one test. That's just it, Zazi is awesome. He really makes you understand the subject and doesn't make night class a snooze.  Very worth taking and never contimplate dropping, just stick it out--you'll do FINE! Considers every 'trying' student.

    ZAZI IS THE MAN. He is the BEST math teacher in this entire university. He is the ONLY BMS teacher I am willing to take. And believe me, I've taken almost every BMS teacher at this school. So if you 're enrolled in Zazi's class, do not even THINK about dropping it, you will regret it! Once you've had Zazi, no other math teacher will do.

    He is not a good instructor.  I think the only reason students take him is because he grades on a curve.  You can get 60% and still get a C- in the class.  He goes really fast and it's hard to keep up with him.
