I'm in her class right now for a summer session. It is hard. Basically your getting a weeks worth of material in a day. You're going to get a lot of homework. I actually had to call off of work today so I could finish it... She does single people out, its not uncomfortable but i do feel bad for so of the kids. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2015<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't like her. She was an okay professor, like she taught with good detail. But she was very strict (she'll kick you out for phone use, no laptops, if you don't turn in your homework in the first 5 minutes of class, you get no credit). She also personally got really rude and nasty with me, she was unprofessional with the whole situation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2015<br>Class Name: HONSTATISTICS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a teacher she's fine, but assigns a ton of work. Personality-wise, I want to warn you: she is the closest thing to a real-life Umbridge that you will ever find. She talks to students like they're five and answers questions very condescendingly; she goes on a lot of tangents too. You'll pass her class, but you might not enjoy doing so.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>Unfortunately, Proffesor Esposito has been given the short end of the stick. She teaches & grades the way she is expected to by the school and doesn't give you much leeway. That said, pretty much every other math teacher gives enormous grade curves and tons of extra credit. She isnt one of those teachers and you have to work hard for your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: F</div><div id="right"><div>By far the worst math class ever.

She is very disorganized and hard to follow. She goes on random tangents and gets distracted easily. She makes constant mistakes on problems that she puts on the board. One or two errors is understandable, but multiple errors? Math is an exact science and as the professor, she should know how to do the problems. Avoid at all costs!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Esposito was by the far the worst professor i have EVER had. Although she says theres no such thing as a stupid question, if you do built up the courage to ask a question she'll either not answer your question or demand to know if you were listening. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT TAKE HER.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. She does not allow in class questions and the curriculum taught in class vastly differs from the online hw. I taught myself the entire class. She also tends to single people out during class and make the entire class feel uncomfortable. I got a B in a class that if taken with any other professor I would have got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is very picky...I am in college if I want to go to the bathroom I should be allowed to go she doesn't allow this.

Requires you to read the text (and pretty much learn everything) on your own time - but refuses to answer any questions on the material. Doesn't allow questions via e-mail or speech.

There's literally no way to do well because her teaching is ineffective</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman doesn't answer questions in an explainable manner, and flat out refused to take questions on the wording of test questions. she used mymathlab to set hw and quizzes due at 10:00 before class and would change the deadline at like 6:00 that same morning. she also goes off on completely random tangents that throw the entire class off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher doesn't answer questions very useless teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Esposito is the most challenging instructor and person I have dealt at DePaul. You are expected and have to spend 70% of your time solely for this class for homework and quizzes each week.  No bathroom breaks, no looking at cell phone which will get you excused from class. I strongly recommend that you don't take her as professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT take this class. I'm a straight A student and am only maybe going to pass this class. I study and do all the homework but her teaching style is impossible to understand. She does not answer your questions and her office hours are not accommodating to students. Don't believe her rating, this class is impossible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hateful professor. Assigns HW on a whim. She floods your email with announcements and last minute changes to the syllabus and homework. You can never plan ahead for her class because there are always last minute changes. Never returns emails and you cannot ask questions in class. Do not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I come from a Calc background and Stats doesn't come natural to me.  She is an OK, teacher, if you don't have an assignment turn in on time you will get a ZERO. She takes points off for every little thing!! She is nice teacher, but kinda rude to people who have questions in class.  Forget about getting help from her outside of Class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a good teacher, but she assigns wayyyyy to much homework. I go to school full time and I easily spend more time on her homework than I do all of my other classes combined. I would pass on taking her unless you don't mind overwhelming amounts of homework EVERY week</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her tests were not very difficult because she provided sample questions prior to the tests and she was clear on how she wanted problems done. However, she treats her students like little children and calls students out for things that do not have anything to do with the material, for example, getting up to use the bathroom during class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although her class was rather easy, she treats her students like high school students rather than college students.  If one does not show their work entirely, she marks the problem as incorrect, which seems unreasonable if you have proven knowledge on the subject repeatedly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Great professor.

Probably one of the best math teachers I've ever had. Explains concepts well and is willing to help. Gives you advice for the real world, which you can take or leave. However she has one flaw: she is super picky which can lead her to being rude to you. Can get on her good or bad side very quickly. Would take her again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2012<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's meticulous but fair.

She's so nice, and her class is very easy! Does great examples, gives you a packet of all possible test questions beforehand acting as a great study tool, fair grader, and she always is in a great mood, making the class go by 10x faster!

Willing to go over things more than once & will meet with you outside of class. However, she forces her personal opinions/beliefs onto students. Very rude when being challenged.

She makes you solve problems in ways that arent in the book so paying attention in class is a must. she teaches problems by doing them wrong so students can correct her which is so annoying. shes an okay teacher but i wouldnt take her again because shes so picky.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so nice. Like an aunt. She uses the textbook a lot. Don't bother her once she is in the zone and teaching something because she will lash out at you. She hates it when people leave to use the bathroom. It is not hard to get on her good side, but the same thing can be said about her bad side. With that, this was a really fun class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I understand that she is nice and all but she has terrible priorities.  She is obsessed with having students solve problems &quot;her way&quot; and wastes countless hours teaching us methods not in the book.  She also has a wastes a lot of time talking about her self and telling us &quot;how to succeed in industry.&quot;  Freaks out if you try and use the bathroom.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2011<br>Class Name: MAT100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THIS IS THE BEST PROFESSOR EVER!

She is incredibly picky though. She is kind and friendly, but because of her pickiness of the explanations she wants, most A students are most likely going to end up with a B or C.

She leaves out some important information, and make a lot of mistakes. NO take home finals or quizzes unlike what people said before. If you read the book you should get a C.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes a lot of mistakes.  If she understands what she is teaching she does a good job, but the further you go in the book the less she understands and the less she can teach very well.  Don't take this class if you need someone to hold your hand through math classes. but otherwise pretty easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved her class. I have never had a math teacher that is so helpful and explains everything in detail. She is a really nice person. She gives quizes everyday, that gets annoying but do the homework and you will get an A/B on everyone. Best math teacher I have had at DePaul. I honestly miss her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/18/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Because she was so easy before, she snapped and changed everything around.  Her example problems don't explain sh**, the book doesn't explain sh**, she collects and grades your homework with problems that she didn't explain, and she quizzes you with problems NOT from the homework. The final's takehome but only 20% of your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2006<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is pretty easy and lets you use notes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is nice but she makes A LOT of mistakes which kind of killed her credibility.  Quiz every day (from HW), midterm, final (both worth 40%).Gave a sample of midterm, changed numbers on a real one.  Final was a take home. Basically no reason why you should get less than an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2006<br>Class Name: BUSCALC126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite Math teacher ever!!!!!!

She comes in early every day before class to help students with their homework.  She does examples directly from the book, so you know it will be relevant to the homework.  Calculus is a hard class, but if you're willing to put the time in to learn it, you will do well in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: 125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have a pretty good understanding of Calc.  This professor is a total moron.  One must know Calculus before one can teach it.  She most definitely does not know what she is doing.  Every class she gets 2nd guessed by students and she only knows the answers because she has her little cheat sheets up there with her  as she writes them on the board.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2005<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you dont get an A in this, your a pure idiot.</div></div></div></body></html>
