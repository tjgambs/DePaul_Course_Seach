I have taken him twice. He has a lot of teaching experience under his belt and just wants to share his experiences with incoming teachers. He is a very sweet man and his classes are not too difficult. You may want to blow it off because he is so lenient but really engage with the class if you want to learn. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2014<br>Class Name: SCU337<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bensdorf puts a lot of emphasis on group projects, which is challenging at first but teaches you a lot. Group projects will never be an issue again. Basic course that has easy readings. Keep up and pay attention and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2014<br>Class Name: SCU339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

He truly pushes his students to think beyond curriculum and remind his students how much more we are to student's lives than teachers. He is a kind man and his class is never boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2011<br>Class Name: LSI552<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, very nice.

He's such a nice guy and one of DePaul's best. The class was interesting. We had to write a midterm paper, class presentation and a video documentary. He is willing to help in any way possible and respects the different opinions. Take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2009<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love Mr. Bensdorf! He is so kind and offers a unique perspective to child development. He has an incredible amount of experience in the suject of development and in teaching. He strives to make everyone part of class and creates an extemely comfortable atmosphere. I would love to have him for other classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2009<br>Class Name: SCU336<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such a kind man and wants everyone to do well.  He used to teach elementary school, so he will read stories to the class. It's great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2009<br>Class Name: SCU337<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class i mostly based around group presentations.  Very easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2008<br>Class Name: SCU337<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A. Mostly class discussions between the students. There were several group projects that he graded very leniently. Nice man, full of insights. He is just too nice and extremely encouraging.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2008<br>Class Name: LSI346<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fairly easy course, textbook was assigned with reading, but was only referenced a few times- you could get by without it, probably. Had fun guest speakers. Fairly easy grader. Talks a lot about his own experiences in teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2007<br>Class Name: SCU336<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy-totally sweet.  I felt like a lot of content from the text wasn't really elaborated on in class.  Class was never lecture-always discussion based.  Easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2007<br>Class Name: SCU336<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is ridiculously easy.  Participation makes up 40% of grade, but you are allowed a miss.  Only work is three reading journals (which take about a half hour to complete, even if you haven't done the reading) and a final project.  Is a very nice guy, but class was usually more of a discussion than a class.  Would recommend for an easy A.</div></div></div></body></html>
