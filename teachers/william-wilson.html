Fun and USEFUL class!Prof. Wilson has a wealth of practical teaching experience that many of DePaul's grad profs lack. He teaches us to use artto motivate and drive instruction across content areas. We practice everything from dramatic and interactive read-alouds to movement and puppet making.He is a definite must-take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2011<br>Class Name: TL425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wilson is quite animated.  The class is fun, interesting, and useful to our future occupation as educators.  He teaches you how to plan lessons using different models and you are able to actually use those lessons as a student teacher.  I enjoyed listening to his stories.  He was a principal in his tenure and loves teaching at Depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2009<br>Class Name: TL424<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wilson is extremely helpful! He's also exciting and passionate about teaching. A three hour class seems like one hour. Group discussions get a bit heated so it's difficult not to participate. His class is interesting and non-stop fun!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2009<br>Class Name: EE344<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hilarious teacher, very passionate about his job and loves what he does. Don't be shy in his class-he loves it when you get into the art and music! Definitely a fun guy. Although I admittedly learned relatively little in terms of names, dates, etc...I got loads and loads of ideas for my future classroom. Best part-No grueling final!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2009<br>Class Name: EE344<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome. He is the only professor, so far, that has made a 3 hour night class fun and go by fast. Basically, we made art projects during class and had open book quizzes. No Final. Amazing class and professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2009<br>Class Name: EE344<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>by far the best professor i've had at depaul. he is the most passionate, most exciting person in his field of study. the class is an easy A and you'll never forget professor wilson. he's one of those amazing people you want in your life</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2008<br>Class Name: ECE286<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2008<br>Class Name: ECE286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can honestly say that I've never had a professor like him.  He's pretty funny and the class is an easy A! We spend most of the time doing small art projects, 3 hours goes by pretty fast in this class.  Take him! I repeat, EASY A!!</div></div></div></body></html>
