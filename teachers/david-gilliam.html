He is unorganized, showed up 30 minutes late for class once, and picks favorites. He doesn't accept other interpretations of the literature and forces you to conform to his point of view. Never answers emails or if he does, he responds at least a week later. Don't take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Legit worst Spanish teacher at DePaul. Unprepared, talks in circles, and makes the class a joke to attend.  Do not recommend to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2012<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst prof EVER. He never comes prepared, he doesn't read or use the book so your grade is shot, and he doesn't work well with students who struggle. He is completely disorganized and you won't find out about the details of assignments until the day they're due. If you take this prof, I seriously wish you good luck in getting an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2012<br>Class Name: LST200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perhaps the worst class I have ever taken. This guy thinks he knows it all and assumes that you should know it all as well. All he does in class is talk and his assignments are NEVER clear and his online page is a MESS! I strongly advise you not to take a class with him.(like others have said he is a nice guy but a bad teacher)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2011<br>Class Name: SPN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.G is a great professor, he is good in his subject and very understanding.  He is demanding when it comes to work, if you do your readings and your work, you won't have a problem passing his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2011<br>Class Name: SPN220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was beyond boring and hard to follow. Dr. G seems like a nice guy but is not a good teacher. I was confused the entire quarter and never really knew what was going on.He lectured for the entire class period and never really involved students in the discussion. Very disorganized, and unclear about expectations. Most def do not recommend!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2010<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely difficult to understand. Terrible grader, and always late with his grading. Does not help people actually understand what is in the book. Very unorganized. Avoid!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2010<br>Class Name: SPN220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor was very unclear and seemed to be unorganized.  We did not get a single graded assignment back until the 9th week of class.  He has a very strict attendance policy and puts a lot of weight on participation.  Think twice before taking this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2009<br>Class Name: SPN203<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Two solo presentations, a group video project, two oral exams, and participation make up the grade in this class. The quarter is done and I don't know half of my grades for those projects. He's unorganized, forgets things easily, and can often be VERY confusing when he's asking you something. He's a nice guy, but I don't recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely redundant! He's a very nice guy, but also very unorganized. There is so much reading in his class and over the same stuff! He really thinks his class is the only one everyone is taking. Class honestly bored me, but I must say he is very helpful and also an easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy, but kind of goes off subject and lectures on random things.A lot of reading, but he gives study guides for midterm. No final, just class presentation and research paper (8-10pgs). Class subject is interesting, but the class could be more structured.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2007<br>Class Name: LST200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good teacher.

We were assigned readings and I only did up to page 36 when we're supposed to be passed 300. I am confident I'll do well in his class.

Shows up to class late all the time, and doesnt even know what he talks about half the time.  He grades you on your writing and grammer more than the content itself. He assigns SOO much readings and you dont even cover them in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2004<br>Class Name: LST200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great enthusiasm, but terribly disorganized.
