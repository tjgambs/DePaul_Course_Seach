    Professor Dempsey was great. Due to our class taking place in the summer session, it was a 3 hour long lecture. She still managed to keep things interesting and informative, and lecture rarely felt dry. Two exams and an essay, plus graded attendance. My favorite professor I've had at DePaul!

    Great professor. Very knowledgable because she's traveled a lot. She's very clear about what matters in the lecturesreading, and will literally say, "This is on the exam". The exams are all essay questions, but if you just pay attention and write down what she says too, it's an easy A. If only all professors were as clear as her! We'll miss her!

    I was always surprised whenever class was over.  She gives clear instructions on the essays and even gives study guides to the tests.  She even makes sure that you do well as she wants students to succeed.  If you have to take a religion class, take this one with her.

    She enjoys what she teaches which can really make or break a class.  Because she likes what she's teaching, lectures are engaging and I find myself surprised when the class is over. Yes, you do have to pay attention, I wouldn't want to be one of the students that sat on their laptop trolling Facebook during lecture when test days come around.

    She is clear in all lectures and provides clear instructions on papers.  If you need to take a religious dimension class, take GEO 204 and it all needs to be with Dr. Dempsey. She is the best professor for any geography of religion class out there.

    Not gonna lie, she's probably the greatest professor I have ever had! I learned so much more in her class than I had expected. She is very knowledgeable! If you need help, she will be there for you 100%. She seems to have a lot of experience which she brings to the classroom and make for a great learning experience. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

    This was a well rounded class where we discussed the 3 abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) but we also unexpectedly focused mostly on Ireland. This was nowhere in the course description but it was actually interesting. I learned A TON in this class and it's worth it for that alone. Prof is fair and brings a nice energy to class.

    Not exaggerating when I say she is probably the nicest teacher I have EVER had.  You don't really have to do the readings, just pay attention in class, and she'll explain literally everything you need to know.  Thought the class would be boring but she made it worth coming to. Fantastic teacher.  Would recommend to everybody I know.

    2 essay tests (1 is take home)and 2 papers. She was very clear what would be on the exams, so just answer the study guide questions. She posted readings for every class, but I didn't read any and still got an A.

    One of the nicest teachers I've ever had. She's incredibly knowledgeable in the subject and really wants to see everyone succeed. There are required readings, I don't think I did any of them but the class was still fairly easy. Tests are fairly easy. Attendance is required but we always took a break which was great. Shes awesome, great teacher!

    She was awesome and very friendly and considerate. All of the material was presented clearly and in a fun manner. She gives short breaks during class so you don't get bored, and you can pretty much get by without doing ANY of the reading. Only 2 exams and 1 paper and that was it.

    Professor Dempsey is AMAZING! She makes this class so interesting. If you need to fulfill an understanding the past requirement take her. We had 2 tests which are easy and a research paper which wasn't bad at all. You enter the class with an A and you leave with an A. She is awesome.

    Professor Dempsey is a perfect example of an overall great professor. She makes class really interesting and goes through info fast in class so you are never bored. Tests aren't hard if you take good notes. I solely took this class to fulfill a requirement and left wanting to learn more. Highly recommend this professor.

    She is a great professor; cares about her students &amp; very helpful when you need help. I had no interest in religion but her class was quite interesting. She uses smart PowerPoint slides meaning fewer text &amp; clear points, so just copy that &amp; you will do fine on the quizzes. It was a summer class &amp; we had: 2 quizzes, a final paper, &amp; short readings.

    GREAT teacher. Was sooooo helpful and fair. Didn't have a huge interest on the topic going in, but she made it enjoyable. Very accessible for outside help and wants you to do well. Would recommend her to everyone and would definitely take another class with her.

    Among the best! Took her for a subject I was moderately interested in (religious geography) and was blown away. She makes class fun, intriguing, and you can tell she's passionate about the content &amp; teaching. 2 exams, short answer style, so you gotta know your stuff! But she's there to help you in any way. Got an A and would take her again.

    Honestly, loved this class and this professor. Never met a professor that is so crystal clear! She loves the subject and she knows how to convey the materials in a easy-to-learn fashion. The papers were okay, but the exams were very fair. She's a very reasonable person and fair with grades in class. TAKE HER CLASSES. SHE'S AWESOME

    I took this course for my religion requirement. I don't really like religion but I really enjoyed this class. She made everything sooooo interesting and easy to learn! She tells you exactly what is on each exam and has great handouts for the 2 essays and 2 exams. She loves the subject which is great! And is easy to talk to.

    Awesome teacher! Super helpful and nice. Taken many classes with her. Best teacher at DePaul. Highly recommended, very interesting subjects, very knowledgable. Been everywhere on the globe!! You will learn a lot, tests are fairly difficult but study guide provided and you'll want to study and learn about the topics!
