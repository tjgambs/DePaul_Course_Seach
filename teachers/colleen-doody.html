It's certainly a lot of reading but she's very knowledgeable and doesn't expect you to memorize everything. I also approached her about having a hard time this quarter and she was very sympathetic and supportive. Would take again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2015<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not into history at all, and I'm still not after this class, but prof. Doody was very clear, and I actually did learn a lot (even though it was boring af). LOTS of reading (as with any history class), but mostly from primary sources rather than a textbook. Her lectures are not too long or too short, and she's very responsive to questions. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: HST240<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I get regular AB grades but this lady doesn't even take the time to get to know you. You're in a class of 40 and all she does is talk. When she asks people to ask a question the rooms silent until someone who talks all the time responds. She is very boring. Tons of reading. The finals will tell you if you pass or not. Last minute bummer</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2014<br>Class Name: HST240<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Doody's history of chicago class was a wonderful experience.  I don't think I've learned more in another class during my tenure at DePaul.  Professor Doody is passionate about history and it shows. I'd recommend this course to anyone who is interested in chicago. If you need a history credit, take a Doody class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2013<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great lady and she is really passionate about history. This class with her is not for you if you want a truly high intense amount of reading. The novels were very dry and had a lot of unnecessary information (even stated by Doody herself) but you are forced to read it so you can complete assignments. She requires attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unclear expectations and a very slow grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: HST375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've had at DePaul. As long as you do the reading and participate in class, you should be fine. She is incredibly nice and knowledgable about what she's teaching. I highly recommend Professor Doody.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2012<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Doody is great. This class is a lot of reading and a lot of writing, but the writing assignments are small and mostly reading reviews. If you keep up, you'll be fine. Participation and attendance is crucial. She's a difficult grader, but she's also incredibly clear about what she wants.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2012<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved her! Lots of reading. But if you keep up and participate in class, you'll be fine. She really knows what she's talking about. I highly recommend her for this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2012<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is rather harsh on the grading and quite nit picky as well. She takes quite a bit of time to grade things and personally I feel that she overloads herself with so assignments to grade. Read the books and be ready to discuss and the class is a breeze.  Don't read and she'll know. She's really nice though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2011<br>Class Name: HST240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! it seems like it'll be fine: shes got a decent rating on this website, you already know a good amount about Chicago, and of course her last name is DOODY! But do not be deceived fellow Depaul students, this class sucks. She assigns way too much reading (40-80pgs for every class) and shes boring as s.h.i.t. Stay away!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2011<br>Class Name: HST240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class sucks, stay away. It is so boring and she gives way to much reading each night. Also she grades the papers very tough. If you do not need to take this class then dont.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2009<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class sounded really interesting before I took it, but it was very boring. She's a pretty easy grader and a very nice lady but unless the subject is fascinating to you, you wont enjoy this class. A lot of reading, but you can still succeed and not read. The books assigned are incredibly boring. At least she is really nice and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2009<br>Class Name: HIST240<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doody was just an okay professor. She obviously knows a lot and wants to be good, but her teaching style is better suited for a high school class. She asks very redundant and mundane questions that are too obvious for anyone to actually answer. She has no tests and scantron quizes and 3 pg papers. Defintiely an easy B but uninspiring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2008<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her Chicago Radicalism course, and while she isn't the most interesting person to listen to for two uninterrupted hours, I certainly learned a lot. She's a very easy grader as long as you make a visible effort. I didn't do much of the reading and still got an A, but make sure you're on top of your writing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2007<br>Class Name: HST199<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dont know why everyone is giving her such a great rating.  I had her and she was very unhelpful.  She assigned me a paper topic that was impossible to find research on, then looked herself and couldnt find anything, but she wouldnt let me change it.  What is that&#63;  I'm a good student, but she was no good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2007<br>Class Name: HST199<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HST 199 is required for all history majors.  If you don't plan on doing the work and coming to class she is not the professor for you.  If you are willing to come to class and do the work you will do well.  Doody is very fair and a nice person.  Not a very easy grader but I managed to pull off a B+.  Took alot of effort but still, B+ is good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2007<br>Class Name: HST240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class because I thought that the history of Chicago would be interesting...but she made it extremely boring! I would not recommend this class.  She is not helpful and her paper topics are horrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>well meaning but boring. I had her for radicalism in chicago. The class was unmotivated, there were a lot of long silences after easy questions. her paper topics are awful (discuss how the Chicago Historical Society has changed for 7 pages).  She isn't mean, but rarely smiles.  Do all the journals and you'll be ok. It was a lukewarm class for me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2006<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doody was the best.  I could not recommend a teacher who hates dumb people as much as me.  Fantastic class also!  Radical Chicago was interesting stuff but she really helped in clarifing a lot of things.  Way to go Doody.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2006<br>Class Name: HST199<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very qualified to teach at this level. Like everyone else said, Professor Doody is extremely patient and kind. Easy assignments, quality class discussions. Is willing to let the students steer the conversation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: HST375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. Very interesting, knowlegable, and encouraging. Grades based on essays and participation. She is very helpful, always available after class if you need her. Great class. Very organized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2005<br>Class Name: ISP102116<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Doody is kind, patient, and organized. She was frustrated having to teach an ISP class with a bunch of freshmen that are gonna end up failing out anyway. I really liked her. Explore Chicago dragged on because the concept of radicalism became repetitive.  I should have tried harder toward the end.  I'd like to take a real class from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring lectures. Reading was decent. The class was good but the material was made a bit monotonous. Often she was unclear on her assignments and then left you with a low grade because you did not write what she wanted. Can't complain.. it was an easy class. Just not an eye-opener by any means.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NO!!!!!!!!!

If you read and participate in discussions, the class will be fairly easy and interesting. She is really intelligent which can be intimidating, but she's got a good sense of humor and pretty kool. I would totally recommend her for Explore - Radical Chicago!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2005<br>Class Name: HON103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her class. Prof. Doody is not boring at all. If you have a love for history this is the Prof for you. Her lectures are incredibly helpful. Though it is a lot of reading, it's a necessary evil. You really forces you to write an academic paper in the appropriate form and you will definately learn from her. Her class was the best.  Take her!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2005<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>name says it all.

She is a horrible teacher! The whole clas is about her lectures! There is nothing that I learned of interest in the class. DO NOT take this class!
