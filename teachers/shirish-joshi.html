    His lessons tend to be focused on experiences and real world examples. The content of the book is not covered too much during class time. The midterm and final were relatively easy, but some people who were not comfortable with stats struggled. Expect a healthy dose of guest speakers. Very much a seminar style class with ample class participation.

    He is by far one of the worst professors at DePaul. He doesn't answer your questions and does not even give you a rubric for your class project. When you ask for examples, he tells you to look them up online.  He never explains things and when he tries, he only makes you more confused. If you want to learn, take the class with someone else!!
