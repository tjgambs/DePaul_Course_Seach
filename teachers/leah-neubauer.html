Everyone on here who complains about her HIVAIDS class clearly slacked off and did not care about the class. I have never been more inspired by a class on a topic I knew nothing about than I had with Leah. You MUST be respectful to her. Choose your words carefully, be politically correct. Work hard, and reach out. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2015<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's serious and passionate about her AIDS class. As long as you respect that and show her you're serious about her course, you'll do well. About an hour of readings per week, long classes, but eh, not that bad. Oh and she's a good teacher - if you try, you will learn a lot!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took lsp110 with her and felt that the class was relatively easy. On the other hand, i felt that at several times she was rude when she was asked questions. This at times made it confusing to get work done. I also felt that she sometimes allowed class to get off topic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an amazing teacher. She is vivacious and fun and makes learning about subjects one may typically be interested in an interesting experience. Thus far she made my first class at DePaul the best class I have ever taken!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Leah is an amazing teacher. She is incredibly passionate about what she teaches and makes the entire class really care about the subject. I HIGHLY recommend taking any of her classesshe's wonderful!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2010<br>Class Name: LSPLSP<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly I was very very very weasy on taking this class. I took the discover class with her and absolutely became intrigued about the subject. We went to the most life changing places around chicago, and also cleared up a million myths about aids as well. It was probably one of the best experiences I have had in my education career.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2009<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Leah for Discover Chicago: Diverse Faces of AIDS. She is AMAZING and extremely passionate about raising the awareness for HIV/AIDS. I learned so much from her. It's unbelievable. She usually doesn't teach a lot, so if you get the chance...definitely take her!!</div></div></div></body></html>
