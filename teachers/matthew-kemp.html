MIS is generally not the most stimulating topics to cover, so I applaud him for doing so with an enthusiasm that shows he cares. You still learn a lot and pick up some excel skills. I'd say he's one of the better ones.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2014<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor and makes the class fun.

There are a dozen of quizzes and the lowest grade is dropped. There is no midterm or final. There is a group project with paper (5 pages) and an individual short (1 page) paper. There a couple of assignments which are pretty easy. I would take him again!</div></div></div></body></html>
