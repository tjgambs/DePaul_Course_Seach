I don't even remember what or if we even have a midterm, but it was around that time that I stopped showing up to class. Everything can be done and learned online, he provides links etc. I showed up for the final project and that was that. Attendance is extremely optional. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2015<br>Class Name: CSC223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Cortez is a very thoughtful, intelligent and fair individual. All of the material in this class was very interesting and beneficial to my knowledge as an IT major. I enjoyed his teaching style and feedback so well that I cant wait to take Ethics in Technology with him next semester!  </div></div></div></body></html>
