Lots of freedom to explore our own ad ideas and make them better. She pushes you, but doesn't tell you it has to be done this way or that way.  I liked that a lot.  If you don't like that kind of freedom don't take this class. The people she brought in who worked at ad agencies were great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2010<br>Class Name: PRAD392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was really excited to take her Creative Portfolio Development Class, but it was a colossal waste of time. She strikes me as the &quot;if you can't do, teach&quot; type. She has an attitude/is annoyed easily, is confused often and doesn't seem particularly bright in general. Her knowledge of the industry is limited to academia. Never handed back a grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really nice and funny sometimes, she gives lectures on the reading, pretty easy grader but somehow i ended up getting a B+ its an ok class but boring</div></div></div></body></html>
