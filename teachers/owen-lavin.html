Tough grader, however, Owen will waive final exam for students who do well throughout the class. If you pay attention and do everything he asks for (format, file naming, etc.), you will do just fine.  Never had to open the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2007<br>Class Name: SE477<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took the class via Distance learning. A garbage class. Book is useless. Learned little. You may have to consider cheating if you want to get an A. Tough grader. If he gets to know you, you're okay, if not, good luck buddy! He is a nice guy(when not grading) with a lot of experience and wants to make sure you know it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2005<br>Class Name: SE477<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good intro into project managment. Clear and simple material.  Solid knowledge based on industry experience.  Great for DL class.  Exams are fully based on lecture notes.  You have to be disciplined during the class - there are no intermidiate hw to force you to keep up with material.</div></div></div></body></html>
