Her nasty personality makes people not do what she says</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: ENG349<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Garrigan is a pretty fascinating lady. I have great respect for her as a teacher and a scholar. She is an expert and has a very intelligent and accessible way of explaining the readings.  She will call you on your crap but it?s so easy to just follow her rules! Show respect -Get respect. One of my best profs ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: ENG421<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the worst teacher I have had at DePaul. Although she is passionate about her subject, she has absolutely no respect for her students and treats them in various ways - as silly children or as grad students who have no other classes or nothing else to do but look at victorian paintings. The class was a total bore and her grading is ridiculous.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2008<br>Class Name: ENG421<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Garrigan is to teaching Victorian literature what Michael Jordan is (was) to basketball.  Students who want to learn and to have a transformative experience should seek her out.  Students who wish to muddle along with the same old poorly written claptrap that they used in high school should seek another teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is by far the meanest teacher I have ever had. She doesn't care about her students at all, and she uses fear to make you work. NEVER take her, even if you feel you have to. Sadly, she knows the topic very well, but she is so nasty that the class is unbearable. I would have really enjoyed myself if she had a soul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2007<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart, very well read.  You will learn a lot if only for the fact that you have to show up at every class.  HOWEVER, brit lit is her world; she is insulted if you don't agree.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2007<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's not bad, but she's not that great either.  Expect to work in her class as if you are in grad school.  Note: She will always tell you it's not good enough no matter what so dont feel bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2007<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible professor!!! Definitely does expect too much. I'm a straight A student and believe myself to be a great writer and yet, I received a C on the midterm. I could not believe it!!! She definitely takes her class TOO serious!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2007<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was said on a previous rating, but it's worth stating again.  Although she's very knowledgable, Garrigan can be incredibly insulting to her students.  If you don't attend class she will take it as a personal insult.  At least she reminded me of the definition of the word 'sardonic'</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2006<br>Class Name: GRADWOOLF<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a Woolf scholar and knows her stuff.

She is not only extremely intelligent, but also organized and clear about her expectations for the class. If you don't want to read, don't be an English major. If you don't want to study, don't expect a  good grade. And for God's sake, turn off your cell phone and don't come late! It's not hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: ENGLISH340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>completely condescending.  She doesn't realize that she is teaching an undergrad course and not a doctorate level. She is unclear about what she expects and assigns a LOT of work.  I would not recommend her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2006<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can deal with a challenging teacher, but she just scowls at people.  Her paper comments were actually pretty insulting. I would love to pick an academic fight with her.  She belongs in the Victorian age, not in 2006.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2006<br>Class Name: ENG340382<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Garrigan is one of my favorite teachers here, but you have to meet her halfway! If you're just here to finish your degree, you are not going to get anything out of it. But you will be rewarded if you are willing to engage the material. She is such a smart lady and knows so much about her subject, and she also really cares about her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: ENG340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unapproachable, rude and unpleasent.I don't see how Depaul can still hold on to a teacher that has no sincere good intentions for her students.I've dealt with hard classes in the past, but having to deal with a cold and distant hag makes it that much worse.There is no reason why a teacher should impose their own depressive state onto students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2005<br>Class Name: ENG382<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>whatever you do... do NOT be late for her class or be prepared to recieve the nastiest look you've ever seen... haha!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2005<br>Class Name: VICTORIANERA<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She comes off as very strict! There was so much reading and she hates people who come in late.  Don't take if you procrastinate!  I was scared at grading time, but I actually got a B in the class.  Expect lots of reading and a huge paper. Also, she has written plenty of books on the topic, so she knows her stuff!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: VICTORIAN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a kick-ass old school kind of teacher. able to show a class that the victorian era was not only innovative, but artistic and hard-working. yeah it is a dry subject, but only true students that like to listen carefully can pick all of this up!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: SEVERAL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perhaps one of the best teachers I've ever had.  Her classes will kick your butt, but if you work you will do well.  She is knowledgable and willing to talk outside of class.  She is the reason I will be studying Victorian Lit in grad school.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2005<br>Class Name: GRADVICLIT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful professor.

But if you are at the University just to gain employment rather than an education, beware, this professor will actually expect you to think for yourself. If you truly want to learn how to write, there is no better teacher than Dr. Garrigan.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2005<br>Class Name: ENG270<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found her very helpful and always available outside of calss.
