This is not true. She is not unfair but you are responsible to improve your writing and follow her assignments. If you put effort into the few papers and do all the reflections you should do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was an awesome class. The topics are interesting and make you think, and she is more than willing to help with anything. I got 7/10 on all my drafts and ended up with an A in the class. If you put in the effort- it is not that hard. You also do not really need the book- if you share with a friend you should be good</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely one of the most interesting English classes I've ever taken. Topics and even the book itself were interesting (pop culture, song lyrics, identity, film). Lots of smaller assignments but papers aren't too difficult. Definitely a class I'd recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely helpful! She gives you a lot of chances to fix rough drafts before turing them in. You only have to read her articles not the book hw she assigns....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't be late too often. I felt like I was in high school taking this class. Ridiculously treats you like a h.s. sophomore.  Maybe, the req. were the English dept.'s tho, who knows&#63; As a person, she's pretty cool and fun.  Classwork was boring, overexaggerated, & too much. Tough grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: 104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is great! lots of HW, yes (especially at the end) but everything has a purpose and they help you write better papers. she's excited, helpful, funny... makes the class worth coming to. that's a lot for a COMPOSITION class (ugh!)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>it's a MANDATORY class for graduation so not my favorite class, but at least we read some interesting texts on mass media and pop culture and got to pick our own research topic. she's really into it and cares about students, she's clear (sometimes pretty funny), you can tell she loves what she does. i'd recommend her if you have to take eng103-104.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes cute as ever... really loves what she does.. just don't be late</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher. She obviously loves what she is doing. As stated before, lots of busy work and revisions.

She seems annoyed with everything the class does. And so help you, never be late to her class.  Maybe it's just that i have her at 8:30 in the morning, but she can be vicious</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice teacher but WAY too much busy homework... pointless journals and paper reflections. i had more homework form her class alone than the the other 3 classes combined</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Erin is funny, sweet yes, but don't you dare get anything in late.  Anything is better than nothing.  She doesn't grade most stuff anyway, just critiques it.  Strange combo of good and applicable topics and useless extra writings like refelctive letters.  Well dressed, white, still quite young and i will repeat it - very humorous</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>man am i glad i took her. lots of papers (ugh!) but at least they had a point and interesting topics. freedom to choose sources--good. reviewed every paper with classmates--lots of work but helped a lot. erin was super helpful & cared a ton--good. funny too... she made it almost fun (good since you only get 2 absences). i'd totally take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Erin is willing to help you outside of class.  She is fairly easy, but the class is really boring.  Way too much busy work.  I feel like she didn't actually teach us anything either...nice, but not that great of a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Erin is one of the most helpful prof. at DePaul.

Annoying reflective letter she makes you write after every essay. Don't be late to class or else she'll give u a look bout it. Can be funny at times. It was an okay class overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>well it is a writting class, so yeah a lot of papers, other than that she is very nice outside of class, and when you need help she pretty much does everything for you, she is real sweet too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2004<br>Class Name: ENGLISH10<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She rocked, she was really funny, very liberal and she is willing to bend over backwards to help you out in a jam.

You do a lot of in class discussion, that sometimes seems to go off topic, but makes the class fun.
