Homework is optional and the midterm is 5-8 questions, final is 10. He gives a ton of partial credit so it's easy to get an A. Definitely recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Catoiu tends to cover material very quickly. It can be confusing at first but reading the book and completing the homework help very much. Although the homework is optional I strongly recommend that you do it because it will help you understand and can boost your grade. Grade = 40% Midterm(8 ?s), 50% Final (10 ?s), 10% Homework (optional)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was not impressed with Dr. Catoiu's teaching style. Calculus is a hard class in general, but the way he taught made the material harder to grasp. Wouldn't recommend him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2014<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Catoiu is the man! Super passionate about math and a great teacher. Midterm and a final, A on the final is an A for the class. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2010<br>Class Name: MAT261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm and final, homework is optional. Homework makes a nice buffer for your grade if you do it. He's a nice guy and is interested in helping his students succeed. Would recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2010<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is nice guy and doesnt give many questions on the midterm (8-10).Makes u do 20-40 hwk probs a week and only grades 5-7 of them.It's easy to get A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2009<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was difficult because I took it over the summer. Your entire grade consists of one midterm and a final. Thankfully, he takes the better score for your overall grade. Once you understand his style of teaching, you'll be fine. Be prepared to work for the A! He's a nice person, not the best teacher though. Go to his office hours!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2009<br>Class Name: MATMAT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Either this guy needs to stop teaching OR you need to have strong self-discipline, be well grounded in math already, be able to teach yourself, and have strong ability to focus. For all those that are like me and can admit that they lack all the latter, don't, PLEASE, don't take a single class with this man. He's nice and all, but he's not for u.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2009<br>Class Name: MAT260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stefan is a pretty cool guy. Pay attention and sit on the side of the room that isn't obscured by him writing on the board. Very straightforward midterm and final. Homework is optional but can boost your grade if needed. I will be taking more math classes with him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2008<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very nice guy. At first I hated the class and thought he was difficult. But now he is actually fairly easy. He gives a lot of hwk. His test are easy...because his study guide is exactly like the test. If you dont like math sit in the front and pay attention. He skips steps, but only the easy parts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2008<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He moves very quickly. And skips steps and always takes the long route to a problem. Hes not to good at explaining. He doesnt give many questions on the midterm (8-10). Gives quizzes but doesnt grade them. Makes u do 20-40 hwk probs a week and only grades 5-7 of them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: MAT262<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First of all, the textbook was terrible, so it was highly difficult to teach myself the things that he explained very poorly in class. I feel that he spent almost the entire lecture doing unnecessary proofs instead of real, useful examples. However, he is a very generous grader on tests, and he provided useful review sheets before the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: MAT370<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Catoiu is the best math teacher at DePaul. He has a great attitude and genuinely loves helping students. I've taken him 6 times and I've gotten A's through C's. He's not an automatic A, though - he only gives as much as you give</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2005<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>your midterm and final are worth 80% of your grade. study for them and you'll be fine. hard to understand him but you'll get used to the accent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2005<br>Class Name: MAT160S320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Catoiu was the BEST teacher I've ever had. A lot of people in class had a hard time understanding his materials, but I thought it was easy. On the midterm and finals, just write anything and you'll still get half credit. AND you can turn in your homework REALLY late. Watch him erase the board.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2004<br>Class Name: MATH101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great guy, very nice.  He has a little accent, but you'll get used to it.  Very clear about what he expects on his tests.  Gives out study sheets.  He's cute in the forign older guy type. Overall, class was a breeze and he was a good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2004<br>Class Name: 636363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>cool guy once you get to know him</div></div></div></body></html>
