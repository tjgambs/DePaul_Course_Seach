He's there if you need him and he may be sarcastic, however, it comes with a decent personality. His lectures aren't long and quite fun. PowerPoints are posted before class.  Daily quizzes but you can drop 7 out of 17. Labs are important and interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2015<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class covers a lot of material really quickly, but if you pay attention and don't miss class you'll be fine. Lectures are never boring, and he has a perfect sarcastic humor to keep you interested.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2015<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy! A nice introduction class into the science. Not very science heavy. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2014<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He knows his stuff, and if you need it will help you out on what ever you need.  He makes jokes and keeps the lectures fun. class is not always the whole 90mins which is nice. He has short quizzes every class five questions and if you pay attention and study a little you will get a big boost for the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2014<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures are easy to understand, all you have to do is pay attention and review lectrures he posts and you'll get an A. Also, he is always willing to talk if you are confused. He just wants his students engaged and thinking about the material. I never liked science courses, but this class changed my mind for good. Now I take science for fun. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2014<br>Class Name: 104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Aiello is the only reason Im still in school now. He took the time to sitdown and talk to me when I thought for sure college wasn't for me. He has an odd sense of humor but he is probably the nicest teacher I ever had. We met 2 months to get my grades up and he even helped with other classes. I would take more classes with him but its not my major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2014<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He''s okay as a teacher knowledgeable but he''s got an odd personality. Don''t bother telling him what would make the class more efficient or what would help you as a student he''ll treat you like an irritating minion. Some kind of odd Napoleon complex too. Gave me icky vibes during my semester with him will not take again. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2014<br>Class Name: ANTHRO104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Prof.  Aiello enjoys the topic and it shows. The daily quizzes are a joke if you review the lectures from the day before. The lectures are posted online and are very clear.  Trip to the zoo is fun, the murder mystery is cool,  and the tests are easy.  Top notch class. I was surprised at how much I learned learned.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was fun and cool. We went to the zoo and watched monkeys and apes, we examined skulls of people who were murdered, learned about the human body, and watched documentaries. The tests and quizzes were easy, the prof was super laid back. Just facts about the body, skulls, science, no math, drops quizzes and exam questions & E.C.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>I think Professor Aiello is awesome- he cares a lot about his students and notices those who work hard in his class. There is a lot of material to learn but it isn't difficult to learn it. The daily quizzes are easy if you just read the material it's going to be on before class. There are three exams but if you study, you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2013<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really hard class if you're not a science major...not clear at all for quizzes or tests. Very boring lectures. Decent guy but doesn't care about the class or students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2013<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unorganized, strict, and simply one of the most boring professors at DePaul. You'll be confused half the time, the other half you'll probably spend asleep. I wrote this review, not to bash him, but to warn you of false reviews. To be honest, I'm doing well in the class, but it is only because I have to teach myself. Daily quizzes, 3 exams, & labs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2013<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this class and find it very interesting. There are quizzes but as long as you do the class prep they are easy. Professor Aiello is very helpful when you have questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2013<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is by far the WORST class I have taken at DePaul. If you are a business major you are best served taking woman studies as your lab requirement. Very frustrating and annoying class. Professor aiello is severely unorganized. His lab's are downright useless and a waste of time.Quizzes+Exams+Final=60% Labs=25% Participation=15%</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2013<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is by far the WORST class and professor I have taken at DePaul so far. If you are a business major you are better served taking women studies for your lab requirement. It is obvious that the instructor doesn't care about the students. His dull lectures and lack of organization skills are just unacceptable! STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS CLASS!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2013<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are a business major and want to take this class as your lab requirement, AVOID this class at all cost!!! Professor Aiello gives DAILY quizzes that he just makes up on the spot. It is impossible to study for them. He gives 2 midterms that are extremely challenging on top of a final! Lastly, the lab's are a waste of time. Boring class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2013<br>Class Name: ANT274<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Forensics the first time it was offered (before it has a lab, which it now does) and it was my favourite course as an undergraduate. Professor Aiello is great at sparking interest and explaining things but the best part is he is all about being hands on with a subject! Biological Anthropology needs that hands on factor and he gives it 100%.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2013<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Show up, read the summaries in the book, do your labs and you'll ace the class. Its not easy to the point of being boring though! He really sparks interest in a subject that isn't the primary interest for your average student in the class. Amazing professor. Took this Winter 2012.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2012<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome prof! if you need a science lab domain THIS IS THE ONE! super easy lab, interesinting lecture, funny prof. He's understanding and and easy grader. However, you do really need to study for the exams but its not too bad if you actually pay attnention in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: ANT270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best classes I have ever taken here, period. Great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2012<br>Class Name: ANT270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First time the class was ever taught, but I really enjoyed it. He was such a great professor and I really enjoyed going to class. But, I would recommend taking some sort of human evolution class before since there was no prerequisite.</div></div></div></body></html>
