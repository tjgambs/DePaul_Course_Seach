I had her for NUR 310 and while I thought psych was a little boring in general she made it interesting. She is extremely knowledgable and very professional. She allows you to kind of create your own schedule in class as well. Overall very helpful, intelligent, understanding professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2007<br>Class Name: NUR640<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very professional, to the point</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2007<br>Class Name: NUR02<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2007<br>Class Name: NUR310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone who has Mona as their professor, is, well very lucky to have her. She is an excellent, understanding, caring, clinical instructor and takes the time to get to know students. Very laid back, and chill, but loves what she does and you can tell. All you need to do is listen and do your best and you're already ahead of the game.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2006<br>Class Name: NUR310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very helpful instructor and willing to help explain material.  i wish she had the opportunity to lecture more in class.  she know's her stuff.
