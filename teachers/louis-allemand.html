Moves at a turtle pace (a good thing), doesn't require you to be in class, doesn't give out quizzes or tests besides obviously midterm and final. Lectures 1 day, lab another day where he basically does the projects with you. It's called projects because the web design is the same one you work on the whole quarter. Accepts late work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2014<br>Class Name: IT232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Allemand is a very cool teacher that makes the material very easy to understand.  The course is made up of just big assignments so don't worry about any tests.  I do wish he went into greater detail regarding a couple assignments but over he is a great teacher I would recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2014<br>Class Name: IT231IT232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Allemand is a friendly, informative, and realistic older gentlemen. He knows his subject, has reasonable expectations for what is important in the class, and will be more than happy to help. If you find his lectures boring, you do not need to show up as all of them will be online as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2013<br>Class Name: IT1301040920<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Allemand is amazing. He's whitty, informative, and he will take the time to sit down and help you with assignments. I entered this class knowing LITERALLY NOTHING about web computing, and left the class with not only an A+, but an ample knowledge of the course material and how to apply it. BRAVO, ALLEMAND!!! BRAVO!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2013<br>Class Name: IT231232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Allemand is great!  both Web Development One and Two consist of helpful information also additional work time to ask for help with syntex errors with your project/assignment.  I highly recommend him for Ruby on Rails Programming!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: IT231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really good professor. Basically a programming class for a website. No midterm or final exam. Instead of a final he gives you a final quiz. Also gives 2 prior quizzes to the final quiz. Quizzes can be attempted 3 times nothing too big. Final project is a bit involved so get on it as soon as possible. Would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2013<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Allemand is great. Assignments were very clear and class was given ample time to complete them. Very favorable grader. Class knocks out SI requirement and only requires about an hour's worth of work per week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2012<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is an extremely easy class. He gives you ample time to complete all assignments, no final exam. Recommend Taking if you want an easy to understand class. Definitely for beginners that dont know much about technology.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would ESPECIALLY recommend him to LASS, CMN, or COM students who don't want the techie, CDM approach to basic web design.  He's a little formal/old-fashioned, but  show just some interest and he'll react just like you'd like -- he's also very good at letting independent people just do their own things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2011<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is super awesome.</div></div></div></body></html>
