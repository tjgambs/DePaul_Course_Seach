Coursework is relevant and the lectures are helpful.  Sometimes the lectures were slightly dry, but it is difficult to make an editing class engaging.  Very good in the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2014<br>Class Name: DC210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows his stuff and really cool to talk to. Crazy helpful. Needs to teach more of my required classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2014<br>Class Name: DC210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>John is very knowledge in his field of work. There are no dumb questions so don't be shy to ask questions. Just be prepared to work your butt off. This class requires a lot work! Mid-term (48 hour film) was the most fun I had all quarter. If you are looking for a skilled, kind and funny professor, John is the man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: DC210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>John is nice and knowledgable. His stories are great! However, the class is a buttload of work. DC210 should be considered for a Junior Year Experimental Learning b/c of all the outside work. You make a short film (with group of 5-6). Midterm is also a film project, which must be done in 48hours. John's great,but prepare to work your butt off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2014<br>Class Name: DC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Great person outside and inside the classroom. If you have a real interest in film and need a real life example of success, take a class with John.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2013<br>Class Name: DC210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic professor. Very direct and knowledgeable. His stories are priceless as they help you learn from his mistakes/triumphs. Easiness is relative based on your dedication to making movies. Do your best and you'll do well. Midterm is a 48 hr film challenge. All else is pre-production, production, post, and presentation of a short film final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2013<br>Class Name: DC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was only taking this class to fill a requirement, had no actual interest in screenwriting. John made the class so that kids who didn't like writing also had a great time learning. He references a lot of great movies to make the class really interesting. Became one of my favorite classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2012<br>Class Name: DC210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>John's a really cool guy that knows his stuff but he makes you work really hard for your grade!  He kept saying just because it's film doesn't mean you can blow it off...  which I guess is true cause I learned more in his class that any other at DePaul.  I'm totally taking more classes with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2011<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First half of class went very well. He progressively got worse the 2nd half. He didnt seem interested in the subject and came across as it being just another thing he had to do. Has students in groups give presentations on the subject matter that did not help teach the subject. Films shown were boring and made things more confusing. AVOID</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2011<br>Class Name: GAM228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Johns a good guy, he teaches the material well and always brings good conversation to class and is pretty laid back, however he takes absences very personally so I wouldn't recommend using the 2 unexcused he gives you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2010<br>Class Name: DC274<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had to take Image, Optics, and Cinematic motion with John. It's a class that tries to make something awesome like film into something scientific and lame. I wouldn't  say it was John's fault, because profs have to follow a curriculum, but the class sucked. It was difficult, challenging, and the tests were hard. I'm sure he's okay elsewhere.</div></div></div></body></html>
