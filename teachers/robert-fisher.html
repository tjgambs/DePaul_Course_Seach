    This professor is one of the easiest professors I have had at DePaul. You will learn nothing. Both coding labs we were assigned were about 8-10 years old. Plus, he practically gives you the answers for the labs.

    His LSP-121 class was a joke. I rarely went to class and I would submit blank documents in for my homework. I still got an A though. The final and the midterm are both open note as well. He seems intimidating at first but he is actually a pretty nice guy. If you actually want to learn the material though, don't take his class.

    This class is pretty ridiculous but with this teacher there is atleast some leeway and a bit of comic relief. He's not 100% clear with everything but he tries and if pretty effective when teaching. Doesn't really grade- just do it and hand in via website. Midterm and final are easy as long as you pay some attention. Nice guy, easy class, easy A/B

    Joke of a class. Midterm is basically group and he will give you the answer if you need it. Easy A for a pointless class. No need to learn this information. Very nice guy when your on his good side. I would take him. You might not like the class but he makes it easy to do well.

    He is a nice guy but had no idea what he was doing at first nor did he seem to have any interest in the subject. After a few weeks, however, he broke out of his shell. He's really helpful when needed and is lenient with assignment due dates.

    Programming can be hard for some, but this teacher and many other programming teachers understand that so he's not strict with assignment deadlines.  Very helpful if you have absolutely no idea what to do. I passed with an A- because I didn't do as expected on the final.  Lectures can be boring but that's programming for you

    Fisher's lecture style was painfully dull.  Heâ€™d go on tangents and was sometimes confused by his own lectures. Slides and homework were made by the text authors. To see your grade you had to use a grading program. It gave me the impression that little effort was put into the class. Text was horrible. Overall this class wasted my time and money.

    He should not be given such an important Core Course of MS in Computer Science. I think De Paul University should take care of such incidents to happen. It is not because he gave me a B grade (I got none less than 90 in either of the assignments including MIDTERM), its because I think I wasted my entire quarter &amp; learnt nothin.

    As a distance learning student, he was horrible.  Rambled on tangents and did a great job of pointing at the screen in the classroom, but it wasnt always very easy to figure out what he was pointing to from the video.  Assignments were easy though.  He wasn't horrible, just somewhat boring.  The material he had to cover didn't help much though.

    Difficult material.. but I think Fisher is overly helpful and caring with grading.  He's a nice guy, and I think that &quot;Computer Systems&quot; material is extremely dry in itself.. so w/e.

    Complete waste of time, you won't learn a thing and get an A, if you love wasting tuition he's the perfect teacher for you.

    This man is the reason I left computer science.  I learned/did absolutely nothing in his class and got an A.  He's a disgrace to the entire teaching profession.

    I really hate to beat a dead horse but, this was one of the worst classes I've ever had, I literally needed a coffee I.V to stay awake. Terrible delivery, extremely monotone, and a complete waste of money. I though Ivy League institutions placed better caliber in their students but, I know believe Mr. Fisher must have been a great athlete; sorry.

    I practically did nothing for this class and got an A. We had a few homeworks, and the final was almost comical. If you survived 373, this class is a piece of cake (with this prof)

    If you dont like to pay attention in class this is your man.  He doesn't grade any of the homework until the end of the quarter then gives everyone decent grades.  If you like learning, find another teacher.

    The worst teacher ever.  He has absolutely no organization and makes the material extremely hard to understand. He should be fired.
