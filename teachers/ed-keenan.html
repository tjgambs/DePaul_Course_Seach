I understand too much about bridges. The only complaint is that he had us write a ten page paper about bridges. After using both textbooks heavily, I ran out of material at page 6, he is an easy grader though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2013<br>Class Name: GAM486<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mobile games. Hard subject, directly applicable to industry practices. OpenGL ES is super difficult to get working, but Keenan charged in and took it down for us. We learned a lot but it was super difficult to get it all working. Mobile games is fun, and learning it with Keenan was hard. Next time it was taught will be worlds better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2012<br>Class Name: SE456<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Class. Made Space Invaders with C# using modern Design Patterns like Flyweight, Factory, and Visitor. High level class, you get out as much as you put in. He's spacey but intelligent, so if you follow along you'll understand more than just the technicality of things and discover the best methods or ways to do things. Grades slowly, but easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>read off his notes for the entire discover week, powerpoints were very disorganized, doesn't leave feedback on your assignments he grades etc. only used the textbook for the final paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2012<br>Class Name: SE511<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Keenan is a former game developer so keep this in mind if you take this class. If you want to develop Tetris in .NET with 30 other students take this class. Homework is easy. Final is open book - also easy. Took forever to grade - didn't get final grades in till 1st day of next quarter! Easy A  but you won't learn anything useful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: SE471<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Takes forever (and i mean FOREVER) to grade anything. Disorganized, but tries to help. Will not troubleshoot with you,  will not review your code. Best you can hope for is him setting you on the right track (which is fine really) You must study on your own and do it well .. don't assume that much help will be provided</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: SE511<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was a fabulous class, One of my favorite so far at DePaul. I learned a metric ton. The assignments were hard, and he puts on the appearance of being a hard ass but the grading was actually pretty fair and he's not a stickler. I had so much fun attending class and talking to the professor as well. Great Prof, would definitely take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy.
