There were three exams and four homeworks. She offered an extra-credit opportunity, which was extremely helpful. It is very possible to get an A in the class. The overall class evg. was a B- and 3 failed, but that was due to laziness.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: QREAS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, but boring and difficult.

Quantitative reasoning is boring to begin with, but at least she puts forth an effort.  She is willing to help if you ask for it.

If you have to take ISP 120, her class is definitely an easy &quot;A&quot; as long as you do the assignments. She allows revisions on the homework assignments and if you have a question she will respond immediately through e-mail. Definitely recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good prof, highly recommend.
