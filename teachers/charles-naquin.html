    Great professor. Class consists of doing quick cases in groups and then analyzing the results and learning some terminology. 2 quizzes and a final paper done within a group. Not a hard class as long as you study before the quizzes. If you can take management 300 with Naquin - do it!!

    Professor Naquin is very knowledgeable in the subject matter and has a lot of relevant experience. Easy class with case studies during class and no book to buy. Readings are assigned each week and are somewhat interesting. I really enjoyed the case studies which help to explain the topics.

    Very knowledgeable teacher with tons of relevant work experience.  He isn't the most organized person (missing handouts etc).  Tests are very specific to class discussion however are pretty easy if you take the time to study.  Mostly case discussions in class and very little homework.

    One of the top class at DePaul. You will learn the secret behind a successful negotiation in the work place and what drives them to be successful. The assessments were really fun and it will help you build concepts . Overall take his class with him you will not be sorry.

    Hands out one of my favorite grad school course at DePaul, what teacher would alter the syllabus to spend a class period taking about job negotiations? Naquin does! I learned so much from this class. It's very easy to do well, show up, participate, and take notes on the powerpoint and do well on the test.

    The class was intro grad level and he didn't always seem to be the most interested in teaching it.  As a result, the class was fairly easy (assuming good attendance).  However, he is a very sharp prof with great knowledge in the subject. He is personable and easy to get along with.  I look forward to having him again.

    Amazing professor. The class is interesting, every time we did a case study and that helped learn. The exam was easy and very curved. Final exam was a take home group thing. My group was lame and took a long time to do it, but I think if you get cool ppl in ur group it would be a blast. I would deff take one of his classes again.

    Professor knew material, very knowledgeable. Poor admin skills, tests graded inconsistently with many student with errors (mis-adding points). Tests from PowerPoint slides and movie, all essay. Would recommend, but review all graded material for accuracy and ask questions!

    Easy class requiring minimal work outside of the classroom.  Classes entail case discussions and short power point presentations.  Grade is made up of an online leadership survey, mid-term exam, and a short group paper.  No final exam.  Take this professor.

    You must take MGT 500 with Naquin. He is awesome! Makes the subject very interesting.  I actually looked forward to the readings and class exercises.He made class fun and I feel like I learned something. I talked to students who had other profs for MGT500 and they didn't enjoy the class. Take Naquin and you won't be disappointed!

    Great professor! Didn't think the lectures would be very interesting but they we're cool and the class went fast. Not to mention he always lets you out early from night class. Study for midterm and final and you'll do good.

    Highly recommend! Great lectures, and Prof. Naquin is really passionate about the topic. Grade is based on a midterm (study, it determines if your grade is an A or B), short paper and group paper.

    I would highly recommend taking Professor Naquin for MGT 500. Interesting lectures and readings. As someone mentioned before, your grade is mostly based on the midterm exam which you definitely need to study the class notes for.

    Prof. Naquin is a great professor who makes going to class fun. He gives everyone in the class an A or a B - its basically based on the grade you get on the midterm (which you should definitely study for). Just do the readings and assingments and you'll do fine. Great professor!

    this guy really is amazing, he makes what should be a boring class for non-majors, a ton of fun. Not a lot of work but you learn a lot. 2 easy quizes and a final case study that you can finish during class. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

    Prof is very nice and takes the time to answer your questions.  Don't bother buying the book.  You'll get an 'A' or 'B' depending on how everyone else in the class does.  Exams are based on class lectures and some assigned reading.

    Naquin has a grading scale of basicly A or B and your letter grade is pretty much solely on showing up to class and whatever you get on the midterm.  I did not met one person who got a different grade then their midterm grade. Naquin keeps class intresting but his grading is completely subjective to his opinion.

    Everyone is focusing on grades and if that's the case sure he is easy, but in general his class was spent more doing nothing and talking to classmates then anything productive, gave to much time to do EVERYTHING, would have rather had a shorter class and manage class time more effectively. In my opinion this class could have been taught in about 8h

    Excellent professor who is very concerned with helping his students learn.  Professor Naquin was thrown in at the last minute and he performed admirably.  My only complaint is that his teaching style best fits a 10-week course, but as he found out he was teaching this course weeks into the term he had no choice. I would very much recommend him!

    Good professor.  Interesting lecturer.  Lots of negotiations cases.  1 quiz, 1 group paper.  Class required group negotiation with 3 negotiation sessions.  Filled in for another professor at the last minute and did a good job of it.  Focused on high level strategies and didn't get caught up in minutiae.

    Best teacher ever!!!!  He is the nicest guy and loves his job.  If you go to class and pay attention, which isn't hard because he is awesome, you'll for sure get an A.  Group case work every week which made class go by quickly.  No final, just a group paper.  He made the class fun and interesting.  I absolutely loved him!!!

    He is a great professor. Very clear on his expectations, always available to help you if you need something, and his teaching technique just helps to sink everything in. I saved all of his powerpoint handouts, as they help you get through the exams, as well as applying to real life. I would love to take him again in the future!!!

    Naquin is a great prof. He keeps his classes interesting and relevant. The in-class projects are interesting and good learning experiences. Take him if you can, you will benefit from the class.

    Professor Naquin is one of the best professors you can take. He's a bit of a name dropper, but his teaching style more than makes up for it. He makes the material relevant and explains concepts and theories well. As long as you keep up with the readings and participate in class discussions you will earn an A.

    Cool professor. Expect a lot of work, but very interesting. One of few modules that can really be used in real life. Recommended class.
