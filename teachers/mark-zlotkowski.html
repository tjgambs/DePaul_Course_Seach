I had him for figure drawing and he helped each one of us every step of the way. He understands everyone has their own style and aids in perfecting it. So cool- he brought us veggies from his garden too! I plan on taking another class with him for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2014<br>Class Name: ART110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark is a phenomenal painter, and after taking this course I can't look at paintings or colors the same way. I, along with many of my classmates, had never painted before and he taught us all how to paint and paint well. We did four paintings total and got to pick each time what to paint. There is a final paper but it requires very minimal effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2014<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark is fantastic. He pushes you artistically and shows you things you never knew you could do. He's very good at catering to students of various skill levels and you will take away a lot. It barely felt like going to class; it was that enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2011<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want an easy A then this class is for you.  He is a pretty nice guy, but don't except any effort on his part.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2010<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite teachers ever and definitely one of the best in the art department. Extremely easy going, down to earth, and nice guy overall. Loves art and his job but doesn't hold it against you if you don't. As long as you make an honest effort and do your work you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: ART115<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing man who is interested in pushing his students to do the best that they can. He was very inspiring especially when we learned about his own journey as an artist. Had him for two classes and plan to take another with him soon.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2010<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, so nice. Show up to class, do the work and easy A. Take this to fill Arts and Lit. requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely adore him. I only took this class as a pre-requisite for photo. I have always thought I was bad at art and really disliked it, but after having him as a teacher he made is so enjoyable and was really encouraging. I would definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: ART110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have taken several classes with Mark and you can always expect the same no matter the topic or subject matter-- he is fun and inspiring and pushes you to think about things in other ways. his classes always go by fast, and he is one of the best teachers you can take in the art dept!!!  We love Mark!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: ART205<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes just not my kind of teacher. Hes very nice, but also passive aggressive. He really wants his students to push their ideas which was good. He def has favorites, if your shy or not overly talkative you'll prob get a negative vibe from him. I wouldn't recommend taking this class unless its required to graduate, he expects a lot from his students!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2006<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a funny guy...amusing to listen to, if nothing else.  Helpful when you ask and answers his emails promptly.  Do what he asks, and you'll do fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2006<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Zlotkowski is very nice. His class is easy, only 3 assignments (at summer) and they were easy graded. Take Him...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2005<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark is so encouraging - he wants to push everyone further with their work. His enthusiasm translates to difficulty for some, but if you put effort into the work, you'll do well. He just wants the class to enjoy making art as much as he does. Great prof. Can't wait to take more with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2005<br>Class Name: PRINTMAKING<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kind of a difficult person. Ok teacher. I recomend you take the class only if you're very interested in the subject, and also, be ready to do lots of work. He expects a lot, but in the end, it's worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>love the guy... class is very informal and fun, assignments are simple but interesting... made me want to be an art major- if you want a class that will lighten up your day, take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2004<br>Class Name: BEGPAINT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark is awesome,really fun teacher who works well with non-artist.Not sure if I'd recommend him someone who has never taken a painting class.I had before so I was fine,but beginners might need a little structure than he offers.Wonderful prof. & artist,hilarious,always sees things in the paintings!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: HON202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very good at what he does, but he can be a bit critical esp if you are not art-inclined. He is not mean, but expects alot even from non-artsy people. He is encouraging and pushes the students.  Makes the whole class listen to lame music.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2004<br>Class Name: BEGPAINT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's so silly that sometimes you're scared that he's serious (he's not). Despite that, he knows his stuff. I'm a brat, but he knows how to deal with all sorts. Great prof. Has interesting taste in music- that he WILL make you listen to. Bring headphones.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2004<br>Class Name: PRINTMAKNG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mark is a really great teacher.

He knows the material, but he's willing to show some tricks to art.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2004<br>Class Name: HON202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is great.  He's so sarcastic.  He likes to poke fun at you, but it's funny as hell.  I didn't have any previous experience with art, but he's encouraging.  Take this guy unless you're uptight as hell and have a big ego you don't want bothered.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2003<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a GREAT prof.
