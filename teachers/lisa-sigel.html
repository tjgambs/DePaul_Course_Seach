She cares about her students so much and will help you no matter what. You have to participate in class because the classes are small, but you will want to. She makes class laid-back, enjoyable, and inspiring.

This was a class I actually WANTED to go to,  discussions were held everyday but were guided by her and turned to talking about whatever the class wanted to talk about. Which made it interesting.

You definitely have to devote a fair amount of time to the readings to do well on the papers and in the class. She is so engaging though that its completely worth it.

I would not say she's a bad teacher-- if you're not prepared to read, maybe you shouldn't be in college. She's pretty chill and down to earth, and loves to facilitate arguments, which is very helpful. I hated history until Lisa opened my eyes to a different approach. Very cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: HST239<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh, and she is knowledgeable, and although she discussed women in a class about women, that doesn't make her a feminist, but who gives a crap anyway you women hater.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: HST239<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was great!

Popular historians are more methodologically sound than she is. She has obvious biases as well, neo-Marxist and feminist to name two. Don't bother to express opinions outside of those ideals, or you will be in trouble. Should be denied tenure by DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2008<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class really makes me think.

We read in college. Overall, Professor Sigel is one of the tougher (but not the toughest) instructors at DePaul. If you come to class and do the reading you are guaranteed to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: HST210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was not that bad, there was a lot of work though. Many books, a really good amount of reading for each day you have class, and either one or two papers that week on the reading you did. It wasn't too complicated, but it is a lot of work. She made the material very clear, and there are no tests with her. It was a very interesting class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: WOMENINEUROPE<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lisa Sigel is a fun and energetic teacher.

No Midterm, cumilative final (she gives you the questions, and you need to be ready for any of them) has a 4 page pape, but does not offer positive feedback.

Only gives a final exam, 3 1-2 page papers and a few quizes that are super easy. She is a really hard grader on the papers because she expects something that she doesn't clarify.
