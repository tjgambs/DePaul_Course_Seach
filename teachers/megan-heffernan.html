    She's a great professor that led an awesome class. I read Shakespeare in high school and it was helpful but I still learned in this class. Papers aren't too bad and as long as you understand what she expects, it's pretty easy to get a good grade. Participate in class discussions and you'll get a lot more out of it as well as your grade!

    I enjoyed her class once students started to participate. She really encourages an in-depth discussion about the plays. We would sometimes spend too long on a single passage, but other than that I found the class to be pretty interesting. She's reasonable and fair as long as you put forth effort. You can tell she loves Shakespeare.

    Megan Heffernan rules!!! She gives constructive criticism on the few papers she assigns, she doesn't give much homework at all, just do the readings. And It is a good idea to participate because class is way better when you do and Megan rules so she deserves your effort!!!!
