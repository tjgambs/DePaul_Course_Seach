His instructions are vague and sometimes he confuses himself during his explanation! The assignments (2) we're very easy but poorly explained, so the entire class felt confused. Overall, nice and lenient guy, but this quarter he was not the best profesoor...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easily my favorite teacher I ever had at DePaul.

Such an interesting class, lots of different subjects covered, wish I could take a part two this quarter! He is a really easy teacher/grader, a fun guy, and let us out early most of the time. Lots of movies, tests were EASY!! Little to no reading, left in a good mood EVERY class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>So nice!  His jokes may be a little bit odd, but he tries his best to make the class fun.  2 tests (midterm and final) each with around 10 questions-super easy grader! Knowledagble and helpful.  I'd retake his class in a heartbeat!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2013<br>Class Name: CAN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Brenders was literally the reason I graduated college.  He was only concerned with making sure I learned what was needed in the class and was always free to talk when I had a question or problem.  I will always appreciate what he did for me and our classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2012<br>Class Name: CMNS543<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brenders never bothered to learn our names & part of our grade was supposed be based on participation? WTH? And every class, we just copied pages & pages of PowerPoint slides.  And this was only the 1st half of the class... I would definitely NOT take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2012<br>Class Name: CMNS360<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was kind of dry -- a lot of random information about concepts and theories that didn't seem to connect with one another.  30 question midterm and 30 question final. 2 reflection papers. Class was a breeze and Brenders tries hard to be witty and keep it interesting.

Literally tries to do all he can to boost your grade. The class is very interesting and not too much work. The readings assigned weren't on the test and no one read them.

He really cares about the students and takes time out to help if you need it.  He's a great guy all around.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: CMN291<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not say that the class was easy; however, I have to say that Prof. Brenders is a very good teacher.

He is brilliant - though a lot of people don't appreciate his sense of humor. He's very easy, cares about his students doing well. My favorite teacher at DePaul..

He knows many obscure facts and uses his vast knowledge of film, music, literature, watches, etc. as interesting examples in the classroom.  He is a genuinely nice person, and he is absolutely willing to meet students individually when they need help.  I've had him for two classes and would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: CMN291<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked him. Yes, he has a weird sense of humor, but I'll take anything to break up the boring subject matter of the class. He tries to make everyone laugh, and he gets extra points for that.I really don't why people wouldn't like him. However, his tests are hard. Study everything, read everything, and you'll be fine. I would take him again :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2008<br>Class Name: CMN274<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A for sure, but you won't learn much.

He's laid back, he's fun, class is never boring, & it's not mandatory.You have freedom in this class.Go to class, take notes, and you'll do great.It's vey simple, I think a lot of &quot;DePaul kids&quot; aren't used to that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2007<br>Class Name: CMN547<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Waste of time.

Very straight forward. Take notes. I've never bought any of his books. I got a B, B+ and an A. Tells the same jokes over and over, but they're funny and has great stories. Lots of power point, but the classes are not too hard to sit through</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2007<br>Class Name: CMN291<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seems like a nice enough guy.  Will try to make a boring class(research methods) interesting.  He curves like crazy and will give lots of extra credit.

He was hilarious, a very corny sense of humor, but he knows it.  Very informative, relates concepts to real life examples, a very interesting and fun guy.  I defintely recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2006<br>Class Name: CMN291<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took for CMN Research Methods bc no other teacher was doing it. SO BORING. Entire grade is based off of tests, which are VERY difficult. He let our class retake ours bc everyone failed it. Also, his writing is hard to read and the book was a brand new edition and couldnt be returned.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2006<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everything on his midterm and final is given in the lecture, which is displayed in powerpoint.  There were times where he printed out the presentation to minimize our writing time.

I took him for research methods and it was a blast. It was easy and you don't really need the book.

What makes the exams worse is he types really unclear questions and asks the same thing over and over again.  I took his a couple quarters ago and I still hear people complain about his exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2005<br>Class Name: RESEARCHMETHOD<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him the first time and it was ok and then i took him the second time around and dropped his class because he was horrible. i would not recommand him to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: CMN291<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is really quite funny. The class is very relaxed, but boring. The midterm and final are short (only about 30 multiple choice questions), but impossible. I attended every class, got an A on both field projects, but somehow got a B- as a final grade. He also does usually respond to e-mails. Good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: CMN291<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him for Research Methods, which just sucks in general. He tries to make it interesting, but it's just a bad topic. If you study a little for the tests, you should be fine. I bombed the final and still got an A in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: CMN291<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2005<br>Class Name: 251<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brenders is evil incarnate...that is unless you are a pretty girl.  what an idiot...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's a great guy, but not always great at explaining things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: TEAMS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One word to describe Brenders....quirky.
