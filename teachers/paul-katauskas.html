He teaches from a powerpoint the whole class, which can get kind of boring because I am in the 3 hour night class. However, if you put in the time to do the work, unlike myself, you should be fine. Just don't take the night class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2012<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor.  Unfortunately I'm taking the 3 hour class, which drags after a while, but so long as you do the homework, you'll do well.  He gives you many resources for the exams--use the d2l stuff he puts up and Cengage. Very nice and helpful, but this isn't a class you can breeze through--if you put in the time to learn it, you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible professor. he ready the powerpoint slides without explaining!!! hard to understand what he says ( he eats the words). His class so boring and quizes, exames are very hard. his grading policy %20 quizes %40 midterm %40 Final. he curves the grades. but still too baaaad. please AVOID him unless you are so smart that you can teach yourself!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
