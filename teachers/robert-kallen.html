Shows clear favoritism.  Challenged him on my grade and he couldn't back up  his decision. Not worth taking.

We learned nothing about economics and nothing about applying material to the real world, which is the point of the capstone. You hear his McDonald's story at least once a week. The only good thing is that you don't have much work. Unfortunately this is a required class and he is the only one who teaches it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2015<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>He puts little effort or time into planning class. He thinks of assignments on the spot and grades subjectively without criteria.  His nipples always poke out of his shirt, and he spends class bragging about himself and insulting the institution. The course consists of listening to stories; you don't do much work, and you learn even less.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2014<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice man. Subjective grader. He rewards toadies. If you want to be judged on your work, steer clear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2014<br>Class Name: ECO321<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kallen helps students to develop their critical thinking. He does expect a lot from students, but is willing to meet with you out of class to greater your understanding of the material. He is not an easier grader, all he requires is an argument and evidence. He has a great understanding of the material and wants to help in all aspects!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2013<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't drink the koolaid on here. He is a hard, subjective grader on papers, but admits he's not at writing! He is a chauvinist. He judges everything you say in class. Premise of class is "If your boss asks you X, what would you say?" Psh! Bosses talk to employees about baseball or golf, not about the US wealth distribution. He's not that rich.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2013<br>Class Name: ECO321<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WHY.

Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2013<br>Class Name: ECO321<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bob is a really fun professor. He gives you packets for readings instead of making you buy a book. The material is a bit tough and there's only 2 grades: your paper and final, so you have to work hard to do well. He keeps the discussions going and makes the class interesting, I recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2013<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the BEST professors that I've taken at DePaul. He truly want students to succeed in the real world and offers lots of advice/lessons in order to do so. He doesn't tell us what we want to hear, but how the world after college really works. Has a ton of connections that he willingly uses to help students in any way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2012<br>Class Name: ECO321<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gives much insight into current important issues. Class is all discussion which is interesting, but when it comes time to assignments/tests, he tells us not to worry and is like you'll get a point here, there...but his grading is very subjective and rather unfair...doesnt really add up in the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2012<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bob Kallen is one of the best professors I have had at DePaul. He works hard to get you to understand the way the real world works and teaches you how to be successful after graduation. He is honest and is going to tell it the way it is. Go to class, participate, and in the end you'll love his class. Great class/professor to take as a senior!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2012<br>Class Name: ECO398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kallen is awesome. His class is really interesting and he has some pretty cool stories to tell. The final is easy if you go to class and take notes and theres only like one or two papers. Definitely take him if you have the chance!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2011<br>Class Name: ICS394<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stop complaining, for those who cant handle the truth this class is not for u. Yes, he's connected and very political, but great class to face reality. He is a straight shooter. No BS. Likes students who work hard. Be real when u talk with him, he can read u like a book. DC Trip for those who r truly interested in government. dont waste his time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to learn about Microeconomics this is not the best class for you. He is knowledgeable but focuses very little on what the class should be about and spend most of his time on politics or general topics. There is a project and a final exam. Both of them are reasonable as long as you follow his advice. Not one of the best professors so far</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher.  Likes to talk a lot about politics.  A final presentation and a final test are the only things that are graded.  It is impossible to know what grade you have in the class until the class is over.  I would recommend him for ECO555.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2010<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY FROM THIS TEACHER !! He spends 1 hr bragging about how deep his pockets are and what a big shot he is.  he really does not teach and lets you out by 8 pm. Not money's worth.  Additionally, his grading is really weird and unpredictable.  You won't know what grade you will get till the end. If he likes you, you may get good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2010<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knowledgeable in term of insider tactics. Yet he has his favorites and your midterm grade will be your final grade. No matter how good your essays are or how much extra credit (which he does not really read)you do, your grade is determined. If you want an A, talk to him after class and tell him how great he his. He is very full of himself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brings his experience to the classroom and explains pretty well, but he is way too disorganized for me. Besides that, he teaches 1 week less than he should and sometimes lets class out early. I did not pay thousands of dollars for that!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2010<br>Class Name: ECO398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Law & Economics with Bob. He uses a lot of his own real world experience in class which is really beneficial. He has many contacts in many sectors to help students land internships. Laid back approach teaching style. Class isn't mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2010<br>Class Name: ECON517<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Econ 517 with Prof. Kallen is one of the best classes I have ever taken.  You will learn a ton about politics and at the end of the quarter there is a trip to Washington DC where you meet with Congressmen and Senators.  The trip was amazing.  I would highly recommend this class and Professor.  Take it as an elective if you are not an Econ major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2010<br>Class Name: ECO398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a blow off course! I loved it. Just sit and look interested and make some comments that you agree and Bob eats it up. He is a rich guy with lots of connections so stay on his good side. No wonder he was on Arne Duncan's VIP list at the Chicago Board of Education! Take him for sure. Easy A and very little work. Great for the GPA!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: ECO398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Law & Economics. Bob incorporates real-world experience into the classroom. He is great for recommendations and does all he can to help his students land jobs/internships. Class was group paper, participation and final paper. He stressed what was on the final paper again and again. Highly recommended for Econ majors!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: ICSICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is the best I have had at DePaul in all 4 years Ive been here.  His knowledge on everything is utterly amazing.  He is here to help you and loves doing it.  Simply put, you would be doing yourself a disservice in not taking any classes with him.  Wish he taught every class i have taken at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2010<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>How can anyone say he is a bad teacher&#63;  He has so much knowledge about the government.  All he wants is for you to succeed and do the best.  Papers can be somewhat abstract, but they're based off of the class folders basically.  Just keep reading folders and stay up on current events, and you should be able to get A or B in a breeze.  Knows tons</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Impossible class. He gives no direction on assignments and grades competitively. His lectures are based on telling you he is a millionaire and the important people he knows. Papers are not related to lectures. Hint write toward his views and he will grade u better. He says he wants ur opinion, but then will mark you down- WORST PROF I'VE HAD YET!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2009<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm convinced this prof rates himself. 2 papers for the Midterm, 3 for the final, and 1 breifing paper. His grading is all subjective. If he likes you and is interviewing u for a job u will get an A, otherwise a B is his highest grade. A COMPLETE JERK - AVOID</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2009<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bob get's the real world and as come down to a students level to try to give them an advantage in the work place.

Kallen brings real world experience into the classroom, and challenges you to think like an economist. Tests are straightfoward, no graphing, and he tells you which pages to study prior to the exam.

Knows so much about Politics and Economics.  Shows you how to intermix the two.  Recommend any Kallen class for Economics, Political Science, and Public Policy Majors.  Even if you take class as an elective (not to fulfill requirement), you will learn so much and well worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2008<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best classes I took in the MBA program.

Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Kallen is clearly one of DePaul's best. He gets you involve in the class, and keeps the students interested. He is very respectful, and it is clear that he loves to teach. Take him.

He brings real world experience and a dead-honest approach to the classroom, which is very refreshing.  His class is very easy if you're there to just do the work.  However, if you want to get something out of it, listen to him, think critically, and actually challenge what you think you know.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2008<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kallen is a great professor.

A team member that was the worst contributer walked away with a &quot;A&quot; while the best contribution got way less.The class is more of a discourse on politics than real microecon.

He weaves in microeconomics thru discussion on real world issues.

This was a special topics on Business, Public Policy and Economics, which should be held (and filled up) as often as Bob wishes to teach it.

Clear, engaging, to-the-point, and doesn't &quot;teach down&quot; to undergrad students. Has extensive real life experience in the field and brings it into the classroom to put the material into context. Clear about what's on the tests, and is very fair.

He's very willing to help you whether it's class related or if you need help with getting a job or anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2006<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best professor I've ever had.....honestly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far one of the best professors DePaul has to offer; he's interesting, doesn't teach straight from the book, and has great stories to relate to class discussion. If any class is available with Kallen, it will be worth taking.  One negative was the mid-term which comprised of test bank questions, it is tough, but it was curved. Expect to study!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2004<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>single handedly the best teacher i've had at depaul.  this man doesn't teach from the book, he teaches from experience. which helps bring his teaching style down to earth.  you dont even really need the book for this class, pay attention and take notes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2004<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really good teacher really knows how to keep you interested and makes a boring subject seem cool one of the best teachers in depaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2004<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is one of the best professors i ever had!!!  very influential and very entertaining class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor...his humor can get annoying, but overall he knows his material and teaches it in a way that keeps you interested.
