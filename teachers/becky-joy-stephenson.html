She stimulates interest in the subject by making everything relevant to today, lots of powerpoints and encourages discussion. Good sense of humor, lived in Europe for 10 years. Knows what she's talking about, take her if you want to learn not for an easy A. 3 case study papers, midterm & big final paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If she doesn't like you, drop out, there's no hope for you. She's incredibly intelligent, but she treats everyone else like an idiot. She doesn't acknowledge different opinions as anything but wrong. Maybe I just had a bad experience with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2005<br>Class Name: POLISCI140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She gives alot of reading but goes over it in class very well.  Make sure you write good notes because the final is on most of the notes and readings. She is open to helping her students as curved the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2005<br>Class Name: PSY140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Steffenson is a young, new, lively and very knowledgeable professor. She gives alot of reading but she discusses the reading in class so you can just take notes. She's real cool and opens ur mind up to worldy issues, I definitely recommend her!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a nice lady and very willing to help you out after class and by email, but she thinks its your only class because she give like 200 pages to read a week. We had three short group presentations, a 10 page paper, and a killer final. She is nice, but she goes over too much in one class session.</div></div></div></body></html>
