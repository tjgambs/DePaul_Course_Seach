    I took courses and did independent studies with her, and she was one of the best history professors at DePaul. Although she is a tough grader--she pushes you to do better, which is only doing the students a service.

    She is very difficult and hard to understand.  Her class never made sense and she is a very hard grader.  Always expects you to speak, most of the people dislike her.  Not worth the $ for the class. Do NOT take her for the 390 class!
