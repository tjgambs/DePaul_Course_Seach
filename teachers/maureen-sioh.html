It was my favorite class in undergrad, but it was also one of the toughest. The final paper for the class became problematic due to my lack of preparation, but when I asked for help, Dr. Sioh made sure I got it done.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: GEO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Sioh is extremely knowledgeable about the class topic.  I had a hard time being concise when it came to knowing what she exactly wanted me to learn from the class and this showed in my midterm.  However she offered her help selflessly and was willing to sit with me and go over notes and class materials until I got it.  Great proffesor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: GEO210<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Sioh is a nice lady and interested in what she teaches. Though science isn't my thing, she grades fair..Also, she gives you study guides well in advance..However, be prepared to study everything because the tests are very detail oriented.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2011<br>Class Name: GEO215<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bad teacher. Sh doesn't really help you as much as others think</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: GEO101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is one of the worst science professors i have ever had, she doesnt engage the students at all, and her grading techniques are so dumb, and you never have homework and her tests are impossible and the study guides dont help. Her lecures are sooooo boring and confusing and she jumps all over the place.  Nobody in this class enjoyed it. GOOD LUCK!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: GEO300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is willing to help you, you just have to show that you are committed to your work and willing to take some constructive criticism. Her classes helped improve my research writing skills, as well as analytical thinking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Sioh is really nice lady. Her lectures are sometimes boring, but I really like her as a person. Very helpful, if you don't understand something, she'll help you no problem. The material is sometimes hard to understand, but if you do most of the reading and study for the midterm/final, you will have no problems.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2008<br>Class Name: GEO215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What is everyone talking about&#63; Dr. Sioh is great - she is super intelligent, and knows her stuff. she does not dumb down subject matter, so if you're not getting it...try harder or find professors with low expectations, if you 'get' half of the material you'll have learned more than you would in most other courses</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2008<br>Class Name: GEO215<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I do not recommend taking a class with Sioh.  Throughout the quarter, it has been very difficult to determine what needed to be done.  Her grading system for major essays is nebulous at best, and she is a very strict, difficult grader.  Also, her contact lenses seem to give her difficulties.  Also, she gets a lot of headaches.  DO NOT TAKE HER!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: GEO300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Theory, Theory, Theory. Boring so bring coffee. Not fun to read but you have to take it as a geo major. Lots of readings and a fair amount of stuff to do but do not have class every week which is a plus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2007<br>Class Name: GEO000<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unless you are a Geography major, avoid at all costs. Very unclear as to what she wants from your work, grades as if you are a PhD candidate. All papers I submitted were marked top to bottom in red, most suggestions are not useful. Very discouraging for pursuing furthur interest in your select topic and encouraging for you to lose your mind.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2007<br>Class Name: GEO210<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Studying will do you no good because the grading is so ridiculous!

STAY AWAY FROM THIS WOMAN!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2006<br>Class Name: GEO101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful outside of class. If you study you should of good. Took as a science req., should not have done that cause shes a hard grader but let her know ur trying & talk to her about ur grade & u should do fine. She always wants to help you. She's so nice!!! Boring...but nice...intelligent...but boring...really boring. But she's willing 2 help</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2005<br>Class Name: GEOGRAPHY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absoultely the best professor I ever had</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: GEO391<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Scatterbrained lectures, course had no direction or purpose.  Grading scheme was insane and inconsistent.  Graded on material that was never covered.  I did all the work, but I still have no idea what I was supposed to get out of this class.

Could have been really interesting and helpful course</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's kind of hard to follow sometimes. as long as you do the work you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was not fun at all. I had to force myself out of bed.. most of the time I would just sleep through it. The actual class is easy.. you just sit there and she talks. For the final project, I spent a LOT of time and effort and got a poor grade because of my pro-buisness/conservative stance</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is AWESOME!!! She is by far one of the best teacher I've had at Depaul. She knows A LOT, she knows like everything!!! And I'm not kdding...but anywayz I learned alot from her, its no easy class tho gotta work for the grade. Higly recommend.

I took it because my roommate said it was really easy (diff. prof.) HA! The class was more interesting when she related it to her background in environmental science.
