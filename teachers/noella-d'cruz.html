She has no concern for the well being or cares of her sudents.  Her life can be mapped out by a series of numbers and letters, all of which translate into a sad skeleton of a human being and an even worse professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2006<br>Class Name: PHY151<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Alright prof, but grading of exams was very unfair.  Her concept of partial credit on a problem where you leave the units off is a 1/5.  Just don't make mistakes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2005<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Physics is hard in general. She tries to help and make up for its difficulty, but it is still hard. You have to be a really good student to get an A in this class. The homework is hard, but she does give you really good notes and shows you how to do the problems. This is an okay teacher; I have had better and worst.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: PHY114<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really knows her stuff but sometimes has a hard time teaching it to unmotivated students.  If you use the numerous resources she provides and pay attention in class it's not that difficult.  She expects her students to be students, not be handed an A.  Appearance is irrelevant and immature to comment on.  I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: PHY150151<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: PHY150151<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: PHY150152<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2005<br>Class Name: PHY150151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy teacher, gives you the exact equations you need to do your work and if you ask for help she basically gives you the answer.

She grades ridiculously hard. You can work your butt off and she will take off points for the most trivial things. She also has another problem that makes it hard to share the same space with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a bad teacher...she has no idea how to teach anyone but herself.  She is very hard and unless the work is perfect she will take off points. She has some other problems that will not be mentioned.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arrrgggg! She is such a nice lady, but such a bad teacher! She not clear at all in lectures and the homework is absurd. I spent almost 20 hours a week on homework and classwork (outside of class) and got a B-. She marks off for ANYTHING and EVERYTHING.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice women. Hard to understand! She like teaches herself, she has no idea what she's doing. Hard grader! I don't recommend her as a teacher. I def. had to drop this class, but hey, she's really nice and is always there for help. Not saying it helps!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Assignments are ridiculously long she is a very tough grader.  Although she explains HOW to do things in her lectures, she expects an extreme amount from the homework so that it is very difficult to get an A.  Will take points off for the littlest things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2004<br>Class Name: PHY200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Noella D'Cruz is the worst teacher I've ever had.  Now that's not to say that she isn't a nice person--she's fabulous to talk to and tries very hard to relate to the students.  But her teaching style leaves far too much to be desired.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2003<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has NO idea what she is doing...EVER. I could teach the class better then she could. She means well and is a very nice lady but always seems too jittery about everything. She is RIDICULOUS when it comes to grading, be ready to be specific!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2003<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
