Really understanding, funny, and infromative teacher.  Wonderful class and would recomend to everone...if he was staying at DePaul.  Best of luck Joseph!

Its like having an old friend in class with you . . . Very interested in the topic (the making of a homosexual minority 1940-1970) and a very thorough and intelligent guy. He breaks up the 3 hour class with movies and is just an easy-going fun-loving teacher! Highly recommended!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
