She co-teaches with Deb Stone, who is equally dull.  They both make powerpoints and just read them, while also printing the slides and handing them out.  I just get the impression that these women don't know how to engage a group.  Or it could be that I'm just lazy.  Stop wasting paper.</div></div></div></body></html>
