That doesn't mean she is great though. Stick to the original grading system. attendance is mandatory but reading the book and power points you'll be just fine. Homework is graded for accuracy which is my worst grade in the class, but the tests are alright if you study</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2015<br>Class Name: ISOM241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely boring. Duh, it's stats, but her class is exceptionally boring. Especially because she is difficulty to understand, not just because she has an accent, but because she speaks very quietly towards the board. She's helpful if you ask, but sometimes she doesn't show up to her office hours, so hit or miss. Would probably not take her again. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2015<br>Class Name: ISOM241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor with clear expectations for success in the course. Participation and attendance in the classroom matters. Very helpful during office hours and encourages reaching out for extra support. Overall an exceptional professor and a great course. I would take this professor again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2015<br>Class Name: ISOM241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>I think a lot of people were to tough on her. She gave us +10% on a single exam that I thought was fair because everyone complained about the 'grading'. The class is once a week, so you have to put in the effort if you want to do well. The material is far from difficult. These topics are covered in high school statistic courses. It's easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2015<br>Class Name: ISOM241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not only is she difficult to understand but she grades extremely hard. Homework is checked for accuracy and she does not give partial credit on homework or tests. There are very few grades going in to make up your grade and it is nearly impossible to get an A in this class. DO NOT TAKE HER</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2014<br>Class Name: MGT202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>She's OK. Her lecture is basically her reading the powerpoint, but it helps a lot when she does the problems that are similar to homework. She takes a while to grade everything. Mandatory attendance, weekly homework, take home midterm @ week 4, non cumulative in class final @ week 5 that are quite similar to the homework. She's worth a try.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2014<br>Class Name: MGT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lecture can be boring at times but pay attention when she does problems. Very responsive via emails. Weekly homework, take home mid term, in class final (not cumulative). Attendance is mandatory. She grades the homework quite heavily but she drops the lowest score. Overall she's worth a try considering it's only 5 weeks.</div></div></div></body></html>
