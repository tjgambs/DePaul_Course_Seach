    I find him annoying. I hated his class. He makes no sense &amp; belittles his students. He has favorites &amp; if you're not one he will clarely state it. I find his piont of views to be of someone who smokes pot. Do not take his class, you will be completely miserable.

    His lectures were very confusing, and went on forever! I think his favorite part about the class was hearing himself speak. It seemed as if he did not care about what the students had to say during class discussion. He was not helpful at all with the homework. He was was nice teacher, but I highly recommend switching/dropping his class.

    HE IS POSSIBLY THE WORST TEACHER AT DEPAUL, NOT BECAUSE HE IS HARD, BUT BECAUSE HE IS DUMB AND DOESNT EVEN KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT. NOT TO MENTION HE HARDLY KNOWS ENGLISH

    His lectures were very confusing. He doesn't tell you what is expected on tests, he pretty much makes you guess.
