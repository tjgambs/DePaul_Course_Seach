An easy presentation on your paper. Two short quizzes. One final and one midterm. He tells you what to expect and as long as you go to class to get those helpful hints it's really easy to succeed. Studying a little is necessary, but honestly just review the notes with what he tells you will be on the test. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2014<br>Class Name: MCS342<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME PROF! He knows everything about his subject and has tons of experience! You can tell he really wants everyone to learn & succeed. You can get an A if you show up and take good notes; tests aren't that hard. Textbook is boring and not really necessary. Ask him for helpfeedback, he is SO kind & helpful (also tons of great movie suggestions)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: MCS342<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Outwin is an awesome teacher. He is very easy going and his tests are very simple. Without studying I was able to get high B's on his tests. His lectures can get boring but he's a very easy teacher. I highly recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: MCS343<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. O is super cool and teaches a cool subject- History of Radio & Television. Test are easy, all multiple choice questions & one easy paper. Fun YouTube clips and movies. Highly recommend! Nice guy, fun class, easy work load- you can't go wrong!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2012<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendance is mandatory. Lecture style class, but interesting material.He pretty much tells you what'g going to be on the test. Four tests (midterm & final are all multiple choice, other two tests have some short answer, but he's a super east grader). One short easy paper as well. Overall, easy, but interesting class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2012<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really awesome professor. Super interesting and wants the class to make sure they are learning things that are actually useful and applicable. Study for the tests and attend classes. Other than that- great, easy, interesting class & teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2011<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is awesome! Show up to class, it's mandatory, and pay attention to when he clearly shouts what an answer will be on the test. The midterm test is half of test 1 (exact same questions, so keep the tests once he hands them back!) and the final is half test 2! Very easy grader on the one paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2011<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I totally agree with him telling us what he is going to ask on the tests. He is VERY fair and I respect him for that. However, he is EXTREMELY liberaly bias and it's hard to listen to his rants when he has no regard for any opposing views in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has a lot of real world experience. A ridiculously easy grader. Overall, I learned a lot and found him entertaining and insightful. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2011<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>*</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2010<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, he is a pretty good teacher. Goes off on A LOT of random tangents which can be frustrating at times. The tests can be challenging if you do not attend class because he often gives you the answers to make sure you're paying attention. In the end he's not the best but not the worst either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2010<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Outwin is an amazing teacher. He is incredibly knowledgeable and makes the class material relevant to your life which makes you want to learn about it. He is really nice and cares a lot about his students. The tests are challenging but you'll do fine if you study and pay attention to his constant hints. Loved his class, take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div></div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2010<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although the lectures are dry, he does go into relevant tangents he went through in the real world. He is very helpful and always responds to e-mail. Easy quizes and extremely easy midterm and final. A few papers that require some attention, too. Overall, a great professor for an intro course.</div></div></div></body></html>
