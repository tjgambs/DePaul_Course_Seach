She's cool but can't teach if her life depended on it and talks more about her personal life then the material.   People are usually lost on the test cause she was to busy telling us about what happened on Jay Leno the night before.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2004<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Accounting professor at DePaul!!!!!

Fun personality is misleading. I was lost from the start in her class. This is a hard course as it is, but on top of the book, hw, impossible quizzes and tests, she gives u a sh*tload of useless handouts.

For others, you will do just fine as long as you do the homework and take good notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2004<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tells the worst jokes.
