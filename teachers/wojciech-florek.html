This professor should not be a professor..he is unorganized, rude at times, and unhelpful.

He forgot to show up on the final day on time and told all the students to put the grade we wanted in the class on the back. I know D students that got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2009<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I question Prof. Florek's PhD. I could never correctly answer a students question. The study guide he gave for teh midterm he answered 5 questions incorrectly. He changed the final 3 times while we were taking it. This will be a complete self taught class with no direction as to what you need to learn. He will add hmwk Q's to already turned in assg</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2009<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is unreal and you will live in the tutoring center. He gives on avg 90 problems per week. He then changes the assg. after you've turned them in. He doesn't use the book to teach but the tests and hmwk are all based on it. His lectures are impossible and he will pick on certain students. If you can, take another prof!</div></div></div></body></html>
