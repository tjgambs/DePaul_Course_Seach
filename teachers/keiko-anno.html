However, her teaching methods aren't that great. She skips many crucial grammar points and teaches the class as if we were children. Easy A, but I would recommend taking a different teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: JAN101102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Just love her, always be happy to attend her class.

Doesn't speak English very well but she's still hilarious and does her best to explain the material and makes sure that you understand it as well.

However, I do not like her as a teacher very much.  She is a veryyy lenient grader, but is so confusing in what she is looking for. She does not teach the lessons very well! I have to go through the book and teach myself most of the lessons.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2010<br>Class Name: JPN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I've ever had!!!

She has a cute way of teaching and is funny. However, her accent is very heavy so it may be difficult to understand her. Nonetheless, she is very sincere and kind and is more than willing to offer help for any struggling students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2009<br>Class Name: JPN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher, avoid her at all costs!!!
