    This class is not an easy A but managable. 6 quizzes, 3 papers, take-home final and in-class final. His lectures are EXTREMELY boring and he goes the entire class time. Really nice guy though.

    Professor/Rabbi Edwards is a reasonable grader, a well versed professor in what he teaches, and is an all around enjoyable person to listen to. If you are remotely interested in the class, you will probably do well.

    Sweet, lovable guy! Rabbi Edwards is extremely caring and completely understanding towards his students. Easy class - but like the other rater said, lectures are extremely boring. Wish he would have added some experiential learning or activities to liven it up. All around great guy, though.

    Kind of hard not to get a good grade in this class: 6 quizzes, 3 2-3 pg, papers, and one final. Very lenient when it comes to grading and gives study guides. Extremely nice, but the class is a bit on the dull side (he just lectures). One of the easiest teachers.
