Get "Organic Chemistry for Dummies"; that book saved me during CHE 230. Tests are very difficult at first and conceptual test questions are too intense. LEARN HIS TESTING STYLE EARLY AND LOOK AT PRACTICE EXAMS! Funny, smart, sassy guy. Go to office hours. Falls behind and moves tests frequently. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2015<br>Class Name: CHE234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Vadola is an amazing professor. He's clearly very passionate and wants his students to learn. Exams are hard and he expects a lot but if you want to really learn orgo his class is the way to go. Plus he's hilarious and makes lecture actually enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2015<br>Class Name: CHE230234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Vadola has a clear passion for this class, therefore gives a very thorough lecture.

The averages most quarters are bimodal, so you either do really well or you fail. I believe it's more understanding how to take his very unique tests than the information, his tests are extremely hard. This class is hard so don't get a false impression from other reviews. Good luck. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: CHE232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Just read the book and do the work.
