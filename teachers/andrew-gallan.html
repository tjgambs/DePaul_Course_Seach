Warning though; six weeks of this course is dedicated heavily to LINKS, an online group marketing simulation. There's also no tests and he goes through all the homework assignments with you in class.  Never touched the textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>You want to learn marketing: Market is broken down into segments depicting a region, channel, and product. Marketing mix includes 4 P's Promotion, Product, Price, Place. The marketing mix is what you can change to attract customers. Now you know everything, so don't bother taking class.  DePaul should really hire me, I come with hair on my head too</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2014<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Andrew clearly is passionate about the material that he teaches.  He makes a lot of jokes during class, which seemed excessive at times to some students.  His grading scale is very tough (94 is an A-), but he is an easy grader.  There are 5 assignments and an ongoing group project, no exams.  Overall, I thought he was a good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2014<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Overall very good professor. He knows the subject matter very well. He also has a dry sense of humor which I think is great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2014<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Knows his stuff pretty well. Very dry sense of humor which I enjoyed very much.

He knows stuff. His sense of humor is bizarre. I learned about Marketing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2014<br>Class Name: MGT798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Service Design and Patient Experience with Dr. Gallan. He is very committed and his enthusiasm about the topic is very visible. The class was mostly live feeds from leaders in the field along with some lectures. If you are passionate about this topic, this is the course to take. This class made me change me concentration!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2014<br>Class Name: MKT798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Service Design and Patient Experience in the winter of 2014 and it was easily the best course I've taken at DePaul. The level of industry connections he provided our entire class was only trumped by his sincere desire to help us learn about PX. If you are a Health Sector Management concentration, you should DEFINITELY take this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>good professor - entertaining. powerpoint slides can be a bit mundane, but the writing exercises and simulation were interesting. easy grader. attend class and participate in group and should be no problem for an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Very sold professor with a strong sense of humor and marketing background. The simulation was tricky but it help you understand how companies work . There is no midterm or final just 3 small 1 page exercise, 1 individual report and 1 team report. In general take his class you won't get board  and you will learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Very interesting class. Professor provides with plenty real live examples, is a great speaker, funny. I really enjoyed the class. But it is not an easy A. Even though questions for three exams are provided in advance, exams are quite difficult. Grade also consists of strictly graded presentation and two write-up papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is one of the most brilliant professors at DePaul. Very clear, creative and nice professor. He is also funny and make very funny jokes during the class. You feel very comfortable with him. The only challenge with this class is that A is worth 96 points which means that you need to work hard with it. No exams; 3 HW + 3 case studies.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Professor! You will not regret taking him. Very clear on what he expects of you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gallan has three exams, which are pretty straight forward because he gives you the questions. He uses the book generated slides and skips over much of the PowerPoint slides. You have to learn a lot of the material on your own. Uses dry humor and wants the students attention a majority of the time. He also assigns a 10 minute group presentation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I have had the honor to learn from. An incredible speaker, amazing teacher. His teaching was very clear, fair three test, all the material is based on the topics that were cover in class. Professor Gallan is very educated and experienced on the topic. He tends to joke a lot which only enhances your positive feelingofclass</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! You can tell he definitely cares about his students, regardless of how interested they are in marketing. I wouldn't say it's an "easy-A" class, but if you work hard, it definitely possible. I definitely would recommend Gallan for marketing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2012<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, was able to get my attention in a Monday night class. Unless you are a slacker, you should not receive a grade lower than a B. Must put in work to get an A. Crystal clear what will be on exam and fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2012<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really good professor. Looked forward to going to all of his classes. He is funny and keeps your attention. I recommend you take him because his class was one of my favorite classes at DePaul so far. He is by no means easy, however. Sure, he gives you the questions before the exam, but they are difficult questions. Easy B/A-. Very hard A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2012<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. He integrates many different things into class(lecture, videos, group activities). 3 exams, 1 group presentation, 2 HW assignments and he literally GIVES you the exam questions beforehand. Smart man, relevant real world examples. And he is funny. Among one of the best professors I've taken at DePaul. Easy A. Take him!</div></div></div></body></html>
