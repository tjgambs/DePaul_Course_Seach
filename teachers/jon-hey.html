Easiest A you can get. Lectures are incredibly boring and quizzes have nothing to do with the lectures, but are still incredibly easy. Quizzes are open notes. You can get away with missing all the lecture days if you wanted and still get an A in the class. Big research paper for the final but its not too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2013<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this class with him if you just want to knock out your history requirement, because I don't think many people in this class take him seriously since he can be very dull about the lecture. He's a nice and helpful professor, but he speaks in monotone every class there's a lecture. Not very enthusiastic, but game days are mildly interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2013<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely helpful and patient.
