It may seem boring but if you focus on writing and participating in class, you'll be fine. She is a very nice and caring person. If you ask for help and advice, she is always willing to work with students. She listens to feedback and good at constructive criticism </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2015<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>In the Erica Jong focal point, we read a lot of her poems and a few of her novels that were essential to the participation. Durnell is very nice and caring, and she wants you to do well. Assignments are straightforward. She will stay quiet and wait for you to participate so you might as well talk in class. Had a lot of good discussions in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Only a couple of long papers are assigned throughout the course and the rest is reading a few assignments posted on D2L and your digication portfolio. Durnell gives great feedback on papers and that usually bumps up your grade on said assignment if you make said adjustments. She's not energetic or "funny" but has a kind nature that makes up for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Durnell is overall a great teacher. Grade is composed of several short written responses to readings and one argumentative paper. In addition to this there are bi-weekly reflections. She gives feedback on everything written and tells you exactly what you need to work on. Overall great experience. Dont buy the textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2014<br>Class Name: 104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enjoyed the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Love Laura Durnell. She is a very easy grader and gives amazing positive feedback that really is an ego boost. She is very awkward, but its adorable. She just is unclear at times, but always responds to email. Take the class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Durnell is a very nice lady and will grade your assignments easily (watch our for comma placement though).  She can just be a little unclear sometimes, but I enjoyed her as my WRD professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you don't get an A in Professor Durnell's class it's your own damn fault.

Although she assigns a lot of writing assignments, she grades pretty easily and gives great feedback. She's very personable and fun in class. I would absolutely recommend taking her class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103122<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very specific with her feedback when you turn in papers for her to edit. She is very nice, but class is A LOT of work. A lot of papers and reflections. She is also kind of awkward in her teaching. If you're looking for a chill WRD class, this is a mix of hard work but chill when class meets.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very awkward. She takes points off for everything and is not really fair. Assigns two to three papers a week plus a 10 page final research paper and a final. Attendance is mandatory. Is SUPER unclear, no one ever knows what is due. She talks a lot about topics that aren't even related to the class. DO NOT TAKE HER.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>From: &quot;The Honest Reviewer&quot; - Professor L. Durnell was a professor that was willing to help. She assigned assignments that required a fair amount of time to complete. She is was good in almost every way. The only cons she possesses is that she is very awkward when she talks, thus causing small moments of silence in class. Overall, 9.5/10. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2009<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most useful class I had so far at DePaul!!!

Just do the work and you're fine.  Tended to ramble, but not a bad professor.  Only problem is that she couldn't spell. . .</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers at DePaul.  She could not be nicer.  Always willing to help, give you a feedback, and guide you the right way.  I would strongly recommend her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>as an english major.. the only prof that has improved my writing. unlike a lot of english teachers, it's not all her way or the highway... you can do things your way, but if they suck she'll let you know. i got an a with a fair amount of work, but my writing in that class is some of my best so far. oh, and she's nice and quirky.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her for a night class, she always gave long breaks and let us out early. She knows her stuff but isn't one of those English teachers who limits your creativity. My writing has improved drastically- she tells you exactly what you're doing wrong. She is a little jittery, but it's not a problem.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2007<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So Prof Durnell, what to say...she is pretty awesome, laid back and chilled. She is understanding and what not. All you have to do is not be lazy and hand in stuff when it is due. Yep, that is it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2007<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor, very helpful and clear.

A decent amount of time is required to get a good grade, but totally worth it b/c I learned so much.  I highly recommend this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RETURN YOUR ST. MARTENS HANDBOOK, BORROW THY NEIGHBORS!!! Second, I took her first semester, IM IN LOVE!!! She makes this class so much easier than it's supposed to be, she's very relaxed, if you piss her off, something is wrong with your personality, go kill yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not recommend.  She is not an easy teacher, anymore.  Not helpful at all and takes off letter grades for simple mistakes on papers.  She has no confidence at all.  Very boring and useless teacher, and her grading scale is unclear and she does not follow it at all.  She will constantly change the grading policy. Stay away unless you want to </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is way to hard of a grader.  In my opinion I am a good write and have always gotten A's in english but she just makes you feel like you don't know a thing about writing.  Acts or is really nice in class but has no problem giving you a bad grade even if you are trying hard.  She expected our papers to be superior quality yet she never taught.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible!!! I took this class because this site said she was easy, but she changed! She's the hardest grader in the entire world and class is so boring. All she talks about is politics when there are so many different topics we could cover in 104. There's a lot of work so be prepared to work your butt off!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate this teacher. Her grading scales are ridiculous along with her assignments. I never have had problems with teachers before but she is absolutely awful. Don't take class with her unless you want to be bored to tears and stressed out about your grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Before I even decided I want to take another English class as a requirement my first thought was here's another one of those boring classes coming up.  Boy was I wrong about this class.  Luara made this class so much fun and the students in the class was great.  In fact this class was better then some of my other classes.  I recommend her to anyone</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was an awesome teacher who was more than willing to help out her students. She was an easier grader and really nice. She actually made English enjoyable, if that's possible. I would highly recommend her to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher.

Prof. Durnell is very approachable and willing to help.  If you do what you are supposed to do, ask the questions you have and put forth the effort, you'll do fine in her class.

Fair, but not easy. If you are willing to work she is great. If you are lazy....don't bother. She will only give a pop quiz if the class won't shut up, or is not prepared to participate...or does not read. My best teacher EVER. Take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class & professor is really all about &quot;what you put into is what you get&quot;. I figured why not try to get the best out of this class. I managed to learn so much, and now I am a much better writer. Really try to understand what makes a good paper. She loves people who are interested.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BOORING! She is a nice person and all, but too bland. She will try to help you but she has no self confidence. She can get out of hand sometimes...POP QUIZ! I tried switching out of her class three times but all others were full. BEWARE!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2004<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very nice person, and always want to help you.

The hour segments go by relatively quick. The essays that she assigns are open ended so writing them isnt a chore. All in all her class IS an elective b/c we need ENG 103 and 104. I feel like they placed us in the idiot class. But an A is an A and I wont whine about that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>her classes are a wast of time.  when i leave each day i think that i just became stupider. it is an easy class to pass i don't recomend her at all but not the worst you can have</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, she may seem a little wierd at first but she knows her stuff.
