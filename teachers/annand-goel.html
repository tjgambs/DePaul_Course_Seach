Do not make this mistake; you'll be more confused in your future endeavors; creating probable long term failure.

Is organized on his end, but does not consider his method of teaching results in a higher probability of failure. I dont understand why DPU would keep promoting him to additional subjects of concentration.

If you are not a finance major; I would suggest taking someone else. His curves are huge for tests but they are pretty difficult. Often goes off topic, can be quite unorganized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really not that bad. Maybe it's a bit too much if you're not interested in finance and not a finance major, those are the only people that complained in my class. He also applies a nice curve at the end, he's really not bad!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2008<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not that bad.

Kind of ironic that he tries to get rid of you when you go see him. Does encourage you to email though.  I would rather take Berry, but if Berry is full, hes okay (not like you have an option anymore)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives really good study guides and examples for the mid-term and final, but they are pretty hard.  The problem sets help a lot too.  Class average is usually low but it all ends up working out at the end.  Good amount of A's, B's and C's, and of course D's and F's.  Like others have been saying though, heâ€™s young with not much real world experie</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is helpful and encourages people to email him if there are any questions, which you will have because finance is a pain.  He tries to make it interesting, but when you meet him, he will always try to rush through.  He definitely knows his stuff, but no real world experience. Midterm avg was a 54.  But if you get some of it, you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2007<br>Class Name: FIN311H<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy, but does not prepare you for what's on the exams. The material is tough to begin with and his lectures are not very useful. It is possible to get an A in the class, but you have to devote a lot of time to it. Although, He's a nice guy and you can always go to him for help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2007<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I feel bad for him: he tries so hard, but still sucks horribly at teaching. Boring 3-hour power-point lectures. Does not go over his extensive problem sets. Very theoretical. Has NO REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE (huge minus and it shows)--&gt;BS to MBA to Ph.D with no corporate experience. Why is he teaching Honors Finance&#63; Nice guy, but he should not teach!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible!!! this professor does NOT know how to teach. talks very monotone. hard to understand.  Midterm average in class was 48%. I would never take his class again - if u can avoid taking him as a finance teacher.  explains material to fast - u don't even have time to ask him a &#63;. exams are really hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2006<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible. Just terrible. I am so mad that I'm paying all this money to be taught by such an incompetent professor.  He knows his stuff but cannot TEACH it.  His exams are impossible but there is a big curve.  Instead of the curve, he should make the exams reasonable so that the midterm average is not a 58%.  Oh, and the group project sucks!Beware!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2006<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2005<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not that bad. I wouldnt waste your time buying the book, he gives you fairly good handouts for notes.  Also he gives you a practice midterm and final. The group project really does suck, but if you go to class every day and do well on the problem sets then you should get atleast a B. HUGE CURVE at END!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2005<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In brief, bad @ teaching, group project sucked...he doesnt exactly tell u everything or he is askin a lot for a project, however i expected to get a C/D in the class but with the curve i got an unexpected B...i bombed the midterm but did well on the final, expect to teach urself from his handouts...note: i didnt use a book</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is ten times better than Houston. The only problem is he has this project where he is very unclear on what he wants.  His midterm was easy but watch out for the final.  It is hard as hell.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Flys through topics to get everything done before class ends.

The midterm is easy but his final is extremely difficult.  He isn't clear on what he wants from the group project.  He does curve.  After we received our midterm scores he gave us a weighted average of our up to the point grades and a 75% was an A.  A C was like a 50%, so that tells you his class is difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2005<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Compare and Contrast Goel and Houston: Houston: He is straight forward, his hand writing sucks, you have to be able to read his messy notes on the board, you  need to listen in class, and invest a lot of time in home work. Goel: He is not easy to understand, he is bit complicated, homework is easy because u can work with groups and grade is divid</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2005<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very difficult, but he will help you and he will grade on a curve.

It seems like he puts a lot of effort into the class, but at the same time makes it challenging.  At least the greade does not consist mainly on 2 grades.
