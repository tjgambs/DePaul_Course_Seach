She'll try hard to improve your writing.  Knows a LOT about authors' histories, criticism, and editing.  Only complaint: oftentimes too much a structuralist/feminist critic for her own good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2004<br>Class Name: ENG207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i like her.  she has a good sense of humor and she's brilliant.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2003<br>Class Name: ENG270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very helpful and funny. learned a lot.</div></div></div></body></html>
