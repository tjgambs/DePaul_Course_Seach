    Nice guy who knows what hes talking about. The projects aren't too hard and you can do them with a partner. He gives a study guide for midterm and  final that are really helpful BUT they don't cover everything that will be on the tests. The tests are challenging and are mostly short answer with about 10 mc

    Please stay away from this teacher. My advisor suggested me to take this class and bad decision! He's like the worst teacher I've ever had in my life. Ridiculous hard midterm and he doesn't teach you anything related to this class. Avoid if you can!

    i thought this was his first yr teaching because he was so bad it but apparently not. he absolutely doesnt teach u anything. if u are willing to read word to word from every chapter &amp; study on ur own u will pass. he doesnt care about late assignments or attendance. avoid if u wanna learn, take him if u wanna study on ur own and get a fairly easy A

    He is the worst teacher I have ever had at Depaul. He thinks he is the man when really all he dreams about his having friends one day. Avoid at all cost.

    Very unclear. New professor, so he is obviously not used to teaching. Class has nothing to do with the book or exams. Tests are totally unrelated and unclear. Very unclear about what he expects for the project. STAY AWAY! His class needs to be audited by the directos of the Dept. A real jerk! There needs to be more aprofessors who teach this class.

    REALLY CONFUSING. I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN TAKING THE CLASS BUT HE NEVER KEEPS ANYBODY INTERESTED. HE TALKS VERY SLOWLY AND ASKS QUESTIONS AND WAITS UNTIL SOMEBODY ANSWERS EVEN IF IT TAKES FOREVER FOR SOMEONE TO ANSWER! HE DOESNT EXPLAIN ANY OF THE PROJECTS THROUGHLY ENOUGH TO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND. VERY CONFUSING.

    If you read the book &amp; do what he suggests, you'll get a good grade.  He's very willing to answer any questions &amp; help you in any way.  He doesn't spoon feed his students.  Instead he challenges you to think.  He's also a very fair grader on exams &amp; projects and takes into consideration your overall effort.

    Very unclear as to what he expects. Basically doesnt really give guidelines for how to study. Tough tests. A project that he is very vague on. Final is cumulative.

    Most of the time I wasn't really sure what we were supposed to be learning. We had to read a bunch of cases. Then, we had to analyze them without being taught anything about the underlying principals. When discussing the cases everyone sat around and tried to guess at the answers. Usually the discussion resulted in little, if any, gain of knowledge

    Tests are not very clear.  It was a mystery as to what we should study.  He collects homework, which is lame; it takes up a lot of time, and mostly just involves copying definitions from the book.  Problems are easy, mostly just TV- and stuff like that.

    He takes the word &quot;unclear&quot; to a whole new level!! When asking him questions, it seems that you and he are speaking 2 different languages.
