He tells you the stuff that will be on the tests but you basically have to teach yourself. Tests are easy you just have to read the chapters and do the homework! He takes test questions straight from the book-he even tells you he does. Your grade is based on the 3 tests you take. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2015<br>Class Name: ECON314<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice and smart guy.  Exams are fairly easy.  One paper on a Chicago topic of your choice.  Lectures are beyond boring.  He just reads off the powerpoints and shows videos.  Notes are poorly organized and material is covered extremely fast.  Doesn't seem like he really cares if you learn or not.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2014<br>Class Name: ECON360<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>One word- boring. Extremely boring. He just reads powerpoint slides. BUT it is a pretty easy class. Just pay attention, or at least try to, especially when he draws graphs and does math problems. The tests aren't too bad, but you will have to explain some things in written form, so just memorize the powerpoint slides. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2014<br>Class Name: ECO312<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>His lecture are boring but pay attention when he draws graphs & math problems. 3 exams, and 1 group or individual presentation.

However, if you do the readings and study his powerpoint slides, you'll  be just fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2012<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so boring!!

He's also extremely kind, and his ringtone is Katy Perry! Only thing is, his actual lectures can be extremely boring. Just read the powerpoints and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2011<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is smart guy, published author, knows his stuff. Not the clearest speaker or most detail-oriented guy but he has a good heart and i thought his humor was funny too! &quot;Ok the exam ends at 10:30 cuz thats when my meter is up&quot; I did the readings so yes, i did learn.

I got a C+ in the class, but put minimal effort.  Go to the SI sesions to get the old tests, lots of questions are just copied from them.  DOnt read the book, just study from the power points</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, albeit a bit boring. There were way too many handouts, which I doubt a lot of people read, as it was never checked. Papers are a joke: I did not feel challenged at all ... which made it hard to take the class seriously. Take him because he's very nice, but if it is a morning class, bring coffee ... LOTS AND LOTS OF COFFEE ...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The ISP was Explore Chicago.  He was very passionate and well versed in the subject.  Although his voice sort of lulls the students to sleep, when paying attention, his passion about the topics comes out and makes the topics more interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was so boring. The book is more interesting than him. The test are easy (multiple choice with some problems) and on all the material he covered in class including the problems he assigned. There are three tests the entire quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.

I got a good grade without EVER reading, studying or doing any of the homework problems, but I did take the class in high school.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, all he does is read off the book and when he goes over the homework he gives the answers and lets you figure out the rest on your own. going to class is completely useless especially at 830 am. its not too hard of a subject but you'll be on your own</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: ECON360<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice guy, a little boring but overall a great professor. just show up to class and stay awake. you will learn a thing or two in this class. material is easy if you show up. he is more than willing to explain things in his office at any time. great teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2005<br>Class Name: ECON360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting subject. He brought in alot of other ways of teaching; videos, guest speakers and articles. Very nice teacher, some found him a little dry, that may be true but that didn't give me a problem. He is often in his office, loves to talk development econ. I would recomend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SOOO BORING.  But I have heard horror stories about micro classes and his tests are not unpredictable.  He goes by the book.  Two tests and a final.  Final was the easiest test for our class. But just a warning that he is incredibly boring. What econ teacher isn't though&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2005<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall he is a good professor. All you have to do is do the reading (which is easy) and show up to take the tests. He tends to confuse you with his lectures but the subject itself is not difficult. He doesn't count attendance and curves every test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2004<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is definitely difficult to understand. Does not explain, your better off reading the material on your own.It seems as if sometimes he gets himself confused. There are 3 tests & they all have the same weight on your grade. Make sure u understand the problems he does in class.. they're on the tests</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: ECON<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class.  I'm not even sure if it is college level.

He gives review sheets for tests, and they really help. Grade is determined by 2 tests and a final. Helpful outside of class as well. Overall, nice teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2004<br>Class Name: PPS359<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Learned so much about the Chicago economy (that was the class title).
