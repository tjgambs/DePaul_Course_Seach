No point in attending class outside of presentations/tests although he did check attendance one day. Everything you need to know is o the powerpoint and all he does is read it off in class anyways.

The tests aren't hard at all if you just study his PowerPoints (he posts them on D2L). He also grades the essay questions, presentations, and problem sets very leniently, so if you have any idea what you're doing he'll probably give you full credit. The class isn't exciting but he's a nice guy and I did learn some stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Despite the dry nature of the course, he makes classes go by like a breeze.

He basically reads off power points, which can get boring. Theres 2 easy projects, 2 group presentations, midterm and final. The tests are, for the most part, based on the power points so the book is pointless. Very easy to get a good grade in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2012<br>Class Name: MIS140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a good professor.

If a class is going to be this pointless, we should not be required to take it.  Learned nothing, lost $2,000. Don't buy the book. Read the notes once and congrats, you've got yourself an A.

Anyway, the class is an easy A. The professor is very nice and always willing to help.

But overall this class was very easy.  He tells you what is on the midterm and final.  Speak up a few times in class and you will be fine for class participation points.
