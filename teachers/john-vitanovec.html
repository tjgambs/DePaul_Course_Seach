He explains things clearly and he's always ready to help. Do his homework, it's online, very easy. 2 exams, a little tough, but not undoable. Challenges you to rise to your potential. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2014<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Professor ever. I enjoyed his teaching style, he tried his best to make you understand the subject. he was always available & he replies to our email quickly. very cooperative & just listen to his lecture, take down notes & you will be fine.  I wish if he could teaches us the other accounting classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101H<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Vitanovec is THE man. Walking into an accounting class, I wasn't really expecting it to be entertaining in any way. He turned out to be one of the best professors I've had throughout my freshman year at DePaul. Do your homework, pay attention and you should be prepared for his exams. I recommend him to everyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice teacher except for when it comes to problems with grading. The online homework site "cengage" will screw up your answers and he will not care to fix your grade even if you show proof. He really doesn't care about his students or how hard they're trying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He sure was interested in accounting, but unfortunately not very interested in understanding your problems. He gives you a syllabus and if you miss an assignment for a legitimate reason he doesn't care. He'll simply reply "sorry, the syllabus says if you miss it you're stuck with a 0". So he's kind of uncaring. Not terrible but not great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Was a great teacher, always kept the class interesting and made it relatable to us. Was very animated even when just talking about numbers! And always willing to help! Showed he cared about his students!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best. He makes accounting very fun to learn! However he talks and moves quickly in his lectures. Doing the readings before class will definitely help!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Vitanovec comes off as a complete ass sometimes (he thought I had an IQ below 100 and treated me like a child whenever I talked to him), but he is generally a funny guy. Decent lectures, not wiling to help that much, but will adequately prepare you for his tests. Studying is required.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Vitanovec is an awesome guy and an equally awesome teacher.  Take his class, you won't regret it.  From the get-go, it is easy to tell why this guy made so much money in his prime.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED VITANOVEC! He was awesome and caring and probably one of the best teachers i've ever had. Highly recommend him. Even though i didnt do well in accounting, i would take him again in a heartbeat.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: ACCH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite professor so far. He is very engaging. The midterm and final are not too hard. If you try and do the work, you'll probably get an a or a b.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far one of the best professors I've ever had. He's very enthusiastic, which is extremely helpful in something dull like accounting. His handouts really help you understand; no other ACC professors give handouts like his. He loves when people ask questions and is knowledgeable &patient. He's friendly, approachable, &willing to help with anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an extremely helpful professor. He doesn't take attendance, but I highly recommend attending all classes. Accounting is definitely a subject that you must work hard in and practice in order to grasp concepts. All handouts were extremely helpful, and he would tell us what problems to focus on within each chapter in order to prepare. TAKE HIM !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2013<br>Class Name: ACC101H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT professor. Super helpful. Likes you if you pay attention and know the answers when called upon. Getting a good grade is easy as long as you do the hw and pay attention in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2012<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Made the class easy and explained everything in great detail.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2012<br>Class Name: ACC101H<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher but a bit tough whenever students talk too much. Still, great teacher. Study because this class isn't easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/05/2012<br>Class Name: ACC101H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken 3 acc classes and I still enjoyed his the best.  One of the most clear and straightforward teachers I've had at DePaul.  Would always make great analogies that would help you study. Very easy class to sit through Quizzes and tests were nothing out of the ordinary but you still had to look at the chapter to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/24/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite professor. Very funny, relateable, and knows his stuff. It was a bit of a more difficult class but he made it as easy as possible. I would recommend him to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really good professor. He knows what he is talking about and, from what I hear about the other 101 Strobel professor, he seems to give a lot less work. This class is not the easist and requires a large amount of time devoted to studying for the final and midterm; but, you will learn a lot and find out if Accounting is right for you or not.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly hilarious! Mid term and final exam are really easy, and final exam is non-cumulative. Do the homework, take notes in class, don't fall asleep and you'll do fine. If you need extra help, the professor will gladly answer your questions during class and find time afterwards too. If you're in Strobel's, take him. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NOT my major--had to take this for Study Abroad--but learned a lot, and he helped me personally.  TAs absolutely suck (SUCK -- not fair, COM) but Vitanovec is interesting and has good stories.  And he really roots for his students.  Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Vitanovec is a very clear, organized and knowledgable instructor. He is one of the few teachers that know how to explain accouting. I say this bc I took this class once before.  Definitely study for the midterm and final because there is alot of content and problems. This teacher also likes you to ask questions , so dont be shy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Vitanovec is great. While I only got a C+ in the class, that wasn't his fault. If you take this class, especially if you're in Strobel, you need to manage your time wisely. He's extremely clear when he explains things, and when he senses that some students aren't 100% clear, he explains it again. Very fair teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2011<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>accounting is hard no matter who you take it with.....vitanovec is an excellent teacher and will make sure u get the material. highly recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Vitanovec brings decades of experience to the classroom. Formerly employed by PricewaterhouseCoopers and at one point the CFO of WGN, Vitanovec is an expert in the field of business (not just accounting) and it truly shows during his lectures. The midterm and final are relatively easy but if you don't pace yourself, you won't finish. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for Strobel Honors 101.  He's a really nice guy, he's only teaching for the fun of it.  It's only his second year at DePaul- before he had a big possition at WGN. Basically, he's loaded. He always will stay after class to answer questions if you have any.  He likes to randomly call on people to answer questions, all homework online.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and guy. He is there to help you learn. The mid and final were not tough if you study and understand material. He gives plenty of handouts and questions to help you. When I asked him why his mid term was so easy he responded, &quot;I'm not here to fail anyone, I want to make sure everyone knows the stuff to get them into Acct 102&quot; Awesome</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is new but he is soo awesome. I absolutely love his class and i wished he taught 102. He explains it very well and in a fun way. You will not fall asleep in his class. he gives plenty of handouts and real world problems to help u understand.  I recommend anyone who needs this class to take it wit him. Btw he quotes the hangover. which is so funn</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him this past fall quarter and yes he's a brand new teacher.  I agree with the other post that he EXTREMELY helpful and really cares about making sure you know the concepts.  I did not find his lectures confusing at all. Homework is not mandatory, but if you do the it prior to class you will understand everything.  Take him, he was awesome!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had JV fall quarter this year. He's brand new and he hasn't really figured out his teaching style yet. Even though his lectures are confusing he is the NICEST man on the planet! He is always willing to help his students out! Also, if you're having trouble in the class but you're trying your hardest and show it! JV will notice that! NICEST MAN EVR</div></div></div></body></html>
