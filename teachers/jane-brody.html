    One of the most talented teachers. Will force you to change, challenge you, frustrate you and drive you absolutely crazy until you realize how much she has made you improve. Really a beautiful person, although she can be tough on people, you just have to be willing to rise to the occasion.

    She is a cool lady and knows what she's talking about, but can be sassy and dismissive outside of class. I was comfortable with her at first, but when she continuously dismissed my concerns I found it very hard to approach her.
