The presentations require lots of team collaboration and public speaking. The mid-term is all about application of principles and the final comes right off of a 150 slide presentation.  Both are LONG! The bottom line is I learned a lot, worked hard, and got the A I deserved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OKay, there are no + or - in this class, so its A B C OR D. Wich can be unfair especially when i handed in the 1800 word paper and recieved a B while other never handed in the paper and still recieved a B. He's unfair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. there is alot of work to be done, but i received a solid A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2004<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shows extreme favortism, but not necessarily to the best students - hard to say what he is basing it on. Weird guy. Made the longest midterm ever and final was over 20 pages long with qestions requiring knowing the slides pretty much by heart. AVOID HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like multiple time consuming presentations, writing mid-terms for 3hours and 15min straight - then take him, if not stay away from him!</div></div></div></body></html>
