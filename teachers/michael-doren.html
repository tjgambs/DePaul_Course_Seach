    I personally think that Prof Doren is one of the best professors. He gives too much hw but the points you get for those assignments help you to get a better grade if you try well enough. His tests are long but most of the problems are from hw assignments. I would recommend him to the future students.

    Prof Doren is an interesting man, that being said he is probebly the most helpful/caring professors in academia.  Do not sluf off on homework, there is way too much to get behind. His tests are serious business, but not impossible, and he is always there to lend a helping hand. I highly recomend him to future DePaul students.

    I personally do not like his class. I found his class to be extremely easy and very boring. Do not take this class if you have already taken calculus before. He gives a lot of homework!!! His directions are confusing. He's a nice man though.

    Prof Doren is such a nice old man. He really cares about his students &amp; tries his hardest to give you a good grade. Hw is a MUST-- he does assign a lot but it really helps you in the end. even counts on tests (if it is to your benefit) Lots of extra credit opportunities. I loved him &amp; got an A...worked hard tho. No quizzes. 3 tests plus final.

    Good teacher...At first, I was worried because he assigns a lot of homework and writes out all the assignments by hand. But then I realized how lucky I was to have signed up for him.

    Probably the worst and most ignorant teacher I have ever had in my life. He is extremely arrogant and will not help you when you ask for it. On my homework instead of offering help he put &quot;why are you still enrolled in this class&#63;&quot; Be prepared to do a ton of homework that is GRADED on top of hard tests. Good luck.

    prof. doren is an amazing teacher. he is so cute and super helpful. he teaches so that every one knows whats happening and gives numerous oppurtunities throughout the quarter for tons of extra credit. he really goes the extra mile to know that everyone understands the material. its an easy class if you do the homework and study for exams.

    Prof Doren is a great teacher (&amp; funny!). Whatever you need from him, he will be at your service. Sends lots of emails, watch your inbox for extra-credit. Assigns homework every night but that is expected in Math class. Do the homework and you will be cool for the Exams, in which there are only 3

    What a nice guy! His class was hard work but do your homework and you're set. You can email him with questions and he always responds very quickly. He is partly retired so he only teaches a few classes...BUT YOU SHOULD TRY TO GET IN ONE OF THEM!  I got an A in the class and I never could have with out him!

    One of the best math teachers at DePaul, but you have to work for a good grade. There is A LOT of hw, but he takes you step-by-step and you can email him with any questions. Tests are not bad, but study. He wants you to understand the material, not just memorize formulas

    Sweetest little old man ever. You can tell he loves math and tries to get his students to understand it. He's a fun teacher who does assign a lot of hw but most math profs do. Allows test retakes and E.C. and for the most part his test are based off hw probs. Take him for any math classes!

    Explains things very nicely. Expect a lot of homework. Shoot yourself when it comes to an exam, people stay up to an HOUR after the test to finish it. everything you learn in class IS NOT ON THE TEST!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! I passed his class with a C and I had to pray for a miricale for that.

    HE WAS THE BEST TEACHER I HAD THIS QUARTER. THERE IS HOMEWORK EVERYDAY BUT HE IS MORE THAN WELCOME TO HELP YOU THROUGH IT. SEND HIM AN E-MAIL AND HE WILL GET RIGHT BACK TO YOU WITH AN ANSWER. HE GIVES LOTS OF EC AND TESTS ARE NOT THAT BAD. WHATEVER YOU GET WRONG YOU ARE ABLE TO CORRECT FOR A PORTION OF THE POINTS. TAKE HIM HES AWESOME!

    He is a very nice guy and I think all the comments on him are very accurate. Read your emails! (he loves to send them)  Overall, he won't go over too much of the homework so be sure to bring problems up in class.  He gives a lot of homework, but as long as you turn it in you'll be fine.  Test grade averages with homework and extra credit(advantage!

    Prof. Doren cares a lot about his students and gives people so many breaks--almost too many. Isn't concise on assignments, lectures, or tests...sometimes makes things more complicated and wordy. I don't see how you could not get an A from him.

    So the class is easy until you get to the test. His tests are impossible because they're not written like any homework questions from the book. When I went in for help, after getting 100%s on all my homework and D's and F's on the tests, he got all offended and tried to make me feel stupid and told me that I should withdraw from his class.

    Prof. Doren is very helpful, he is willing to take his time to help you to understand either the homework or any of the material that he went over. Also he does give out a lot of extra credit, and can use a cheat sheet for the final. I would take him for all of your math classes.

    Amazing professor!  You really need to attend class and keep up with your homework (which is a fair amount) but if you do, you will do really well in his class.  He is a great guy and wants students to do well in his class, so he grades in your favor.

    Be prepared to work hard, and you must attend all the classes.  If you do so, you'll learn more about math than you ever thought you could, and you'll enjoy it.  Great patience if you're trying to learn; little sympathy if you're lazy.

    Professor Doren is a great teacher. He is able to teach math in a way that you will remember and understand. His tests are not hard, also considering that you get to use a cheat sheet. He is there to help you whenever you need him.

    He seems as if he is a nice guy, but he really isnt. The homework that you slave to do does not really count. The midterm and final are the determining factors of your grade, and if you mess up on that he will fail you.
