    Very easy and interesting class. The notes in class follow exactly what you read in the book. He almost gives you the whole test through notes. He gets of subject sometimes but is a very nice and knowledgeable guy.

He is one of those theacher who knows so much and he has been aorund for awhile it's hard to show up to class and not listen to him! There was a midterm and a final, book report, and 3 response papers... easy class... take this prof!!

    Leeks is great. He is an easy grader. His lectures are pretty boring, but they go along with the book. There are 3 two page essays and a book report, but they aren't bad at all. I don't recommend taking him early in the morning. He has a deep voice that will lull you to sleep. Very knowlageble, but has a tendancy to go off on tangants.

    Prof Leeks is a good professor and knows a lot about politics and politicial history. He grades pretty easy. His lectures can be corresponded with the book. You have to write 3 essays, a book report, the mid-term and final are your basic grades. He likes participation. Easy grader. I recommend that you take his class, yo will get a lot from it.

    Leeks demonstrates his knowledge. Could be more enthusiastic. Weekly papers which you post on blackboard. They're a pain, but you learn the material. PARTICIPATE. Kinda demanding with readings. He doesnt respond to emails. Hard to get in touch with. Not as hard as it sounds.

    HA! the first &quot;A&quot; i ever got in a PSC class, i think he was just not interested b/c our book came in a good three weeks b/4 the end of the quarter.  He was not hard at all i went to an average 1 class a week and still got an &quot;A.&quot;  Perhaps i cayght him in a strange moment.

    Prof. Leeks is a great professor and really supports his students if you are involved in his class. Participate and he'll give you a good grade because he'll remember you. Weekly papers are a must, but they aren't hard at all.

    i didn't think his essay exams were hard.  the weekly paper were tedious, to be sure, but i have to admit, they helped me learn the material.  those who think he's a hard professor are probably just lazy slackers looking for a blow-off class.

    He is by far the worst teacher that I have ever had at DePaul.  He is very smart in political science, but he doesn't use political science as his method of speaking.  he is boring, and he grades his essays hard.  He also favors certain brown nosers.

    He is very opinionated and doesn't really like to hear others' points of view.  Suck it up and try and participate in the class because he won't really like you if you don't.  He also likes to select his favorites, and them only.

    This class was hard, especially if you are a first year.  He makes you do essays every week on a topic from the book and then you have to relate them to a newspaper article.  His tests are all essay, and he grades hard on them.
