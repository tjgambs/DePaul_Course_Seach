All the "scripting" you learn he calls bad programming. Nice enough guy, but no grades were entered before our final grade was uploaded to campus connect, there was no clear vision of what he was expecting for our final project, and the final project was worth 65% of the final grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2014<br>Class Name: GAM340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: F</div><div id="right"><div>Worst class i've ever taken at DePaul. THERE WAS NO SYLLABUS, he made up the course as he was going along. He'd fail to fix hardly any of the problems we'd encounter with Unity since he's not a programmer himself. Finally, nothing we did in the class was graded excluding the final. You know a professor is at fault when he fails half the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2014<br>Class Name: GAM331<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: F</div><div id="right"><div>This guy cannot teach for anything he taught a class about programmming when he is not a programmer himself. He didn't even know how to explain the code he put on the board sometimes he just say copy it down and that's how we basically "learned" half of the class failed because he just wasn't clear in what he was teaching please don't take him.</div></div></div></body></html>
