He's passionate and his lectures won't put you to sleep. It helps to do the readings. His tests aren't insane and the study guides are super helpful. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2014<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Zilis honestly one of the professors i've taken. He is fair and makes you work for it but you will learn so much from him. More than that you'll want to learn from him. Participation is key with him, you have to go to basically very class, but it's worth it. Seriously, take him you won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2014<br>Class Name: PSC260<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Zilis was a great teacher.  His class was never boring.  He engages students during class. Grade was composed of participation, 2 papers, midterm, and final.  The midterm was not hard.  There is reading, but not too much.  He really knows his stuff and is one of my favorite teachers. He is so nice, take him. </div></div></div></body></html>
