He's hilarious, keeps you interested. Exams are easy, and assignments are easy as well and you get a week for each assignment. One of my favorite teachers so far. He's very understanding and helpful. Three words: hip, cool, and laid back. (But not too laid back) Take him! He'll be the best thing during your trimester.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2008<br>Class Name: PSY218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy.

He is really laidback and cool. He is sort of soft spoken but very witty. He does not require attendance, and his tests are very straight forward. He posts all of his lectures on powerpoints on Blackboard so his tests are easy to study for, and if you miss anything its all online</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2008<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE HIM! myfavorite teacher at depaul so far. he is really funny and makes everythign interesting. he is really easy, you take 3 tests throughout the quarter and he only takes the highest 2. no final! you just have to do these study things but they are really easy. i would def. take one of his classes again and recommend him to everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2007<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such an awesome teacher!  I had him at 8:30 in the morning and always remained interested because of his entertaining/helpful activities and positive attitude.  Everything was clearly explained and easy to understand, he even makes power points fun! Study before the test and take notes(duh!) and you're golden! Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2007<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a FANTASTIC teacher. Not only does he clarify all of the subject matter, but he does it in a way that makes you actually want to show up to an 8:30 non-attendance-taking class. He's hilarious and I would recommend him to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2007<br>Class Name: PSY101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such an amazing teacher; anyone who doesn't take this class is at a loss.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Behling is a great teacher and makes the class really interesting.
