Take his poetry class! He is more interested in making artists than test takers, his words exactly, and he made poetry really enjoyable and accessible. Definitely recommend him and would take him again. Funny, helpful, and very very nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2013<br>Class Name: ENG509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great instructor!!  I took him for the course that was required in accompaniment to my internship. Prof Green is very attentive--he responds to all of your comments or questions.  I learned a ton from a course that I didn't expect to produce anything but drudge work.  A great instructor and a great guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2012<br>Class Name: ENG219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely recommended! As long as you do the assignments, you should receive an A. He wears a lot of cardigans and actually tries to get the class to know each other which makes for a more fun class. There's a bit of reading sometimes but it's not too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: ENG219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am not an english major, but I was always interested in poetry. I jumped the chance and took it with professor Green. Needless to say I am now forever hooked with poetry and plan to send some of my stuff to some poetry magazines. Thanks to him I am forever inspired.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed taking a class with Prof. Green.
