    Since it was a Science and Nature Writing class, we were able to take a lot of field trips around Chicago's best museums and nature exhibits like the Shedd, Field, Planetarium, etc. so that was fun. With each day we would have to write a scientific review and also more assigned papers throughout the quarter. Lots of fun, but lots of writing as well

    Anton was very helpful and very respectful of everyone's work. I loved our class workshops and he always made sure to point out both the things that needed improvement and the things that were well done. He was firm about doing the readings and class participation.

    One of the biggest hacks at DePaul he blatantly plays favorites. He is very passive-agressive and has no strength of character, an effeminate bourgesois characteristic of the Illinois northsore, he does not teach but rather perpetuates his own narcissism. A true coward he will hold it against you if you write something he doesn't agree with.

    If only I had a time machine.  Anton is terrible.  He seems friendly and approachable, but he is way too demanding and overly sensitive.  If you miss class, don't do the reading, or don't have an assignment one day, be prepared for a tantrum.  The class is very high school, except Anton isn't clear about assignments or his expectations.

    Easily the worst professor I've had in my combined six years of undergraduate and graduate studies. His instruction is minimal, favoritism runs high, and he's rarely available when he says he will be. Save yourself $1,500 and open an account on Mediabistro.  They'll give you all the same info on how to pitch to magazines with none of the headache.

    I was less than impressed with Anton on virtually every level. During ENG 309 this fall, He was sort of two-faced -- a nice &quot;laid back&quot; guy in the class room but aloof and unhelpful one on one (he'll tell you to write about &quot;interesting places, things, etc. you and your friends do&quot;). There's also no doubting he plays favorites with his students.

    Easy classes. A little spacey, but good feedback in class. He doesn't grade anything, though, so you just end up w/ a grade at the end of the course. It's kind of arbitrary.

    Ted is amazing and I was lucky to have him as a writing prof. I don't think many of his students realise what a gem he is. He understands a writer's frustration because he fully admits to being there (he's a grad of the Iowa School), but he is incredibly e

    Lay off Ted...I love him.  He's a great teacher and a great guy.  One of the most approachable professors I had in my loooong 6-year undergraduate career.  He even took the entire class out for drinks/dinner on our last day of class.  I like his books, too!

    Nice guy, very knowledgeable writer, interested in his students and understanding. I would take him again. My only problem was that he was a little disorganized at times and I only learned my grade the last week of class. He's a writer just like us who seeks publication. He wants his students to succeed and offer help if you need.

    I wanted to learn about magazine writing!  Unfortunately, Anton was more interested in talking about his book - which in 1994 was not yet published.  Now 10 years later I hear his book is a REQUIRED text for coursework which seems odd,  NOT RECOMMENDED.

    Hes nice outside the classroom but I was so confused half the time as to what he was talking about. I didnt get the hearts&amp; circles. He claimed some true stories werent true enough for him or stories at all. He didnt make a lot of sense and would laugh while we tried to take the midterm and finals.

    I love Professor Anton! He's so random and bizarre--But he's brilliant.  The class set up can be intimidating at first because everyone in class is reading and critiquing your papers, but its so helpful.  Also, the reading we do is so interesting! Take him--he's great!

    He is nice and knows about writing but he is a very critical grader.  He gives poor grades for personal stories which really upset me.  Some of his book selection was bad.  If you take a class with him, good luck getting an A.  It probably won't happen.
