Provides useful feedback on assignments and has some interesting stories to tell.  He goes into great detail about what he expects for each assignment so if you don't follow the directions it might be reflected in your grade, but if you do your work, you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2007<br>Class Name: TL404<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Meticulous grader. Stick to the rubic! Literally, do as it says and do not add to much of your own thoughts that may stray from the assignment. He does allow you to re-submit assignments but everything (including exams) are based on his thoughts only.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2007<br>Class Name: TL404<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tells SO many stories!! Often times, I zoned out for much of the lessons. He is helpful and does care about his students but during his class, I felt like it was a boring version of grown up story time. There were also several students in the class who kept talking about themselves. Overall, Murray was ok.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: TL404<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrence is super nice!  He is a really kind and lovable guy and even baked us brownies one class.  He does tell a lot of stories, but I never minded the repetitiveness.  I really loved this class.  it was a pleasure every week.  Terrence does not understand the concept of getting out of class early, though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2007<br>Class Name: TL404<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His expectations are clear, the workload is reasonable and he is VERY helpful both in and outside of class. He is genuinely nice and tells great stories as well. I recommend taking any class he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2007<br>Class Name: TL610<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Murray is great...he is a nice man and has a lot of practical advice and good stories from his days as a CPS teacher and principal. He gives rubrics for everything.  I definitely recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2007<br>Class Name: TL610<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely self-indulgent. Be prepared for lots of repetitive stories.  Also very stifling of free discussion.  Had very specific and difficult to decipher unwritten requirements for papers; likes to make you rewrite things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2007<br>Class Name: TL404<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor will do anything to help students succeed--spend additional time, create additional materials, and even re-evaluate grades.  Everything--grading included--is clearly presented the first day of class.  No surprises.  Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is a theory course, and an intro one at that, so it is not very engaging.  But Murray is so helpful and such a great man, you can't help but like the class.  He will do anything to help you get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: EE281<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice man!

Has a lot of great stories and practical knowledge that you won't get in textbooks. He gives rubrics for everything and if you follow them you'll do well.
