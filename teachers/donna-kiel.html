We had weekly readings (1-2 chapters per), but we didn't really go over most of the material. Class is based on student led discussions, interdisciplinary lessons, and field experience. Very laid back and chill. Grading is more based on attendance and completion so it's kinda all or none. Overall good class and highly recommended</div></div></div></body></html>
