She is a very easy grader, there are only four major (meaning 3 or 4 pages) writing assignments.  We watched a lot of movies too. Class discussions were usually interesting.  I would definitely recommend ms. steil.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't like the class.
