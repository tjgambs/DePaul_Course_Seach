Super approachable, knows his content really well and explains it really well. Will help you with any problems and stays real with you. When you talk to him it's like talking to a friend and not a professor who thinks he's better than you. Definitely take him, you won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2012<br>Class Name: ANI300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Josh is one of my favorite professors. It's funny how vulgar he is sometimes. But he legitimately gives grat feedback. Hes' not the easiest grader, and he'll let you know that. It's impossible to get 100% on a project unless you're a professional animator. Long story short, take him. I would take him again if I could.</div></div></div></body></html>
