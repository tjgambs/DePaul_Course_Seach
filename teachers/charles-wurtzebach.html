    Wurtz is a no nonsense guy from the southside of Chicago. He's obviously smart &amp; brings tons of real world exp to the classroom. The class itself is a bit disorganized and it almost feels like the prof isn't even interested in teaching the material. Tests were long. And oh yeah he automatically shaves off 5% points of everyone's grade at the end.

    Dr. W does a nice job of mixing real world experiences into the weekly reading and lecture.  His exams are lengthy, and that is what makes them difficult.  The class is "curved", however you never know if it is in your favor.  Expect to spend a lot of time on this class, but it is worth it in the end if you're interested in Real Estate.

    Great class if you really want to learn this subject.  Charlie is exactly the type of teacher I hoped I'd find at DePaul; loads of real world experience and no nonsense.  The course is challenging, but you'll learn a TON about real estate investing.

    Really good professor. He is the most intelligent person in the RE department. He is very knowledgable about real estate investments. If this is your area, he's the professor you MUST take. Warning though, he is a VERY picky grader. You must do ALL the reading before class, and pay attention during his lectures.

    Get ready to teach yourself in this class and spend a LOT of time outside of class. There are three case studies and the last group case can take 40hrs. Exams are somewhat difficult (though he curves). Lectures are rushed and unstructured. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on this course.
