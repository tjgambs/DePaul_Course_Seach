I have had five since starting Russian, and she was the best.  She was extremely helpful and always willing to meet to help with reading and pronunciation, to go over incorrect homework, and to rewrite and rewrite essays.  I can't believe how much my Russian has improved from the 2 semester class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2012<br>Class Name: RUS101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Farida is fantastic. I quickly realized that grades didn't really matter in the end, she just genuinely cares about everybody progressing and learning the language. Comes off as harsh, but is actually the sweetest lady I've met. Take advantage of her office hours to get conversational practice and hear about her life in the Soviet Union!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2010<br>Class Name: RUS101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!! Super helpful and very clear. My only advice is to learn the alphabet BEFORE you attend your first class!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: RUS101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very sweet Russian lady.  She has lived in Russia her whole life so sometimes she struggles with English but that is what I like!  She is very authentic, honest, and when the time comes she can be harsh.  She WILL call on you, she doesn't do any of that American professor BS of waiting for someone to raise their hand.  It's the only way to</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2009<br>Class Name: RUS101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's such a sweetheart! Explains the material very well and is a nice lighthearted person. Makes Russian go by fast. She is also the most elegant lady I've ever had as a teacher! Props for her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2008<br>Class Name: RUS101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She explains the material the best of her abilitiy (which is very well).  Overall, great teacher but HORRIBLE TEXTBOOK.  You might want to buy some sort of supplemental text to help you understand the material. DON'T MISS CLASS.  Missing class will leave you so far behind that it will be very difficult to get caught up.  Overall, great teacher.</div></div></div></body></html>
