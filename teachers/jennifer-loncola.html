    Really cares about her subject and helps make boring, technical info understandable. Didn't care about this subject before starting, but thought it was valuable at the end.

    I took this course online.  She was one of the best professors I've had DePaul.  I got so much out of it.  I can't imagine what her regular classes are like.

    An easy class to snooze through, though she is energetic and enthusiastic. There are 3 quizzes based on the reading and a paper, very easy class to pass.

    She has a very natural talent for understanding the mind of the child.  She often goes into impersonations of children/students that she works demonstrating a profound level of empathy for the exceptional child.

    She is young, vibrant, &quot;hot&quot; and as a result relates well to the students. She is not as much easy as she is very understanding where students are coming from and acclimates her teaching to that. She is very competent in &quot;Special Needs&quot; and that shows not only in the material she teaches but her delivery as well.

    Prof. Loncola is awesome, she loves what she teaches and it shown! I learned so much on children with special needs that I feel able to teach them although I am a regular ed. teacher.  But the lectures do sound repetitive but it's an easy course with 3 tests and thats all!  Take it it's worth it!

    This class wasn't something I was interested in (it was required) but she made class fun.  Not easy but I think she cares about her students.

    The lecture only format of her class gets a little boring, but she really cares about this topic.

    I learned a ton from her! She wasn't easy (per say) but it was very worth it! She is very passionate about the area she teaches and it shows!
