He was very direct with what he wanted. Pretty simple class if you showed up and listened. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2012<br>Class Name: JOUR343<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a good class because he walks through how journalism has shaped America and how it has evolved over time. He was a little vague on what he wanted for his weekly papers and it was hard to have a discussion in class because he would cut you off. maybe for the sake of time but students were bothered by that. Overall he was good</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2012<br>Class Name: JOUR343<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does the exact same BB identifier every class and the "lets take you there now" intro to the coordinating clip. Clearly passionate about his work but has no clue how to teach, stimulate ANY discussion, or keep people interested. I would stay far away. This guy is the opposite of a great and memorable professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2012<br>Class Name: JOUR343<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is good and he is a very funny guy. I don't think he means to be, but he s a bit odd which reflects in his teaching. He has "blue book identifiers" in which he gives you pointers as to what will be on the tests. There is too many and it's hard to keep up with the amount of them. Overall this class was ok. but be prepared to study hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2010<br>Class Name: CMUN5<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NEVER take more than one of this man's classes, ever. He recycles video clips and lectures among every class. How he keeps teaching &quot;different&quot; classes, I don't know. He makes meandering points that reeeeeeeeeach out for the most arbitrary meanings and definitely plays favorites.  He's understanding with late papers, though, which is a plus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2010<br>Class Name: JOUR275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't count grades for the first few weeks of class until you start doing well on your assignments.  He doesn't take attendance there are in-class writing activities that you can't miss. Reading/ current events quizzes once a week and you have to write a 2-page story every week too. Great teacher though--you will definitely learn a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2010<br>Class Name: NMS502<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The content is pretty easy.  But this professor fails to set clear and concise assignment criteria.  Many students in past yeras have complained about Dr. Evensen's teaching practices.  He would like you to guess what he wants in the assignment. When I ask him for clarification, he seems confused.  Do not take his class unless required!  Petition!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2009<br>Class Name: JOUR501<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have had the privlage of taking three of his graduate level courses.  He has high expectations of his students but if you're willing to work very hard, do all the readings, and not miss class, you will do well.  He is one of the smartest people I have ever met and his passion for journalism makes anyone want to be a writer or reporter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2009<br>Class Name: CMN100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2009<br>Class Name: NMS502<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was absurd. He teaches a graduate requirement in new media studies yet knows ZERO about new media and spends the entire time showing VHS clips. Arbitrary grader who shows his journalistic background by nitpicking on details rather than giving helpful feedback on theories you bring up. Terrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: CMN502<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved the class and very informative and I enjoyed it, but all the busy work of all the papers we had to write..cmon gimme a break--i have better things to do with my time--like my job and I don't know...life&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2009<br>Class Name: MC395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Teacher, you can hear his intelligence in his lectures (which can get boring after three hours) but his grading and corrections are heavily extensive. He doesnt allow things to slip through the cracks so you have to be at your best with the pen in mind.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2007<br>Class Name: CMN343<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You NEED to be in class in order to get the blue book identifiers. He assigns 2-3 readings that you have to discuss with him during class. I have had mass communications and journalism with him and I love his style, but he is not an easy grader even when you study a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2007<br>Class Name: CMN275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great journalism teacher. Take his class and your writing will improve tenfold. Knows how to get the most out of his students, and is very willing to help. The first week or so looks to weed out all of the kids who are too lazy to take the class. You will put a lot of work into the class, but it is worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2007<br>Class Name: NMS502<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Completely dull. Every class is exactly the same: video clip, lecture, video clip, lecture, video clip, lecture, repeat ad nauseum. Maybe if he'd vary his teaching style, students would stay interested. Why we can only use the in-class readings for the research papers&#63; Isn't the whole idea of a Master's program to be able to do research on our own&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2007<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>INCREDIBLE teacher! This man is truly dedicated and passionate about his work and makes lectures interesting. He is well-spoken and easy to understand and has more video footage than any other human being should ever possess. It's not a blowoff class but you don't have to buy the book and if you memorize the terms for the exam you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2006<br>Class Name: CMN375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An awesome teacher and an intelligent Man. Anyone seriously pursuing journalism and/or broadcast at DePaul who doesn't take one of his classes is really missing out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2006<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVED THIS CLASS!!!!!  You gotta respect a man that takes the time to have video footage as examples for every single point he makes.  That's alot of time!  Because of the different types of material he'd have, it was always very engaging.  He was pretty funny and would always tell you what's on the test while he lectures.  GREAT PROFESSOR!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2006<br>Class Name: CMN110SUMMER<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As much as taking summer courses is lame, Evensen is a very engaging teacher.  Every lecture was very well prepared, with supporting readings and clips.  He tells you EXACTLY what to prepare for in terms of the midterm and final and is super helpful if you come in during his office hours.  You can tell he loves the subject and is very well versed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love evensen! He is very educated and experienced in journalism. I think maybe you have to absolutely love journalism to enjoy his class though, because it is rather tough and lots of writing. But if you don't mind the work, you can really learn a lot from him. If you take the time to talk to him, he'll go out of his way to help you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2006<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class even though it covered a ton of material, he made it somewhat fun and enjoyable. Really likeable guy, good class to take.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2006<br>Class Name: JRNLSCLTMED<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While he may be a little tough, if you're interested in television, journalism or the history or media take him! He's very interesting and wililng to help outside of class. Sit in the front row and he'll love you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: MASSCOM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>interesting and doable class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: CMN110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Though a difficult class in that there are only two grades, I really enjoyed his class.

He gives you about a hundred &quot;blue book identifyers&quot; and the whole class is pretty much based upon a midterm and a final, covering a LOT of  material.  All you do is listen to him lecture the whole time, dont take him for longer than an hour a day, it'll suck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2005<br>Class Name: JOURNALISM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2005<br>Class Name: JOURNALISM<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2005<br>Class Name: CMN346<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty okay in some areas. The use of his video clips are helpful in keeping you interested during class time. However, even though he gives you &quot;blue book identifiers&quot; (possible exam questions), it sounds easier than it really is because he gives you about 500 of them and you use only...20. That's rough. Also evident that he picks favorites.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2005<br>Class Name: 346<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy. Sometimes hovers over students, so don't sit in the front row. Illustrates what he talks about with a lot of video clips, which is helpful. Good lectures but a lot of info, take good notes.

He's so funny and nice to all students.  We just watched news/movie/tv show clips in class and he explained them.

I took him for my first CMN class and it seemed to be very interesting. However, he graded midterms difficultly and I ended up with a C- on it (depsite the fact that I included all his requirements).
