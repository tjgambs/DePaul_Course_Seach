Learning from other students is nice, but not helpful to the actual learning part. Too much focus on editing and not enough on composition.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2013<br>Class Name: AI167<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was enjoyable but I didn't learn as much as I had hoped.  Prof Stein was concerned with students getting their monies worth, but my personal preference would have been to spend more time on composition than digital editing.  At times Prof Stein took a long time to grade my work.  I would recommend this prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2013<br>Class Name: AI167<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Hartwig Stein is a very passionate online instructor.
