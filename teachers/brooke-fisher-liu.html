    Her class was very interesting! Also, she is willing to really help you if you put in the effort. However, you have to study for her quizes, they aren't very easy things. If you put in the effort she will definitely reward you with a good grade.

    Loved her class! There is a lot of reading and its important to actually read and attend class and participate in class discussions, but she is very insightful and gives valuable feedback. I only missed one class the whole semester because I actually liked her lectures. I would highly recommend her.
