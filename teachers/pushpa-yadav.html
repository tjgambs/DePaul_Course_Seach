Engage her and you'll make a friend. Very helpful and offers extra credit if you ask. Accent is tricky but you'll adjust.

She's a very nice person but very hard to understand and is a little boring in the lectures. For an intro class, she expects alot for you to know on quizes. Definitely not an easy A and definitely a class you need to work for.</div></div></div></body></html>
