    One of the smartest teachers i have ever met. This guy should be teaching at Harvard, he is that smart. If you are willing to put in the work, you will learn tons from him.

    One of the worst professors I had at DePaul. Expects way too much; readings are super long, wants participation but bashes you when you do.

    The most brilliant scholar in Chicago. This is not an over-statement. Take his classes. The depth of his knowledge displayed in class is just the tip of the iceberg.

    I have never been so uncomfortable. He acts like he hates you and is too good to be there. Nobody talks because he makes you feel like you're stupid if you do but then gets mad that people don't want to talk.

    He's definitely out there to say the least. Assigns substantial amounts of abstractchallenging reading each week, expects a lot from his students. Approached him for help on numerous occasions but he could never manage to meet me outside of class. Would not recommend taking his 331 course.

    By far the worst teacher I've ever had. He knows his stuff but more often than not is unwilling to teach. He kicked the class out 5 different times. He seems to have a fairly serious anger problem. He assigns a reading load of 300+ pages per week, then gets mad when people are unable to answer his arbitrary, nitpicky questions.

    Prof Hancock is a great teacher and very smart. I've learned so much from him. The readings are interesting (and required). Only one final paper and participation are your grade. Come prepared to talk. My only issue with him is his mood and attitude. If he's having a bad day, he takes it out on the class. Beware of his pessimism and mood swings

    He is a wonderful teacher! I am part of the learning disability program at DePaul and he has been more then helpful when it comes to accommodations. I highly recommend him.  He is very smart and very easy to understand during the lectures. Although the books are almost impossible to comprehend, he does a great job  clarifying them during class.

    One of my favorite courses and professors. No cellphone or laptop use in class but this forces you whiny undergrads to pay attention. Be prepared to say what you think... but make sure you think before you say it.  The readings are WORTH reading and what you take away from the course (as well as how much you enjoy it) will reflect what you put in.

    Very intelligent, eccentric,&amp; funny often.Ive taken him for a #of classes as an undergrad &amp; grad student. I dont think he cares for undergrad classes much because they tend to not take the subject matter seriously. Grad courses he lectures the full time &amp; actually tries to teach you. He acts arrogant and pretends not to care, but I believe he does.

    Let me quote what someone wrote about this guy:&quot;The best teacher at DePaul.Wrote one paper at the end of the quarter..and he dint even want us to.Easy A.He thought about making us do a diarama. Always let us out early &amp; I nevr read books.&quot;ARE YOU SERIOUS&#63;What are you doing at DePaul&#63;It's a shame that DePaul's profs reinforce this stupidity.

    He has a few screws loose. Def. does not care about students and lets you know it. Hes somewhat entertaining with a hint of scary. The class was easy and he doesnt expect much of you except for a long paper at the end of class, but he is not a hard grader. Makes you buy at least 6 or 7 books that you dont really have to read.

    He's kind of odd, but he's pretty cool.  Attendance isn't completely mandatory and you don't need to really read all of the books.  There is a 15 page paper due at the end of the quarter and that's pretty much it.  He can be funny too.

    if you show up and turn in a paper you will pass the class. i didnt even read the books and turned in a 9 page paper that had to be 15 pages and still passed. he comes off as really serious, but he's not that bad of a guy.

    He's definitely weird, but it's an easy class. you don't have to really show up, minimal use of the (confusing) books he had us read on Lacan. He gave me an A and all I did was turn in a paper. He's hilarious and crazy!Best class at DePaul so far. Take him!

    Wow, well.  Blackhawk really is something.  It is so interesting to go to his class, since he really doesn't know if he is awake or dreaming, or what is real etc...  He once taught us ow to make &quot;real&quot; martinis and I had some grade A quotes by him.  ex. &quot;Look forward to a life of therapy&quot;.  I think everyone should take one of his classes.

    This is the most pointless class I have ever taken at DePaul. Had him for a night class and we never stayed more than an hour and a half.  I got an A because I doubt he ever graded anyone all quarter. Class participation and final paper are the only grades. I guess he's good for commerce students looking for an easy A.

    I didn't really want to take this class, but it turned out great. My 10-pg final earned an A. We got off course with the syllabus which caused class discussions to be...non-existent but then he gave us an eye-opening lecture. the guy tells it like it is...just get over it.

    This prof. is useless.  He encourages students to NOT care about the class or their education in general and is then upset when students dont respond with enthusiasm.  He doesn't lecture so the point of the class remains unclear and then surprises the class with a 10 page paper.  I dont mind working hard, but the prof has to teach something first.

    Very easy class; mildly interesting. The books never came in until like Week 5, so we had to rely on lecture for the most part, but his intention was for us to read ourselves and come for discussion. Not a demanding class at all: one final paper and one presentation is your entire grade. And he was rather lenient in grading both. I'd take him again

    This professor is one of the select brilliant minds at DePaul. If this is thoroughly understood prior to entering the classroom, students will not mind undertaking courses that are obviously far beyond their collective grasp. True, he is a bit relaxed on grading; but if students are able to complete the course material, they deserve the grade.

    Despite his cockiness, this guy actually has some really interesting ideas. Suggestions: His lectures need to be more structured. Besides that, just cut-out the baking right before passing out his evaluation forms...that idea left a bad taste in the mouth (not literally, but it made him look bad). Now all I have to do is see how he grades...

    This teacher was rather, interesting. Final consisted of a presentation out of the readings. Class isn't difficult, and the teacher offers some legitimate insight. Not really recommended to soc majors, but everyone else should come out of this class enlightened.

    The best teacher at DePaul. Since im a lazy ass, it worked out PRETTY DARN WELL. Wrote one paper at the end of the quarter...and he dint even want us to. Easy A. He thought about making us do a diarama. LOL. Always let us out early &amp; I nevr read books. Was goin to take him for HON201, (he said he was teachin) apparently they dint let him. ****s.

    This class was a utter waste of my money and time but I am happy beacause I got my A. He taught us absolutely nothing. I took a night class with him and he literally came in, showed a video, talked about it, and dismissed us. Class was only 1 hour long instead of 3. I am glad I am not a Sociology major otherwise I would be screwed big time.

    one of the worst professors i've ever had. he doesn't teach at all but he is super easy and curves all the tests so even if you never go to class or pay attention you'll do fine. he is just crazy and i don't know why people think he is easy on the eyes.ew!

    Hilarious... and easy, he's there if you want to learn, if not then you don't have to go.  Nice how attendance is nothing, and all the tests are heavily curved.  Plus, he's hot.

    Heh, I was in the same class as the last guy who posted - we're apparently not unique snowflakes... Anyhow, this guy is crazy, but a terrible teacher. He knows his material, but he's a ridiculously tough grader. His class involves 4+ hours of studying a night and his 4 papers require 15-18 pages each - DEFINATELY not worth taking.

    Cool Prof. deff. knows what he's talking about. 1 problem, if you're in a class where no1 talks and no1 seems to care. . .he can have a lil attitude, understandably, b/c he feels he's wasting his time w/ people who don't care.  Tip: if damn near the whole basketball team's in your class chances are: you'll see this side of him

    This professor is CRAZY.  He is very knowledgable about race &amp; ethinicity, especially African-Americans.  Many classes are cancelled and the classes are filled with laughter or technology issues.  He is a great guy and wants to you to take something with you, whether it is opening your eyes on the El or whatever.  Great guy &amp; don't get worried!

    Clearly the Tyler Durden of Teachers. Watch Fight Club and you will know what i mean.  He teaches the same concepts and ideas as him.  He does not goes as far as blowing up buildings, but he exposes your mind to the real reality of life.  Go go in with your mind open and absorb every piece of information he says and an A will come.

    The class was cool, cept that no one really talked do there almost no discussion. he's great and knows what he's talking about, but at the same time he knows who doesn't care about the class, and so his attitude towards them can come out sometimes.

    great class. teacher is very smart and can explain and relate to college students. hes funny and entertaining while still teaching the material. not much guidance with anything-one small paper and one big one so its hard to tell where you stand with grades. but you will learn a lot if you want to

    I really did not want to take his class and at first did not know what to make of it or his style. It caught me off gaurd a bit. He is direct and brings up issues we've been taught in society not to talk about. You will get out of this class only what you put in, make the effort and its great.

    Prof. Blackhawk knows DePaul students for what they truly are--slacker numbskulls--which is probably the only reason he was so lenient on grading. He has potential to be an amazing lecturer, unfortunately, 60% of his theory will probably go over students' heads.

    Do not do this, but for the final, I handed in the midterm, the exact same thing, I only changed on top, Midterm Paper to Final Paper, and not only did he not notice, I got A's on both, but there were different comments on the exact same paper. Go figure, Easiest A at DePaul

    Class was kind of a joke, as it was cancelled often and when class was in session lasted an average of 30-45 minutes.  Teacher is very cool.  Class was easy.  Have to write 1 5-6 page paper for the midterm and another 5-6 page paper for the final.

    I believe that he has seen all of these comments about giving people easy A's.  I wrote to excellent papers which addressed all issues that he assigned and still got B's on both.  He's a great teacher, but I am very unstisfied with my grade.

    horrible teacher. Only interested in discussion that would generate good quotes for his thesis. He seemed like he hated teaching and i'm not even sure why he is a teacher. it is an easy A though.

    This teacher is one of a kind.  He let's us out in half an hour and it's a night class.  Never stayed longer than an hour and a half.  Knows you have to take this class, so he makes it painless for you and himself.  Take him by all means!

    I loved this class so much. It was like watching a mini-series on TV every week because his lectures were so energetic and passionate. I would take his classes again. Oh, and I think everyone got an A.

    Multiculturalism in US. This class would get pretty boring sometimes, the prof is very laid back, as long as you pay attention and read the stuff you should be fine.
