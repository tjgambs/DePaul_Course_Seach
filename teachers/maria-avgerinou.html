The weekly &quot;reflections&quot; were not helpful. Maria seems very nice and smart, but I learned everything from the book, not from her (nature of online classes&#63;). The group project due at the end of the qtr drove me crazy throughout the entire course. Do not take this class online!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took online course. It is extremely disorganized. She is organized herself, but the course syllabus and handouts are about 100 pages of unnecesary verbage thats all over.Trying to figure out what she wants out of the assignments takes longer than doing the assignments. Lots of busy work to do as well. Texts are fairly out of date and pretty basic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely easy professor, but you learn alot as well.
