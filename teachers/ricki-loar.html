Was able to clearify material so that the consepts were understood. Unlike her co instructor who did not know up from down and plagerized material from other instructor and educational content. Instruction is more than reading a document.

I am sorry that she is no longer at DePaul, as she was the only professor in the Nurse Practitioner program that taught from evidence and not simply from her own experience. We were challenged to critically examine evidence -- so important in healthcare delivery.</div></div></div></body></html>
