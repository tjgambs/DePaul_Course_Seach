    He is the reason why the DePaul Finance Department will never be best in class.  Extremely arrogant.

    This guy is hard to understand, and is not very accomodating after class.  But if you want to do well, he usually takes his test questions from the examples in the back of the book, or a study guide.   :)

    Took MBA course, he was very unclear - test had nothing to do with lecture. Too bad he runs department, so if you take him, there is nowhere to turn.

    Good class. Case projects every week (only 2 pages).   Doesn't give you much insight on how you do on your projects.   No midterm or final.
