At first, he may appear intimidating, which couldn't be further from the truth. Overall easy classes. He is very laid back in his teaching style and lenient with due dates. Gain practical, real-world knowledge and experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: HSP206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken Dr Maier for several classes and I absolutely love him. He is incredibly laid back and easy to get along with. His teaching is very much about practical thought than anything else and he is a very loose grader. I plan to take him for several more classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2013<br>Class Name: HSP362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Maier is by far my favorite hospitality professor at DePaul. He is there for any work, school or professional guidance and has a true concern for his students. His assignments are clear and can be meticulous however they  help you develop educationally. I always come out of his classes more knowledgeable than before. Definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2013<br>Class Name: HSP206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Dr. Maier, he is tough and gives big assignments but they are definately doable since he gives you class time and groups to work on them with. He is interested in the subject and really enjoys teaching and the classes are fun. I didn't take him this quarter and I actually missed having him as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2011<br>Class Name: HSP360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Maier is among the best at DePaul. Very helpful and interesting. Lots of connections in the industry and knowledge about the subjects. He brings real world experience to the classroom</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2011<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Taken for 100, 203, and 204. Amazing Professor. Such an interesting guy with a worldly view. Classes are always a pleasure to attend. You will learn much more than classroom material from him.</div></div></div></body></html>
