    Boring boring boring! I hated almost every minute of this class except the movies and the song we got to sing at the end of the quarter.  She is harsh and does not encourage class participation at all.  I will never take her again.

    Easy, Nice and intersting. Class is a little random and unorganized but there isn't any work so it doesn't matter. She likes her topic and likes to help students. Recomend her for basic art history

    Not only was it hard to understand her constant lecturing beyond her accent, it was also hard to follow someone so unorganized. I even tried to participate but it was hard b/c all she wanted to do was prove how much she new about African culture.NOTGOOD!

    She knows her material very well. She lectures in detail and gives review sheets for midterm and finals. Extra credit points are given as well. Dont know why students give her a bad review. I think she is a great teacher

    She Is one of the best people in the world.  If students are having a hard time then you should go to her during her office hours.  She will spend alot of time helping you. She loves what she does but finds it hardtoteachstudentswhentheydon'twanttobethere

    Cannot understand. Hard tests. Expects the students to know what is important and what is not. Makes it almost impossible to take notes. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.

    African art teacher.  She's just so unorganized for an art history teacher.  And she expected us to know how to spell African definitions in addition to her German accent.
