She encourages different opinions on assignments. My opinions hardly ever were the same as hers but she really respected that. This is very rare to find in a professor. The class was very fast pace but it was 5-weeks so it was expected. The class was well organized that it was pretty easy to keep up with assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2013<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Wright was awesome! She was well organized, answered questions fast, and gave lots of extra credit. I learned a lot from her class. There were straightforward quizzes, activities, and a final paper. As long as you work hard and keep up her class is easy. She is very willing to help as well. I would definitely take her again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2013<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class.

Helpful professor! All materials up on day 1 for the class to allow students to work ahead. There are not exams in the class, but there are discussions, papers, and quizzes.

Ms. Wright is extremely nice and helpful; she always e-mailed me back and had the entire course schedule posted from Day 1. If you wanted to finish the entire class in a week too, you had that option. No mid-term and only a final 3-5 page paper. Overall she was great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2013<br>Class Name: PSY333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Wright is just too sweet.

She is always willing to help. She is prompt at answering any questions. The assignments were good. The tests were a bit challenging because the class is more discussion based (requires you to take your own notes).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2011<br>Class Name: PSY334<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this class!

She has reviews before the exams. She could not make the last reivew session and emailed everyone. The person who asked about her not showing up for the exam was actually the rude person... The review sessions were nice but she didn't HAVE to do them! This shows how much she wanted her students to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the people below to an extent. But she is very irresponsible, unorganized and she just didn't show up for the final review. She snapped at people when they brought it up to her. Very rude and hates being wrong.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Statisitics is hard in general, so it's not going to be easy. She is THE BEST! She explains everything with so much detail and makes sure you understand it. She is always willing to help out. Seriously she's the best professor ever, and you need that for a stats class!! TAKE HER! Not much homework and She lets you use notes on tests and quizzes!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2011<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Considering its a statistics class and not that fun of a topic, prof.
