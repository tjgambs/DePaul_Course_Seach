I have learned so much from his class. He tells you what is going on in teaching and really makes you feel like you can do something about it. He is more than a teacher, but a guide. If you ever need someone to talk to he is there and willing to listen. Take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2012<br>Class Name: ED207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Coolest professor!

Not the easy A (or A-) I thought--his grade scale seems high, but I get it. Not a truckload of readings, but he keeps you busy thinking.

I absolutely loved this class.  Mr. Hall found many ways to keep the class engaged in the material we were learning.  We frequently worked in groups in this class.
