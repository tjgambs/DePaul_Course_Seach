Guest speakers and a huge project make you look into the real world and really learn whats going on. Not insanely hard, but if you dont keep up... you will struggle. Get started on the project early... Its alot of work. Good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2008<br>Class Name: ACC599<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pr. Belcik is great! Lot of homework projects, but all very relevant to real world. Interesting material and outside speakers. I wish DePaul had more accounting professors like Pr. Belcik.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2008<br>Class Name: ACC599<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher! He went to DePaul and brings a ton of experience to the classroom. Fun projects, and actually makes accounting fun! He also cares a ton about the students and their future. He arranged guest speakers that applied the topics to the real world. Great Guy and a Great Class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2008<br>Class Name: ACC599<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at DePaul!
