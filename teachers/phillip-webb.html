    Great class. Really cared about students. When lots of people did badly on the midterm, gave us the chance to write an exta paper. Class alternated--one day lecture, next day discussion. So we got to hear from him and also talk.

    I had Prof. Webb for my LSP112 and I barely went but still got a B. He acts like an easy grader but is extreamly diffcult on papers and the midterm which left me confused.

    Webb knows everything about US History. He likes to flaunt his large vocabulary and his knowledge at times. He's an easy grader but the class is really boring. It's nothing but a lecture every class.

    This was a fun, light-hearted class. Dr. Webb helped us discuss controversial subjects in American history. He made it fun. He's fair and engaging.

    Professor Webb is really boring.  The class was obscenely boring because we literally did the same thing every single class.  There were no variations.  He seems like he is clear on what he wants in terms of papers, etc. but then when asking questions like what to fix or correct, he is absolutely no use. Also really slow at replying to emails.

    BORING!!!!! I would never recommend this class. Talks on an on, and you can't even stay awake not mentioning listening to what he talks about.Seems to be easy going, like he doesn't care about anything and then he gets to the grading..that's the time when he wants to be a real professor.

    probably the worst teacher i have ever had. first i would like to nominate him for what not to wear because hes outfits distract from what is being said. most monotones voice i have ever heard, thats if you hear it because he mumbles to himself instead of talking to the class. makes class very uncomfortable when asking questions and no one ansswers
