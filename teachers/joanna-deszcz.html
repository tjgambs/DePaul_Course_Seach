She explains the topics clearly and assigns helpful homeworks which let you practice what you learned.

I though the large group project would be the death of me, so choose a good group and stay organized. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2015<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of information especially if you have no Excel experience. (Yes this is an Excel class). Make sure you pick a good article at the beginning of the quarter bc you end up locked into working with it the whole time. She does a good job in answering questions but sometimes seems annoyed. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2015<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Let me just put this out there- I don't like math. That said, I really enjoyed this class. Joanna always made sure the material was explained in ways that everyone could understand it. She was always watching to make sure you weren't making little mistakes along the way and taught everything in a way that it was relevant. Important class for all. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2014<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>She's a really good professor, tries all she can do to make students feel comfortable. Her exams are long and tough. There's a group project in this class and it's hellish (especially if you have a bad group). There are in-class assignments (some have 2-3), homework assignments, a midterm, and a final. Suggest taking online course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2014<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joanna is a very helpful teacher. Class is easy. You need to show up do the work and you will get a good grade. She wants you to succeed. Do your work don't fool around in class and she will like you</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2014<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>By far one of the worst professors I have ever had. She speeds through the course material, rarely explaining anything in depth. She also accused me of cheating on group work (whatever that even means). All in all, just one of the worst classes I have EVER taken, led by a shoddy professor at best. I DO NOT RECOMMEND HER AS A PROFESSOR.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2014<br>Class Name: 120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Makes LSP 120 easy and actually enjoyable. You would be doing a disservice in taking anyone else for this course. Be ready for some long assignments. But after this class, I understood statistics and Excel better than I had ever before.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice person and is very easy but not really clear with exactly what she wants. She also just gives out pointless assignments that are very time consuming. You'll get annoyed with how many homework and in class assignments you receive but if you do it and take your time it is a really easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So very helpful. there are lectures (power-points) every class along with in class activities that you do with a partner that is just participation as you can edit it if its wrong. then homeworks that she basically gives you class time to do. She is the sweetest lady and very helpful with everything. midterm is super easy along with final! take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'll admit I wasn't looking forward to taking this class, but once Joanna started teaching I actually became excited. GREAT PROFESSOR. Explains everything. All you have to do is show up and try and you will probably get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best pofessor I've had at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>show up to class, get an A.

Clear directions, stays focused, cool personality. The material (excel & numbers) are boring but she taught it pretty well. Classes are just lectures, in-class excel activities and homework. EASY.

She won't cut slack</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Joanna was a great teacher.

Basically you just follow along on your computer with what she's doing on a big screen.
