This class was absolutely boring. Prof. Brown tends to shoot students down and spends most of the class lecturing.  She also won't let you miss ANY days, if you skip one class you have to meet with her privately to make it up.  No thank you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2007<br>Class Name: LSI460<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh No! Here we go again!! Why do we wfill out the evaluation forms if NOTHING  changes&#63;&#63; this teacher does the same thing again: read the chapter, make a summery and still she goes over it in a tedious way!!!!! Ridiculous!! Improving the educational department&#63; Start with the professors!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2007<br>Class Name: LSI460<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Will make you outline every chapter in the textbook (2-3 pages)!!  Excessive amount of busy work takes away from the quality of the rest of the assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2006<br>Class Name: LSI1446<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows everything better. &quot;oh honey, ;et me tell you this...&quot; well, she is not the only teacher with an opinion; there are more opinions!!! She talks about students to other students, and she bribes people to make her look better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2005<br>Class Name: LSI446<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is blunt (which is sometimes annoying and often amusing). She knows her special ed stuff, but could use more engaging activities and not rely on teaching class with long notes from the book...gets boring fast. Class seems neverending. Early assignments (outlining chapters) are pointless...the rest were relevant. Overall she was ok.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2005<br>Class Name: LSI446<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class lasts way too long. She knows her stuff, but instead of useful discussion she throws her notes from the book on the overhead and proceeds to read them for the rest of the class. Then she'll let students work in groups to answer the same questions and you basically hear the same answers over and over. Her bluntness can be entertaining though.</div></div></div></body></html>
