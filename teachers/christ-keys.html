Gives very challenging assignments, but is extremely supporting. Very open and will go a long way to help you in class, on the email, in his office. The tests really make you learn and think - cramming doesn't work! Uses multiple ways of teaching - incl. service learning. Gives a very profound learning experience!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2009<br>Class Name: COMMPSYC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I read all of these comments before I took him and I was like you know what it cant be that bad. Wrong. Do not be mistaken, the class was interesting but the format and organization is what will upset you most. There's a lot of information to take in and if you do not study for the midterm, hmmm lets say from day 1 of class, you will not be prepare</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2009<br>Class Name: PSY354<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I could not even follow his lectures when i tried, his tests and papers were impossible! Don't take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2009<br>Class Name: PSY357<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He took 5 weeks to hand back our midterm, and just as long for other paper assignments.  He is difficult to follow during class lecture and does not explain the subject sufficiently.  I did not enjoy this class, and despite my decent grade I had no idea what was going on.Do not take him!  Hardest psychology class I've ever taken, and least favorite</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2009<br>Class Name: PSY305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chris keys seems to be a very nice guys. The material is very dry and boring. The midterms and final covers at least 8 chapters, and too much material. No extra credit if offered. Very hard grader as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2005<br>Class Name: COMMUNITYPSYC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Keys is a joke.  He is hands down the worst instructor I have ever had in my three years at Depaul.  Besides myself, I personally know at least five other straight A, fourth year students that were forced to withdrawl from his class to avoid a grade of D or worse.  He is absolutely terrrible at teaching-seriously, his class was a joke.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2004<br>Class Name: COMMUNITYPSYCH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Keys is one of the kindest, most genuine people you will ever meet!Don't mistake his kindness for an easy &quot;A&quot;!This was the hardest psych class I have had at DePaul.Neither the midterm nor the final had ONE multiple choice question.All of the questions were short answer or long answer and essays!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2004<br>Class Name: PSY354<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chris Keys rocks!  He really knows his stuff and he's basically the rockstar professor of the psychology department.  If you are into community psychology, take his course and learn as much as you can from this man.</div></div></div></body></html>
