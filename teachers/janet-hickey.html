Best professor I've had. I took explore and my freshman focal point with her, and now work with her. She is one of the best professors at DePaul; any chance you have to take a class from her, do it. She expects a lot, but cares a lot, too. You will learn so much and all of the reading is interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a wonderful, kind person and teacher. I would recommend this focal point class to my friends. She assigns long readings, about 30 pages per class, so be prepared for that. She also assigns 4 essays which are challenging and time consuming. Overall, she is an amazing teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112IRISH<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a wonderful, kind person and teacher!
