BIG into attendance. He sometimes confused me because he didn't know what he was talking about. Made a lot of references to historical and political things, which didn't help me because I am not real big into that stuff. Overall, class is pretty easy, just do the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very awkward teacher, but very knowledgeable. Don't listen to the other reviews hes AWESOME. I got an A. There are no right or wrong answers in his class. He will hear out your opinions. I'm currently taking him for WRD 104. His instructions can be a bit confusing when really the homework is really simple. Take this class if you want an A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked this class. The teacher is pretty nice and does sometimes challenge you. Some of the assignments were really confusing. All of the class couldnt understand what we were supposed to do sometimes. There are four papers total. The exam is just a portfolio. it was pretty easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very awkward and confusing.

Terrible class organization. Never gave clear instructions for an assignment. The entire class was a joke.

I recommend that to any freshman ;)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a cool guy and is very smart. Excellent with english and writing. His class isn't super easy, you actually have to try in your writing. He has you write plenty of drafts and keeps the converation in class really engaging. I really liked the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very confusing class. It is pretty easy, with mandatory attendance but I never-ever knew what was going on. Just be passionate about your writing to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Robert is easy to make fun of. He takes his job teaching required freshman English very seriously. He is passionate about taking attendance every day and using index cards to call on people to awkwardly answer open ended questions. The class was boring, and he crams too much in after the midterm, but he is a nice guy and grades easily on papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice guy but his bad organization makes his class stressful. Lots of writing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>make sure to go to class because hes an attendance fien.theres a lot of class particpation invovled but its easy to particpate because he makes you write your name on a notecard the first day of class then randomly picks names to call on. overall though i think this was an easy class just make sure you turn in your homework</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes you teach yourself pretty much. so boring. waste of time. crazy with attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is tolerable. While you learn a lot of researching skills, there is a lot of padding in his lectures as well as a lot of jumping around in topics. He does attendance and makes you do underlining assignments (rolleyes), in the end though he is fairly easy. Portfolio sounds like a big deal - it is not.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE IS AN OK TEACHER THAT DOES PARTICIPATION BY NOTE CARDS THAT HE TELLS U TO WRITE YOUR NAME ON FIRST DAY OF CLASS. I HATED IT! CONTINUED A MEANLESS ASSIGNMENT ALL QUARTER. DOESNT TALK CLEARLY MOST OF THE TIME. BORED OUT OF MY MIND IN THIS CLASS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is demanding in class with homework and questions, but usually an easy grader on papers. very helpful. nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Classes can get repetitive, but he's a nice guy.  Plus, he calls on everyone so it's easy to participate.  He's not too easy on grading the essays but go to class and do the hwk and you should get a decent grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All he talks about is cultural analysis. It will make you want to scream. Papers are easy. There are only four papers. Grades easy. A lot of peer editing. Easy A. The only bad thing is, he'll bore you to death with &quot;cultural analysis.&quot;</div></div></div></body></html>
