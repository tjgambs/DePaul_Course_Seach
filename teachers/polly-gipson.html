Will miss her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: PSY366<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Organized, yes. Rude, oh yeah. &quot;I want you to talk, um, but not really&quot; - That's how I feel.  Go ahead, ask &#63;s, but you aren't getting answers... Someone said she was rude in a polite way:  Perfect description.  And, it's not a good thing. Sure, she's smart in her area of interest, but NO, she should not be teaching! Rude, how else do you say it&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: PSY366<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY VERY VERY RUDE! She asks for comments, then poses her own ideas onto you. She doesnt want you to talk about anything that doesnt agree with what she knows. Agreeing with the other raters, she needs to hurry up and graduate and NEVER EVER TEACH AGAIN!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2006<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want an easy A...don't take her but if you are a good student who likes challenges she is the best! I had her for all the classes she taught. if you study her powerpoint presentations well you will get an A. She gives tons of examples from her practice which makes you want to work in the field. Great Teacher!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gipson is a bad teacher.  She is unfair and needs to graduate quickly so she dosent have to teach anymore.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2006<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I do not know what class the person below was taking, but Professor Gipson is not extremely easy (definitely not a 5), most people do not get As or even A-minuses--now if they were that would be easy. You have to work hard to even get a B on the tests. Gipson is not the greatest, but at least the course material was interesting. Take if you must.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I reccommend that you take her ONLY if you need this class to fufil a requirement in your last year.  She is so full of herself(what can you say shes a &quot;doctoral candidate&quot; as she says); she is constantly cutting people off; She is rude in a polite way, which is bad!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2006<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her exams are very difficult! Essays, short answer plus multiple choice! She uses too many videos because she can't teach. You basically teach yourself the details/contrasts of the various disorders cuz she won't explain them that well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2005<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class not hard, but tricky or &quot;TRICKERY&quot; as Professor Gipson perferred to say.  Test take a lot of preparation.  It can be very difficult to get an A/A- in this class.  Do not let the &quot;easy A&quot; vibe of the class fool you.  You will need to put effort into getting a B.  However, the class and group presentations were very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2005<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class appears simple at first, but it is deceptive, the test are very difficult b/c they focus on small details from the chapter rather than the 'broad topics' that Gipson claims tests consist of; she is very unclear as to what exactly to study. Be aware that this class appears easy b/c of simplistic lectures but it is a struggle to even get B</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2005<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice professor, but she is not very clear at all. I understood the concepts 100%, or at least I thought so before the tests, but somehow I never did quite as well as I had hoped. Tests take a lot of preperation to get even a B--SERIOUSLY!  It is not that the test are super difficult, but she tends to ask random fact that only she would know.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SLIDES! LOTS OF 'EM! MAKES AN INTERESTING SUBJECT DULL! DRY! TECHNICAL! BORING! NO SENSE OF HUMOR! LORD ONLY HOPES SHE'S A BETTER PSYCHOLOGIST THAN TEACHER -- BUT I ****ING DOUBT IT.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is nice and professional. True, she reads off her notes, but it doesn't make her a bad teacher at all. She is very organized and gives outlines notes. She makes sure students understand the class. She grades very fairly and concern with students's needs! Recommended!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The teacher read straight off her notes which were taken more or less directly out of the book. Boring yeah, but easy. You can come to class, read a book, or listen to your i-pod, and it doesn't matter as long as read the chapters and are present for participation. It's easier than philosophy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: PSYCH<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible class.  Definitely not fun and very pointless.  She read everything off of her notes.</div></div></div></body></html>
