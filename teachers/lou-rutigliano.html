Seriously. Before I took this class I was really interested in Journalism, and then I took this class and I hated it. I learned honestly, nothing. He gives 85% on assignments no matter how much time you spend on them.

Incredibly helpful and extremely nice. He's one of those rare young & cool professors. He was always there if you needed extra help on something and would give extensions if you really needed them. Easy grader as well; I definitely did not deserve a B. I was thinking more along the lines of a D. :) Definitely take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2008<br>Class Name: JOUR363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful professor, makes the topic interesting, always willing to help, genuinely cares about students, and he'll cut you some slack when you need it.
