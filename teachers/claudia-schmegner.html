This is grad-level statistics, it's not easy. But she does a great job explaining it, and if you have the strong calc/mathematics background required, you'll do just fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2013<br>Class Name: MAT453<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor. I took the fairly complex MAT 452-453 sequence with Dr. Schmegner. She explained the core content in a clear manner. She was very helpful in addressing questions. I knew several students who switched from another professor's session to attend Dr. Schmegner's. That showed the effectiveness of her teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2013<br>Class Name: MAT201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's so nice. She was very helpful & explains things until you get it. Im horrible at math and I got a B+, no tests except for final & midterm, activities, and a few homework assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was a joke, but she's an ok prof.  Easy grader, will give LOTS of help and guidance if needed (but you shouldn't need it).  Has a pretty strong accent, but its an easy class so it doesn't matter.  All computer work. Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: MAT362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. A very generous grader. Teaches   complex materials well and very prepared. Highly Recommended for future Actuarial Science students. Enjoyable experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does have a slight accent, but lets you leave class when everything is done.  Overall, VERY easy class.  I hate Math and got a 100 on the mid-term!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: MAT451MAT328<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a slight accent, but still quite understandable.  She is not the most exciting teacher, but covers the material well.  She is a VERY generous grader, just try to stay on top of the daily work.  She is very helpful outside of class, when you can get to her office hours.</div></div></div></body></html>
