I'd definitely recommend any of his classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: SOPHSEMINAR<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring teacher, equally boring class. Can be very rude at times by embarassing students in front of class rather than addressing issues after class. Quizzes every week were also annoying. Overall a jerk.</div></div></div></body></html>
