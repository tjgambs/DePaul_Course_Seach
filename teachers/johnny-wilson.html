Professor Wilson is unclear, curt, unwilling to help his students and does not respond to email. His syllabus was completely wrong and the dates are inaccurate, but does not clarify the correct dates. It took a week and a half to respond to my emails and when setting up a meeting, he never showed up for it...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2015<br>Class Name: GAM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is way too into video games. If you are anything but absolutely in love with video games then do not take the class. Expects you to know things that are extremely difficult to find information on, unless there is some library specifically made for everything about Mario kart that I have yet to hear about. Sorry Johnny it's a no from me.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2015<br>Class Name: ISMGAM208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>After the first class I thought it wasn't going to be so bad. The rest of the quarter was horrible and I dreaded taking his class. The massive group project at the end is pointless and just way too much work, on top of the final exam as well. Somehow managed to get an A but it was the worst classprofessor I've ever had at DePaul. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2015<br>Class Name: ISMGAM208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Wow. This is one of the worst professors I've ever had at DePaul. I thought this class would be interesting but it was tedious and dry. You have to write a 30-40 page group paper and I'm still not really sure what I was supposed to learn from it. Johnny himself is rude, arrogant and unclear. He wants to do too many things with this class. AVOID!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2015<br>Class Name: HISTORYOFGAME<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy who has lost of experience in the game industry. 1 Research paper, midterm and final </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2015<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Assumed you had infinite knowledge on the subject matter. Part of the midterm included comparing Spanish conquistadores to medieval chess pieces. Part of the final exam included creating an RPG based on Uncle Tom's Cabin. Tests often had matching portions, but were based on nitty-gritty specifics, as were quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2014<br>Class Name: GAM226<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Johnny is a really cool professor!

But Johnny gives you exactly what you need to do well on the quizzes is very clear about what he expects from projects and is always available to answer questions. Many extra credit opportunities study for the quizzes you''ll do great. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're not interested in games or gaming I would not recommend this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2012<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is absolutely ridiculous. His mid-term, final, quizzes and homework assignments have absolutely nothing to do with the lectures.he's boring, rude, & doesn't replay to emails. If you ask him for help he makes you feel like an idiot.  I only took this class because I was forced to, I would not recommend it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2012<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am a student who generally enjoys school and works hard for good grades. This is the only professor I have ever rated - because I want to advise everyone NOT to take him. Professor Wilson's online class barely pertains to the information presented in his lectures. His homework and quizes never relate, and he is rude and inconsistent with help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was beyond boring. A lot of the students in the class only took it because it was a requirement for DePaul. I give him props for trying to crack jokes but overall, I would avoid taking him. Dry lectures on stupid material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2011<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is like a sick joke, I cannot believe how much he expects from us for a history of games class. Unless you are in with love with the history of games, do NOT take this class with him. I've heard he's good with the other classes he teaches though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>over all Prof Wilson is one of the better profs I have had.  He will help you every step of the way if you just ask him.  I missed two classes due to illness and still got an A.  It's true that the tests/quizes have little or nothing to do with the games you play and learn about, but I only did a moderate amount of studying and I was fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: GAM228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wilson isn't necessarily a great teacher but he's a great person to be teaching the ethics of games, having been the EIC at CGW magazine and being a doctor of religion. Very interesting class if you're into old games, but most of the textbook ethics ideas get lost in the greater discussion. Maybe more of a games class than philosophy. Had fun tho</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT take him.His quizzes are not on material talked about in class, they're on long boring readings that have nothing to do with games.He never answers emails,he was a pretty ok grader until it came to creating a game which he graded mine with a bias because im a girl and I'm sure it was a game he'd never want to play.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him for History of Games. Super nice guy and easy class if you pay the least bit attention. Every week you play jeopardy or play a game. There are small quizzes every week, but they're just on real simple stuff that was talked about the class before. Definitely take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring, waste of time.  Doesn't explain things well at all and never answers your emails.Has in class quizzes based off long boring readings on history, not games.I seriously would of have taken a regular history class if i knew thats how this was going to be. Does offer extra credit tho.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take him for GAM 206.  Its supposed to be on the history of games, but its mostly just history. He expects you to read these long monotonous readings that have nothing to do with games. Class is boring but he always has a quiz or assignment in class so you have to attend. Didnt tell us about midterm until the day before we had it, no m.c.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2010<br>Class Name: IT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's a pretty easy, but very boring class. The exams are not difficult, but you should be able to B.S. on the written portion. The game is kind of fun, but can be confusing at first.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2010<br>Class Name: GAM228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice old guy, tries to make jokes, although voice is kinda monotonous. Very knowledgeable & well-read (& well-connected). Participate and you'll do fine, care and you'll do better. Very understanding. Not one of those crazy profs who can't stand other viewpoints. Jeopardy study method was quite fun. Workload's pretty reasonable. I'd take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: IT228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! He doesn't explain his assignments and refuses to answer question. Never answers emails. He admits there is no way to study for his tests. A 'pop quiz' had a 12 paragraph minimum! He forces his own religious ethics on you, if you don't agree you fail. Do not take if you can avoid it!</div></div></div></body></html>
