    Probably the hottest teacher at Depaul. She's a very good teacher too. I seriouly had trouble focusing in her class becuase she is that hot. Any guy at Depaul should definitely take her

    She's really nice and easy-going in class.  I love that she gives out all of her notes and explains things really clearly.  She definitely wants you to do well in her class...gives extra credit just for coming!  I definitely recommend her.

    Great class, there is a lot of work but it is worth it.  She has no problem with explaining things if you don't understand an assignment. Always willing to go the extra mile if you need it.  Great Teacher!

    I found Pf. Arnott to be very intelligent, fun, and fair.  She knows she is teaching a really boring subject, and she tries her best to make it fun.  The fact that she is drop dead gorgous helps matters!  I found the class to be extremely easy, the lectures are boring, though, but she tries to include lots of activities, highly reccomended

    Hottie!  Takes a very relaxed attitude to homework and tests.  Try to keep up with homework and take notes in class and you should get an 'A'.  Also She is hot and this is good compensation for boring lectures.

    In addition to be gorgeous... she's actually a really good teacher.  I HATE math, and she made the intro course kind of fun, and I actually learned a lot.  She doesn't grade too hard and is reallly understanding if you don't get something, miss a class, turn something in late, etc.  As long as you communicate with her, she's great. =)

    Prof. Arnott is such a nice woman but she def makes it a point to let you know if she does not like you. Very very helpful in explaining material. Does not give any homework and when she does, it's easy as hell! Cheat sheets for both mid terms and finals are allowed to be used! TAKE IT

    This class was very easy, if you think stats classes are easy.  The shortened summer session made it a lot more tolerable, plus she rarely grasded the material.  Just show up to class and get a guarenteed B+/A-

    Need to go to class but she doesn't take attendance. She's very accesible outside of class. SHe can be kind of snappy but overall a good teacher. A good amount of work though
