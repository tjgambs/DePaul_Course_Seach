Essays aren't hard, and she lets you rewrite them. Don't disagree with her because she believes she's always right. But overall easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a good person. However, she was really pushing her opinion on us. She needs to understand that not everybody agrees with what she believes is wrong. Plus, she can't force us to change our point of views.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2013<br>Class Name: PHL290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Rakes is one of the most knowledgable professors that still has passion for what she teaches.  She rarely requires a text, instead she uploads pdfs and essays to read each week.  That way all the material is relevant and on-point.  She's helpful and willing to go over challenging or new concepts until everyone understands. One of the best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2013<br>Class Name: PHL250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is alright. Quite unorganized most of the time. Lots of readings but I just skimmed thru all of them. 3 reflection papers which requires quotes from the readings. 25 hours of service. 1 solo or group presentation (try to get it over with asap) Participation is a big part of the grade so be prepared to say something in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2013<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very rude!  She tries to act very cool and hip, however her way is the only way.  Best way to survive in this class is to simply agree with everything she says and act like it ACTUALLY MATTERS!  Grading is ridiculous and if you like pointless reading guides take the class.  Good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Rakes is caring and supportive. She is passionate and very knowledgeable, this course was one of my favorites at DePaul. I highly recommend her classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2013<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class material was super interesting but Dr. Rakes' teaching methods were not right for me. She is very close-minded and she thinks her opinion is the best and only one. She didn't explain herself and the reading guides were pointless. I will never take another class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2013<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can see how people like this class - if they completely agree with what she is saying. If you oppose her statements at all during class she comes back with an answer that basically leaves you feeling stupid, by the middle of the class the same 3 people are the only ones that raise their voices anymore. I wish she was not so biased in her teaching</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Totally biased, wants to push her own agenda on you. If you disagree, she laughs at you and tries to make you look ignorant. Ignores students that have an opposing view. Her assignments are so full of crap, it's impossible to make sense of anything. I would not recommend taking unless you hate society and want to join in the complaining.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If I hear her say right, or does that make sense one more time I will scream. She is a terribly biased person. She uses this class to get her anger and frustration out, not to actually teach us about child politics. The class should be called Politics of Oppression on anyone who isn't &quot;normal&quot; in Heather's eyes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2011<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very passionate and easy-going teacher. She wants to hear your opinion and tell you about other perspectives. Very easy grader. A few short written quizzes. One group projects on a chapter of the book of your choice. &quot;Take home&quot; final and maybe midterm. She wants you to do well in the class. I would definitely take her again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2011<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a really good teacher and is very passionate about what she teaches. I would recommend her if you really want to learn new things and gain new perspectives on the world we live in. Not a hard grader. Expects you to read and participate a lot. Good at responding to e-mails and helping clarify anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2011<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was extremely one sided. I did not like being called ignorant. There is only one point of view in this class, her's. By the end of the class everyone was so turned off by her, she had to beg us to become involved in discussions. She says &quot;right&#63;&quot; at the end of every other sentence, is a side talker, and uses air quotes way too much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely terrible and biased professor. Avoid if possible!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can understand why some would not like Rakes but she has passion (plenty of it) and knowledge of the material. The material itself is a great reason to take this class. Just make sure you read the material and participate. Good class for Biz Ethics!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2010<br>Class Name: PHI248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are two reasons as to why someone would be upset or confused by this professor: 1) you didn't read the materials or 2) you don't want to see the realities of the world around you.  Excellent for learning how to think for yourself rather than according to the scripts provided in middle school. Refreshing and thought provoking for 2010 ==&gt;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2009<br>Class Name: PHL215<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nothing that comes out of this professors mouth makes any sense. It was a complete waste of my life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very vague, unclear teaching style. Curses frequently to be &quot;hip&quot; and relate to students. Unprofessional bias in course material, being a philosophy class should encourage interpretation, but her views are only ones seen as correct, would even blatantly tell you your view is wrong, and hers is right. Did offer help to some, but would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2009<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice, but very unclear during class.  Really interesting materials and readings, but again, the discussion is difficult b/c she just totally complicates things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2008<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really interesting class.  however, if you come the first day and are not into the topics, you should drop.  participation and reading are key.  that said, if you are struggling heather will go out of her way to help you out.  all she really wants is to know that you are interested and giving it a little though.  i would definitley recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought Heather was incredible. She really makes you question yourself & your beliefs. I learned a great deal in the class & I am looking forward to taking her sometime in the future.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Heather's class!  I can't believe that she got such bad reviews from other students.  She is passionate and intelligent.  There are times when she challenges the class, but only because she is encouraging discussion.  Take her class!  She rocks!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: CLASSSECT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very ambiguous class - dull lectures, loads of homework and uninteresting teacher. I would reccomend it only to people definitly interested in philosophy. Aside from that, my advise to students taking her, would be to catch key concepts, regurgitate them in papers and hope for the best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Heather is really passionate about philosophy, and you can tell by the way she teaches. She may be unclear at times, however, she always makes herself available to help via office hours or emails. She welcomes class participation, and wants to hear from everyone. She maintains respect for her students in the classroom. :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not quite sure wat class every1 else took but I took Heathers ISP 200 class and she was incredible. She promotes class participation so the only way u will fail is if u arent thinking or not showing up. She will challenge ur opinion if she doesnt agree with it, however she is merely trying 2 open ur mind not impose her beliefs on2 her students</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A TERRIBLE TEACHER</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is absolutely worthless. Her grading is hard and she has no idea what she is talking about. This is possibly the most useless class I have taken at DePaul. She is definitely one sided and is unclear about her expectations. Avoid her is you want to learn something new.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER. Possibly the most unfair grader EVER! Her expectations are extremely unclear and her attempt to clarify only makes things worse. Don't bother going for help either because she doesn't even listen, all she does is wait for you to say something she disagrees with and then attacks you. Her class was impossible. DO NOT TAKE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is awful. her grading is really unfair and i have learned nothing in this class. do NOT take this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2007<br>Class Name: SOSEM225<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2007<br>Class Name: SOPH216<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I went into her class feeling ready to take on college.... She turned that feeling into fear, when she mentioned all the reading we were going to do... nine books in ten weeks. I dropped the class the first day. Do not take the class...

As a sophomore I expected to understand the concepts with the aid of a good professor. Clearly only a few years older than I, Rakes is not experienced enough to be teaching concepts of philosophy to college kids. Very unclear and boring; if i were you.. I would drop this class asap</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really didn't like the class, she didn't seem like she knew exactly how to teach it. When class started she just expected us to know something about phl. I dropped the class and am finding a better professor for next quarter!</div></div></div></body></html>
