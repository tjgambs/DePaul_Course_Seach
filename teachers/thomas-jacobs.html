The class is hard as hell but you'll learn more than you can imagine.  Looking back I wish this guy had taught all of my classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2013<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best Professors in the Finance Department.Risk Management is an extremely hard topic,but I would recommend taking it with Jacobs.Given the amount of material covered in this class,he does speak a little fast,but he will repeat himself 4-5 times if students don't grasp something.He is very helpful during office visits too.Curves big time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2013<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Jacobs presents difficult material in the most organized, structured, interactive, and helpful way one could ask for. He manages the class extremely well, and holds his students to a high standard. To me, that's a very good thing, but I'm sure to many that is a problem. Bottom line: if you actually want to learn, take this course with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2013<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most challenging courses at DePaul. Prof J expects his students to work hard as the material is dense. Lots to learn but the material is very interesting. Prof. J is incredibly helpful during office hours and I highly recommend going to see him. Take this course if you want to challenge yourself and learn lots. One of my favorite courses</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2013<br>Class Name: FI362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was one of the most difficult finance classes that I've taken thus far. That being said, Professor Jacobs is extremely helpful, and always willing to help students in and outside of class. He truly cares about his students success- not only in the class but in life after college as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2013<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jacob's class is not easy by any means, but the information is both interesting and useful so it's in any finance student's best interest to suck it up and study hard. Although some may dislike that Jacob's speaks quickly, it allows him to cover a lot and thus provide exceptional value for your money. If you want an easy A, go to community college.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2013<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material in this class is very tough than other Finance classes, however, Professor Jacobs teaches the class very well! He addresses each topic thoroughly and relates real-life events to the lecture. If you pay attention in class, ask questions, and go to his office hours you will be fine. One of the best professors teaching Finance at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2013<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He talks really really fast and runs through difficult material very quickly; he expects it to be a review but for most of us it's not. He doesn't make an effort to make things clear even when you ask questions he still leaves you confused. You can study all you want but the tests are completely different from hw problems and notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2012<br>Class Name: FINCR362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material is a bit dense but also very helpful in business. This professor is also very helpful and I would recommend him to anyone taking this course. He also gives advice for careers in business as it applies to this field. A lot of work but it's well worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2012<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This material is cutting edge, super-high-level finance. It's really, really hard. That said, Jacobs is the most helpful and committed professor I've had at DePaul. The guy is brilliant and will go to any length to help you learn. You'll have to work hard, but it's exactly what college should be. Take this is you want your money's worth.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2012<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Jacobs is a brilliant professor who teaches a very difficult subject matter.The class is a graduate level class, and the material takes a lot of reviewing. Yet Jacobs is ALWAYS available for help and assistance, and he uses real life examples in his class. If you want a challenge that will teach you more than any Depaul class, take Jacobs</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2012<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor, difficult material, yet he will explain absolutely anything you are unsure of.  Book needed for Hw but thats about it.  Strictly lecture, attendance mandatory with Iclicker.  Tests kind of difficult but if you study hard before, you will be fine.  There is a curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2011<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hardest class ever!Was excited about course but he runs through tough material too quickly. Tests&quizzes impossible without reading&doing HW.90% would fail w/out supercurve.participation through Clicker use.Miss 1 clicker question lowers partic. points.Enormous amounts of reading.HW important!very nice guy,won't fail you but you won't retain a lot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2011<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was very hard. He teaches directly off of slides and doesn't give you time to take notes. He is very educated in this topic and is a great help if you simply ask questions. There's a midterm, a final, and a few quizzes which are all impossible, but since there's such a big curve I would absolutely say that it's worth taking this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very smart and does his best to explain things. The material is very hard, so i suggest the more questions you ask the better. Test are extremely hard but he curves his grades</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2011<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty interesting class.  He mostly teaches from slide lectures.  He grades tough so make sure to ask him questions in class.  Otherwise, not a bad guy.  Just study in groups outside of class, do your work, and you'll be fine.  But if you are looking for a blow-off class, not it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Challenging class, but the he's is extremely helpful if you just ask.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2011<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best, most knowledgeable, most responsive profs this humble student has yet known. He doesn't know he's not at MIT. He has forgotten more finance than many others know. It's hard. He's honest on day 1, high work-load. But he responds to Qs instantly and expects of himself the same speed and effort as of us. Excellent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good lectures. A lot of work outside of class. Grades very hard but with a VERY generous curve. Be careful with citations in papers, he will bust you on plagiarism without hesitation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2010<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Jacobs is a smart guy, but he is incapable of teaching. He reads straight out of the powerpoints, and does not elaborate on the topics. He thinks that his students are on the same intellectual level as he is, so his lectures are tough. Tests are impossible, and he is an extremeley tough grader. AVOID HIM, TAKE SOMEONE ELSE.</div></div></div></body></html>
