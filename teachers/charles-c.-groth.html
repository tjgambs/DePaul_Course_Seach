His lectures are disorganized and unclear. People who did all of the homework and studied hard still did poorly on the tests. His tests did not follow a standard math format and were unexpected.

DO NOT TAKE HIM. I had him for Business Stats and he talks a lot about useless theory that doesn't apply to what we are doing in class! I usually do well in my classes but he is bad. Also he takes attendance and if you miss it he drops you by a letter grade which isn't fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay. Charles Groth. This class was an easy topic, and the teacher knew what he was talking about, but his speaking style and speed at which he works are terrible. He takes forever to answer a simple question, so you won't have time to really ask him a complicated question. Regardless, he loves what he does. I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU SIT IN THE FRONT</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a great teacher at all. Doesn't like to help kids out in or out of class. Seems kinda frantic at all times. Homework is online so thats a plus but you won't understand how to do it from his notes. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2012<br>Class Name: MATH095<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Give him a chance, dont be quick to judge. I think he is the best professor I've ever had to teach me math. He explains it all in fine detail until you understand what he is teaching. He doesn't refer to any type of notes and is able to teach accurate info from what he knows. He is highly intelligent and wants to be sure the student succeeds.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2011<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unique guy, which in this world is good, however if you are used to things being given to you do not take him but if you are used to working for everything take him, you will be rewarded.

Thought I'd be okay because I am an A math student, but I am struggling immensely in this class. He's monotone. He also will not argue with the student grader (even if you have the right answer) and doesn't return homework for up to 3 weeks after it's turned in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is not a good teacher whatsoever.  He is more than willing to help you however he cannot teach so even if you go in for help you will not learn anything.  This is a class that will force you to teach yourself and you are screwed if you are confused on anything.  Super nice guy terrible teacher Im an A math student and I struggled immensely</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>don't take this professor.

The teacher lacks ANY teaching skills. He knows the material but doesn?t explain it. He can literally take an hour to tell you that 2 + 2 equals 4.Very unclear and hard to understand.

Just do the homework no matter what!And his teaching assistant sucks too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2009<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. unless you have a death wish or don't want to graduate. explains NOTHING, gives SO MUCH HOMEWORK and is all around not helpful. nice guy, good at math, horrible at teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2009<br>Class Name: MATH95<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Groth is a very reasonable teacher.

He does NOT teach but the three tests are open book/notes so you can learn the material while taking the tests. looks sorta like doc from back to the future and is basically blind and deaf.  dry humor from the 1800s but its fun messing around in class.

Open book, open note, open calculator.  Unless you are slow, or just plain old lazy, you will get an A or a B in this class.  I recommend doing the homework.

I had to teach myself! He is very unclear, he is bad at answering questions. But his handouts do help. Lots of HW.Does not fallow the book.

DO NOT go to his class unless you need to catch up on your sleep.  With that said, he is also one of the easiest teachers when it comes to math. Everything is open book, the tests are fair and he curves it all in the end.

Even though the exams are open notes and book, he does not teach you well enough to apply the material! Homework is not required, but thats the ONLY way you'll learn in this class and he rarely goes over it in. He curves the grades. Will need to put lots of effort just to pass!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>don't take him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I know for 126 the prof's are terrible, but go for someone else.  I got a 100 on the final in 125 so i thought i would be fine despite all the warnings, but take someone else.  Very unclear and when questioned, you are only left more confused. Yes the exams are open everything, but trust me, it doesnt help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was very easy.  He only has two tests and obviously one final exam.  But all three are open note, open book, open whatever.  His explanations aren't very clear and left lots of people wondering.  But if you know how to look through your notes and book, then it should be an easy class to pull off atleast a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher's characteristic are physco and he can't teach.

He reminds me of Doc from Back to the future. He doesnt explain things well, but there are 2 tests and 1 final. The tests are open note, open book, open everything. He reviews the exam before you take it but you pretty much have to teach everything yourself. He also curves a lot, and is a weird dude. Take him if no choice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Always in same clothes, and his humor is a bit off but it's an easy A. Must take good notes and go to class. Only 3 tests and they are easy if you take notes.  He explains in great detail (step by step) when asked, which makes it easy to understand. He does not berate anyone for not knowing an answer or not understanding.  I'd Highly Reccomend Him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, he is boring, but very straightforward.  He does nice reviews before each test.  Even if you never attend class, at least go to the review and you should do fine on the test.  The tests are open book, plus he curves.  No homework either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EASY!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: BASIC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2005<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away.....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I felt like an idiot when I took this class.
