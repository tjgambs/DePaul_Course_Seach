She has an extremely impressive amount of knowledge on migration studies, so her Forced Migrations class was great. She's sweet as can possibly be and quite funny. Class was easy and interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Professor Sharma for INT 206 which could have been an easy/enjoyable class, but the structure of the class was extremely disorganized and so BORING. All she did was lecture and expect everyone to repeat the reading verbatim. Papers were hard and she messed up my grade at the end at it took her over 2 MONTHS to fix. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2010<br>Class Name: ENG280<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very bizarre class setting. Nice lady, genuine person, horrible grading yet easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2008<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The midterm in this class is completely rediculous. It is an abstract from the books you have read and then you are supposed to figure out what book it is&#63; Who is the speaker in the book&#63; What they are talking about and what is the greater signifigance&#63; oh, and it's worth 40% of your grade. Since we never talked about the books in class it was hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2007<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was poorly planned, but with interesting books. Her syllabus is set up so you read about a novel a week, so there is never enough time to discuss the novels as in depth as I think they should be discussed. Also, this way you can get by without having read anything but what you write your paper on and do your project on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2006<br>Class Name: ENG390<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Book choices were excellent.  The one qualm I have with Sharma is her inability to lead a good class discussion.  She tries hard, but if students don't seem interested, instead of moving on to something new she would get frustrated.  I think she makes a better graduate professor than undergraduate.  She appreciates fine quality--good attendence, go</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2006<br>Class Name: ENG469<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Sharma puts literature into social and cultural context which is more than necessary these days! She's laid-back and totally open to students' input. I think the students who have problems with her like rigid class plans and want structure. It's all good if you read and participate which is something that most students don't want to do.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2006<br>Class Name: MODERNBRITLIT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she does grade easily, but i still walked away from her class thinking it was a huge waste of tuition money. i was interested in the class until i started going to it. her choices of novels were decent, but i got more from the book itself than from class &quot;discussions&quot;.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class structure is odd. She will make people do a class project explaining research on a book via annotated bibliography. So you can get by not doing anything but reading the one book you have to for your project. 1 paper, 1 final both very easy. Books are very interesting if you read them, but hardly any time spent on discussion per book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: FILMANDLIT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bizarre combination of strict and easy. Absence and late papers are not tolerated, but grading is ridiculously easy.  Depressingly so, even. The books she chooses are interesting though, if you read them, so I still got something out of the class.  And she is very sweet underneath the initial gruffness.  And I kind of like her accent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2005<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy teacher; very laid back.  read and listen, no need to memorize everything she says. grades easily on papers; only one test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2005<br>Class Name: GRAD<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She must be different with Grad students. She gave a LOT of work/reading and seemed to pull grades out of the air (or somewhere else).  I'd never take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I never read one page of any of the 4 required reading books and got a B+. Just listen in class to her lectures, the tests are so easy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>an easy A, as long as you read the novels, which weren't too tough, and i never read.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2004<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely ridiculous. The class is over and I am still waiting to learn something from this class. Ridiculous grading and overall lack of thought.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2004<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Only read cliff notes, so its so easy to get by doing now work.  She doesn't respond to emails, but her grading is a joke.  I turned in 2 papers that had no quotes and no research and she gave me to A's!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is awesome. you get to watch movies and read novels(or at least cliffnotes). Not too much work involved, and the professor is sooooooooo nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2004<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She gives the impression that she's a real bear, but other than w/her attendance policy, she loosens up as the quarter goes on.  I would take  her again.  Also, I did not read ONE novel throughout the course of the class, so it IS possible to still pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>&quot;Bungling&quot; would be the word to describe her.  You'll learn nothing in the class because you won't be challenged.  Yet, there's plenty of work to keep you busy and annoyed.  I'm sure she knows the subject, but she sure can't teach it to others.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Can skimp on the reading, lots of writing.  Overall fine and not too tough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Comes off like the class will be nearly impossible, but loosens up as the class goes on. Good discussion and very knowledgeable. Not too hard of a class, just one BIG research paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2004<br>Class Name: LITFILM<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Have to do the reading...but a totally reasonable prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2004<br>Class Name: ENG350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ridiculous.  way too much reading (10 books, 10 weeks), and little to no discussion on anything other than the plots of the novels.  the subject was good, but I learned almost nothing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2004<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>took a film and lit class. she's ok, hard to understand sometimes with hard indian accent. absolutely not hot. may be possible to get by without reading the novels.</div></div></div></body></html>
