Prof Dodson knows what she is doing but she explains everything in a monotone voice, and it can get very boring, very fast. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: GD105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just don't take her......She is so monotone and boring. Is always available for help, but she gives projects that she does not give the necessary information to complete. I learned more in my high school design class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: GD105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Dodson can be very monotone, her lectures can be a little boring or repetitive, but it really is a good class. Her class does, like all design and animation, require time and patience. And you really should expect that when taking a class like this. It can be easy and fun if you put forth the time and consider what she is looking for.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2014<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She definitely knows what she is teaching.  I thought it was going to be an easy "A" but turns out I was wrong.  Good thing she is cute because I have little interest in art.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2013<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her basic animation class. She is very precise and is very good at teaching. Don't take her classes is all you want is an easy A. If you want to learn the materials that are used in class, you will find that this prof. is great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: GD105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Dodson is nice and seems to know what she's talking about. She has a very strict attendance policy/late and is a tough grader. However, she does give tons of specific feedback, which was extremely helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: GD105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Spends too much time lecturing about the book and barely enough time to actually learn the software. Grades project based on her definition of creativity. Very dull and unfair class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: GD105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm just going to do you all a favor by telling you to not take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2012<br>Class Name: GD105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The quizzes are easy but if you want a good grade on the projects be ready to spend upwards of 6 hours on each project-& even then she might give you a B just because it wasnt "that creative." She grades projects way too critically for it being an intro class. She is also very boring in her lectures & keeps you until the very last second in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2012<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She takes forever to grade assignments, as well as uses the final week of class to demonstrate things that will not be allowed on the final. There was no in-class final project work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2012<br>Class Name: GD105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof D is a nice person, but her lectures were long-winded, boring,& unhelpful. The focus of the class seemed to be more on animation than on GD. I spent 7hrs to complete each assgnmt. The lectures barely explained how to use the software, but went over basic art terms & concepts. Not to mention she is extremely picky with her grading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2011<br>Class Name: GD105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An okay professor, she will grade everything truthfully though. However the professor does want to make sure that everybody understands everything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: GD000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>More strict than other teachers, but as long as you follow the rules, and dedicate some time for hw, the projects are fun and quizzes easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2011<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Being a very young professor, she is pretty darn talented. Her grading is extremely hard though. I have difficulties with computer softwares so I gotta spend about 4-5 hours for every assignment and I scored a B-. 2 reading summary, and 2 film reviews. At the very least, she is willing to help you outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2011<br>Class Name: ANI151<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible class. Terrible at giving lectures, terrible at criticing work, and a terrible teacher. She taught word for word from the book (Which was painful to read), i could have bought the book and read it myself and saved the money i spent on this class. How did she get this job&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2011<br>Class Name: ANI105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is so boring everyone sleeps, she treats you like your in grade school, tests every week, must attend class, the homework is pretty boring and pointless for me, coming from a 3d animation standpoint.  Id suggest taking someone else if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2011<br>Class Name: ANI105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Comes off as very awkward and holds the image of an elementary teacher. Will go over her pointless rules countless times (such as making you put all your possessions in the corner of the room when taking a quiz) i.e holds no respect or professionalism towards her students. Seems to overcompensate for her sad lectures through useless critiquing</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2011<br>Class Name: ANI105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very tedious and boring lecturer. She is a hard grader, very strict and expects you to follow her many class rules. Although I found the textbook useful her powerpoint lectures were dull and unclear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2011<br>Class Name: ANI105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'll start out by saying, we didn't even finish going over the syllabus in the first class. She tends to go off on long, preachy, unrelated tangents, doesn't seem that skilled in her area, and expects far more than should be expected from an intro class.  In addition, she doesn't allow computers in a class about digital media. Uhm..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For an entry level course, Prof D grades as if this were your senior capstone. Take the time to study and do the assignments well and you might  have a B standing. Her feedback is vague and useless as is her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2011<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HER IF YOU ARE NOT AN ANIMATION MAJOR.  took the non major class and was one of the most time consuming classes ever. save your money and most of all save your time, dont take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2010<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her because it was an intro class, but she is very very hard. She is clear and helpful but there is alot of tedious work. expect about 2-3 hours of work a week. and as the quarter goes on, upwards of 3 hours a week depending on your skills on animation programs. Very Hard Intro class. Would never take it again.</div></div></div></body></html>
