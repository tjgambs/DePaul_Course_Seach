I'd never taken an archaeology class before and she explained the basics  very well.  Her specialty is the African American diaspora.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2009<br>Class Name: ANT324<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Some professors were just born to teach, others work hard at it and get by, yet others should not be allowed near a classroom. This professor belongs in the latter category. Of course this opinion is just as subjective as her grading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a reason some professors get the sad face.  She is very nice but the class is so boring and can't stress it enough.  She grades easy on the papers, quizzes you can take as much as you want, but the final is a different story.  The entire quarter you will be asking yourself &quot;What is going on&#63;&quot; then you'll do terrible on the final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont take this class! BORING BORNING BORING. Quizzes are impossible, papers are boring and pointless. She's really nice, but the lectures will put you to sleep!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2007<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love the topic but the lectures can be boring at times. It's difficult to know what's on the quizzes because sometimes there's a lot of reading material. Overall though, I enjoyed the content/topic enough to make up for the boringness.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2007<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty bad. her lectures have pretty much nothing to do  with the quizzes. boring. if youre not an archaeology major, do not take her. if you are, i'm sure she is great. definitely not worth taking if it is just to fill a history requirement. ghastly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2007<br>Class Name: ANT320<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great topic, and her interest in the material is evident.  But- the readings and her lectures are too difficult to follow.  She asks for honest feedback midquarter and tries to change but by then its a bit late. I really had wished this class would be better. 5 reflection papers, 1 final paper, class discussions make up your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2007<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You would think this would be a pretty easy class, it turn out not at all. She expects you to know everything about the subject, when really very few people had any prior knowledge on it. Her tests are impossible and her lectures are beyond boring, not to mention not helpful, and she says awful awful jokes and side comments. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2006<br>Class Name: ANTH103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very helpful, great course...however some people are just mad because they didnt do well :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had....will ask for feedback and then get mad when you tell her what you think, her quizzes are impossible and she is not willing to help you improve.  very difficult to communicate with and is always rude.  i went to her office hours more than once and everytime she was mean to me and its so boring!!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
