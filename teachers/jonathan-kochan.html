Gets extremely excited about accounting. Relatable and relaxed in class, great at explaining and answering questions. Some people struggled with the tests--you really have to study to do well. All in all, one of my favorite teachers. You do not need to purchase the physical textbook, only the online content (Cengage). </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2014<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice prof ever.
