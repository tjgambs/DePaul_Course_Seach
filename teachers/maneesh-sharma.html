The material itself is boring and difficult to pay attention in class. it would be better if we did more practice problems.  he is a little vague about what he expects for each assignment, but this is more to the students benefit. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2013<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great professor.

No HW, quizzes, or attendance.  Just 2 tests and a paper.  Easiest grader ever.  Bring your laptop to class and sit in the back.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a cool guy, really. The class is just a midterm, final, attendance, and group paper. The midterm and final was confusing because it wasn't what was covered in class but if you just read the book and you'll do fine. The class lecture isn't too helpful though, he sort of reads off the powerpoint...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor! Really intelligent and you can learn a lot form him. The subject is kind of dry, but he makes it interesting with real world examples. midterm, group project and final!
