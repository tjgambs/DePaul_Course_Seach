He takes questions seriously, and he is always willing to help you both in class and out side of class. He makes the homework assignments, which he gives chance to revise them, and they are straight forward. If you do the homework, tests will become not hard. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2015<br>Class Name: MAT215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>He is a tough grader because he wants to make sure students really understand what it is they are learning. He does give good feedback and is very willing to help. There is homework, but the great thing is that you can revise them and get better grades on them. He provides little hints as to what you did wrong and how you can revise it. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2015<br>Class Name: MAT110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible.... Doesn't really tell you what you did wrong and makes simple math confusing. If you don't put exactly what he wants on the homework he has you redo it. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2015<br>Class Name: MAT110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a horrible professor who doesn't care about his students. He has a strange grading system that makes it easy to get low scores and looks for very specific things but doesn't make it clear what he wants. Every class period is a waste and we use time very inefficiently. Cannot warn you enough, DO NOT TAKE HIM. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2014<br>Class Name: 310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible. Makes the hardest math class in undergrad even more miserable.</div></div></div></body></html>
