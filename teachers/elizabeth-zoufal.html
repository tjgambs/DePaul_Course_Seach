    Overall she's great and gives great feedback. However this isn't a breeze through course. Expect a good deal of work that requires effort. Assignments were mostly interesting and easy to complete.  Discussions, journals, video communication, and group work. Just get a good group. Would take her again but she's leaving DePaul after this quarter.

    This class requires too much work and is not worth the time or effort.  STAY AWAY!! Take MKT 376 instead.  You cannot get a perfect score on anything no matter how well you do.  The Professor makes this class more difficult than what it needs to be.  There are quizzes and tests on top of all the presentations and critiques you need to do. RUN!!!!!

    This class is very useful in preparing you for a career, but it is challenging and requires a LOT of work. Beth is knowledgeable and helpful, but I don't think she understands how much time &amp; effort each project requires. She's a tough grader and doesn't give 100s. I spent 5x more time on this class's work than on other classes and barely got an A.

    Its a good class in that it will prepare you for a lot of things later on in your career. That said she is a very tough grader and it feels like she expects everyone to be a professional speaker. Lots of assignments and group work and I don't think she gave 100s or even 90s to anyone despite the hard work we put in.

    TAKE MKT 376 INSTEAD. Took ORGC, dropped it. Filling the same criteria, Mkt 376 is much easier. It's not her, it's the class. Take ORGC if u are good at public speaking and wanna sharpen ur skill thou.

    She is a very nice and friendly teacher. It was a public speaking class, but the speeches are laid back and she helps make you comfortable, and they are not the sole focus of the class. This class is a bit harder than i expected and she does grade kinda tough, but not ridiculous, you have to work to get an A. She is good and i recommend her.

    Sorry Professor Zoufal but I will ruin your surprize. EVERYONE ASK HER IF YOU CAN USE YOUR NOTES FOR THE QUIZ/EXAMS! We learned the hard way. She will let you so ask her in class. If you are afraid of public speaking, then this is the class to take. She will not attack you and break you down like other teachers do. Makes you feel at home. take her!

    She's a sweet and caring teacher clearly interested in what she teaches. She is very understanding when it comes to make-up speeches just so long as you don't try to take advantage of her. Ask for a review sheet for midterm and final which are easy anyway.

    The teacher is super easy. Gives four quizzes, if you do all four you get 10 extra credit and she drops the lowest grade. Quizzes out of 30 points. She lets you use notes for the quiz, eazy A for the class. Most of time not in class because group day working on project for presentation. LOVE THIS CLASS!!!!!!1 TAKE IT IF YOU NEED IT!!!!!!EASY!!!!!!!

    She knows her stuff, but class lectures are boring.  Speeches are not that hard, but require preparation.  Reasoning behind grading is somewhat obscure, but she is not terribly tough grader.  Mid-term and Final (yes, in a performance class) based almost entirely off lectures.  Ask for note sheet, and you can get one.  Very good overrall

    LOVED this professor. She was really nice and dedicated to what she taught. I was terrified of public speaking, but she made it a great experience. Attendance not mandatory but be there to get the notes! Everything she covers is on the midterm and final. FOR THE FINAL-ASK TO USE THE NOTES AND SHE WILL LET YOU! BUT ONLY IF YOU ASK!

    I was initially frightened of this class, but it turned out to be one of my favorites.  Lessons can get dry, but the professor honestly cares if you succeed.  I found Dr. Zoufal to be a caring and intellectual individual.

    she was a really nice teacher, and you could tell she cared about her students. class was fine, and all in all i would take her again, EXCEPT,  her grading policy was really hard. the grading policy does not match the what we were taught. if you take her, be prepared to study hard on your own, or it will catch you by suprise.

    She is a horrible grader!I got points off my midterm,yes,i said written midterm in a PERFORMING class,with no explanations.She takes points off of speeches,critiques as she wishes with no reasoning behind it,one would think she would clarify why you got points off so you can prevent it on the next speech right&#63;WRONG!Lets not forget the chicken pox!

    You need to know A LOT for the exams, so be prepared to study for those two.  The speeches aren't very tough, but towards the end you are giving one every other week.  She isn't specific on why she took points off so it is hard to improve your grade.  She is nice and helpful if you need help.

    The lady is so nice but man. she is crazy hard. extremely uncleear with expectations so it's hard to improve on next grade. She wants very technical and specific vocabulary and quite demanding on exams. If you take her, you should pay TOO much on detail to get an A.

    Where to begin.  I mean, she knows her stuff, but I hate her class.  She tries to keep us active, but I just never felt interested.  Before taking this class I was pretty excited for it because I would think that there would be more talking, communicating, blah, blah, blah, but there isn't.  She talk, she lectures, and that's pretty much. So so!
