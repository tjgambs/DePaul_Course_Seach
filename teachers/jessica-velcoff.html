She's very very nice and approachable if you had any questions. It's mainly powerpoints everyday w/ note taking. but if you study the notes, the midterm, final, and reflection papers are a breeze! Not a hard/bad class at all! Really enjoyed it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2008<br>Class Name: PSYPSY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have had Prof. Velcoff for three classes now, and she is AMAZING! She is very understanding and she has a lot of knowledge in the field she is working in. I highly recommend this teacher! She expects a lot out of her students, but that is what higher education is about. It's really not too difficult to get a good grade, you do need to study some.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2008<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed her class. She was clear and pretty easy if you were on top of your homework. You have all semester to write the 10 page final and you basically use everything you learn from class to write it. She could be a little more confident in her responses but I think it b/c she's a fairly new teacher. Give her a break. Overall fun. Got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT take her for Statistics if you have NEVER taken Stats before or you will be extremely confused.  Her slides were rather confusing at times and she often had to correct herself, especially when students would correct a problem.  She is a good teacher but not great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>professor made it difficult to get anything out of the course.she is rude to students and cant answer ANY questions without saying &quot;um,I'm not sure,I'll have to look into that&quot;.Dont bother,you wont get your moneys worth.she will frusterate you!too bad, because the course topic had potential.Oh, and she gives us a 10 PAGE FINAL PAPER AND FINAL EXAM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2007<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Complete homework assignments and attend class and it's an easy A. Her chapter outlines are extremely helpful and cover everything in her exams. In addition, both the midterm and final have a multiple close book portion and a open book portion for calculations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2007<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It isn't that she's a bad teacher persay, it's mroe like she doesn't know what she is doing.  She gets a lot of her own questions wrong and the lectures can be really confusing.  But the homework is easy and she hands out outlines before all the lectures so you know what to take notes on.  And she's pretty willing to help you if you need it.</div></div></div></body></html>
