All the powerpoints are on blackboard, but you should still take notes in class. She makes it really interesting. There is a really easy research paper 3-4 pages (you read a psychology journal and write basically a summary)There are 3 exams. Non-cumulative.She's just really awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely helpful.
