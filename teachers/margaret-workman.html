All the powerpoints she presented were put on D2L so you didn't need to take notes, but the final exam was a little tough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2014<br>Class Name: ENV204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this as a SI nonlab requirement because it sounded easy & it is if u do the simple work. Weekly quizzes are open book on D2L & the midterm & final are take home. Shes really nice & grades pretty easy. We do inclass activities every week that are fun & educational. Im surprised that this required class ended up being 1 of my favs this quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2010<br>Class Name: ENV204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took ENV204 and ENV200 with Workman.  She is very interested in what she teaches.  Energy can seem very bland but she gets students engaged in fun experiments.  All she cares about is if you tried your hardest.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2010<br>Class Name: ENV204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher! So nice. Easy grader. Just do the work, go to class and you will most likely get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2010<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i dont know what everyone below is talking about. This professor is extremely nice and helpful. She cares about her students and wants them to do well. The lectures are a bit dull and boring at times, but hey thats any class. Class is fairly easy and there are no quizzes. Just midterm, final, and paper. definitely recommend this professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is definitely not an easy A. There is a lot of busy work. There is a quiz almost every class, but the quizzes are fairly easy.  The midterm and final were much harder than I expected, and reviewing the study guides is definitely not enough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Constant busy work, quiz almost every class period.  I thought the midterm and final would be really easy, but they weren't as easy as I thought.  Attendance is mandatory and the class is the most boring class to sit through... I guess it could have been a lot worse but don't take this class unless if you HAVE to...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2008<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm guessing the posting defending the professor has to be the horrible TA. This class is so much busy work its ridiculous. This professor requires you to come to EVERY class and marks points off for the stupidest stuff on labs and assignments. You take a quiz every class and have a hw assignment. If you have a life, don't take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a ****, she gave me a B+. This is the most boring, useless,  and juvenile class I have ever taken. She will lecture to the class like they are 8yr olds, cause she herself, has the mentality of an 8yr old. Do every assignment, attend every mind-numbing lecture, and study for the exams, you will at least get an A-. Tons of busy work! Do not take</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice, but this class is quite boring. She could (& has) talk the whole 3 hr lecture! But the hw is really easy, she stays on schedule and midterm isn't bad if you go to class and study. Not too much work, but you do have to go to class. I like her, there are no surprises. so yea, take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2006<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy&#63; YES Complete waste of my time&#63; YES Professor Workman's class is mind-numbingly easy. I would not recommend taking it, unless you had the intellect of a 4th grader. It was by far the longest 3 hours of the week... bring a crossword and you'll still get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy teacher. She is very passionate about the subject, i wish i could say the same. It is an easy A, just do the assignments which can be found easily in the book and you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is very dull and boring. Because it is so easy, you will get frustrated. You study the same stuff you did in high school. But Workman is very passionate about the subject and tries to evoke that interest in her students. Too bad it doesn't happen but I got to admire her for trying. You can easily get a good grade so it's a good GPA boost.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So easy to get an A.  Just do your shi*, which is easy as anything, and study a little for the midterm and final and you'll ace it.  Highly recommend her--very nice and laidback.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I felt like this class was a waste of time, but I also HATE math.  She seemed very distant and unable to enthuise the class, although she tried hard and was extremely kind. The exams and the project count a lot so make sure you put in the effort.  The rest of the class is kind of a  blow off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought this would be an easy class but the exams are hard if you dont study alot. She is very nice but the lectures were a little boring. Not too much homework! The in class movies were awful but showed up on the test</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Workman's class seems easy enough, but it's a complete waste of time -- not to mention frustrating!  Silly &quot;homework&quot; packets, non-stop powerpoint slides, and even a group project (!) to make a tri-fold display board (!) are found in this class.  Dull, dull, dull.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Homeworks and classwork are graded very easy (just checks). 1 paper/1 presentation. She writes the exams - they are harder than one might expect.  A good prof. to take for Quantitative Reasoning.  She is very nice and forgiving.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is super easy if you just need to fill a math requirement. I highly recommend...just show up to class and turn in all your work.  Its great. Also, she is very nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2004<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring lectures, homework that is like busy work, tests that are crammed with info, a book I never even used.. This class was terrible.  She's a nice lady, just not cut out to be a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nearly no homework. lectures&#63; i sat next to a friend and we talked the entire time and still got an a.  helps you if you need it.  very nice, and very small.  her stature and voice remind me of a mouse.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2004<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the best professors that I have taken here at DePaul.  She is very knowledgable and informative. She is down to earth and respects our opinions.  My friends and I liked her so much that we also took ENV 202. I strongly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2004<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice and does not grade too hard.
