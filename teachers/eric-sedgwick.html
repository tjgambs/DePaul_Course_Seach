The final exam was fairly easy to pass ..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: CSC401<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: Rather not say</div><div id="right"><div>What can I say? This guy loves his work. Just enough coolness to inspire, but sincerely interested in student success. I emerged from his class an enlightened student. He painstakingly takes you through the steps, but doesn't expect you to absorb it all at once. Hits the important stuff in earnest. Whatever the course, this guy is the best choice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2014<br>Class Name: CSC401<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best teachers I've had so far. His lectures are well structured, and he covers material thoroughly.  I've never taken a programming class before this, and he made it very understandable. Highly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2014<br>Class Name: CSC401<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher!!
