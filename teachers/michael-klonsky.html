TO get a good grade- you have to be able to write papers that he agrees with. He's very subjective and too far to the left side and radical too</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2011<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is in tune with what is going on in the Chicago public schools.  He's taught for many years in them, regularly monitors issues affecting education and shares the matter with his students.  Great class to share discussion topics facing our education system.  He's humorous.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2010<br>Class Name: SOC408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brilliant, committed to social change.
