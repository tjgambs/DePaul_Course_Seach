    I took her class on Italian food, and it was so boring! A lot of readings, boring lectures, just not a lot of fun. She refuses to give a grade higher than a 94% on papers but won't offer ways to improve. Really made me frustrated. She's a lovely person but I will never take her as a professor again.

    Prof. Marchi is a wonderful teacher. She made my LSP 112 class so interesting! Plus, she was always there to help if I needed anything. She's really sweet; I definitely recommend.

    Lucia is the cutest Italian lady! She makes class fun by showing us Italian videos or taking us to the SAC for casual conversation (in Italian of course.)  Homework and quizzes are easy if you  pay attention in class and study moderately.

    Lucia is the cutest lady. It is definitely a more difficult class because she usually talks only in Italian. If you don't understand something though, she does everything she can to help you. Overall, if you pay attention in class, it isn't that hard. She always has exercises, that are sometimes boring, but they really help you learn the material.

    Really nice lady but pretty boring professor. I took her in the late afternoon and it was hard to keep a lot of the students interested. Easy A if you do the homework, pay attention, and go to class.

    Adorable! I loved Lucia as my 101 professor. It is a language class, so I recommend going to all the classes, but I don't think she is too hard on you if you miss a couple. She has a great sense of humor and is really helpful. Quizzes are exactly what you go over in class and final was harder than expected w/out studying. take her!
