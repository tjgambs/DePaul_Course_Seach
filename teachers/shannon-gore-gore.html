The video clips are fun tho. most of the grade depends on the two exams. The way that the exams are formatted makes them more difficult than the material that is being tested.  But she is an okay teacher for a class that is required.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2013<br>Class Name: COMM175<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not engaging and boring. She doesn't show interest in what the students have to say. Although the class is super easy, barely any effort to get an A but not worth the teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2012<br>Class Name: COMM175<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I adore her! There is a lot of discussion based on movies and clips she shows. She assigns reading but its really small amounts and easy to manage. Tests and quizzes are easy, she always gives really helpful study guides. I love this class. Easily my favorite. Im minoring in communications now because of her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: ART179<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>well,is not a interesting class, but is require,she is patient, no homework require,test score is the biggest and the main,as long as style the book, it should be ok</div></div></div></body></html>
