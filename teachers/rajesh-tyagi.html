Six Online quizzes (drops lowest grade).  Midterm and Final allow one sheet (front and back) of notes.  Presentation/Research project on a new product. Participation/Attendance is 25% of grade.  Show up to class, speak a little bit and you will be fine.

He doesn't teach a single thing You have to do a lot of the teaching yourself Might as well buy the book & read it at home instead of attending classses You can't understand what he says & the he goes through the powerpoints too fast The tests don't correlate w/the material becuz he doesn't teach the problems Project is hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2007<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy is awesome.  gave us a day off during midterm week.  very helpful in class but doesnt reply to emails.  mgt professors are pretty easy (except daly) and this guy is the same.  personally, u gota be an idiot to fail this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Got a B without much effort.

What makes it even harder is the professor. You have to most of time teach yourself. He is an okay professor, if I had a choice to choose someone else to teach i would choose others. . Final and midterm are hard. I ended up with a B, even thought I tried hard trying to keep it to an B. Take him only if you want to teach yourself</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2007<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Tyagi is not that bad.  He is kind of funny, and knows his stuff like the back of his hand.  Though you can't miss class because hes really big on attendance, if you speak in class, he will love you.  His exams are manageable, quizzes are open book, gives you a cheat sheet for the exams, and gives you extra credit opportunities.  Take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2007<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hes been using the same syllabus and coursework for the past 10 years, not very keen on his efforts as a professor. abuses power as a professor and plays favorites. take him if you want to be screwed</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2007<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was little skeptical when I first sign up for his class because of all the comments people left on rate my professor but he is not hard actually it was easist class I took this spring...Midterm and project and few online quizes thats it and you do good on midterm and project you will at A.

I however had 2 freeloaders in my group and ended up do an unreasonable amount of work. Only 2 people were able to complete the midterm in the time alloted. Teacher is not good at explaining expectations.  no good!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2006<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All this comments are not right, in some point may be right but overall this is the easiest class you can take.
