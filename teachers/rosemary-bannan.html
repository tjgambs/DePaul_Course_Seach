Writes illegible words on the board that are irrelavant to class material. Makes you buy a huge stack of papers as your workbook-its pretty out of date. All of this work only counts as participation.

Don't be fooled, it's all  text based. You're marked absent even if you're in seat seconds after she calls your name. Completely ambiguous for homework & other outside assignments. Gets lost in her own discussions. Uses old & out of date material. My advice: run.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2007<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just doesn't seem with it, gets frustrated at questions, zero passion for the subject</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a  terrible waste of money and my time!! It seems harsh, but most comments here are true. Her teaching style was awful- unhelpful & rude. Its not her age- there are great older prof- she was just very STALE and showed no interest in stimulating her class. Also, you get stack of old articles that sheâ€™s been using for years!! Very BAD!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I read the reviews on here when I still had time to change classes but took the class anyway because I thought maybe the reviewers were just stupid. WRONG! If you are reading this while you still have time GET OUT OF THIS CLASS NOW!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She writes random words on the board that she pulls out of the chapter but talks about things that are completely related. If you try to ask her a question or argue a point she doesn't understand the question and then gets frustrated at you because she is senile. She is completely unorganized and assignes pointless papers that have little to do wit</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2006<br>Class Name: SOCLAW<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Disorganized-- syllabus changed constantly. When students asked for clarification, Banan seemed to take offense. Also, we sat in alphabetical order and read outloud while sitting in a circle... it was like grade school all over again. Students were also unclear about what she wanted in our papers and &quot;presentations&quot; (reading our papers outloud).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2006<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This lady shouldn't be allowed to teach.  She couldn't even put a tape into a VCR--honest to God it took her almost 2 minutes to find where it goes.  She also messed up my grade b/c she told us that we could not take the final if we could show her we deserve the A.  She told me I'd get an A and then gave me a B-.  She completely ruined Soc for me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i almost feel bad for her because she's on the older side. I don't think it's really her fault that shes not very good, i just think shes getting too old to teach. Shes very unorganized and her reviews for tests are handwritten by her, and squeezed onto one page, i mean she can't even type her review! not tomention u can't even read it!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2005<br>Class Name: LAWSOCIETY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst classes I have taken here at DePaul.

She is not a little nice old lady like everyone says. Don't go to her office hours either because she is rude, crabby, and a total ****. Her review sheets are a JOKE and so are her tests. She claims to constantly be sooo busy when she uses the same curriculum every year and her tests are scan tron. DO NOT TAKE THIS ****'S CLASS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2005<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher was a complete idiot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was boring and a waste of time. a nice lady, but her lectures were pointless and her handwriting unreadable. the review sheets were a joke. i would advise to move on and find another class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2005<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate this professor with a passion. I hate that I took her and that I paid for this class. She can't teach, she doesn't makes sense, she is rude, and she talks about China too much. Last time I check this was America. Don't take her if you don't have to. I'm hoping that after she reads her evaluations she'll retire. I made sure she got a bad one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, I have nothing good to say about this professor. If you take her class be warned: you will get bored to death and you will learn NOTHING! She made what should have been an interesting subject into an hour of torture. Bannan has to be at least 75 yrs old; she should not be teaching. Only take her if you absolutely have to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2005<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she needs to just retire! she is so old and she does not make any sense when she teaches... i'm getting angry just talking about it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2005<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, Managable reading load.  She's alright if you get a chance to talk to her outside of class.  Oh yeah, she forgot about our final exam schedule, but was nice enough to let us take it or just double our midterm grade. I took the test and got a letter grade higher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2005<br>Class Name: SOCIALJUSTICE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: SOC208<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was nice, old, lady. Never dotted i's or crossed t's. Lectures were exciting maybe for her. Oh yeah, she did not show up for her final exam on St.Patys Day, a day B4 spring break pissing off the entire class. She said we could take it the next day or redo th final.

She expected people to read and do the paragraphs. Her material helped me progress in my ideas about culture.

You really do not even need to purchase the book. Just borrow it from someone else to copy the key terms, which is what both the midterm and final are made up of.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2004<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While Prof Bannan is insanely old and seems crazy at times, and usually does not make sense, the class is REALLY easy. Don't be afraid of her, just show up, you dont even always have to do the readings. I got an A without doing much work.
