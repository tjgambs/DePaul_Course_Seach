He's very intelligent, nice, helpful, and a fair grader. You will learn a lot from his class. Midterm and final exams are closed books. Most of the questions are from class material, homework, and a few are from some readings he assigns. He talks a little fast but still understandable. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2011<br>Class Name: TDC563<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tony is a great teacher.

I've been in the telcomm world for 8 years, and after leaving his classroom I found myself with knowledge of WHY things work the way they do and not just the how. Very helpful in my career and I look forward to TDC577 with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2009<br>Class Name: TDC463<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty intense course but if you know youre stuff it shouldnt be that hard. he was a fair teacher and always answered questions via email quickly. fair amount of work done usual assignments, 2 labs, midterm, and final. id take im again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2008<br>Class Name: TDC577<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The only lecture of any value was the last one, when he had a guest lecturer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2007<br>Class Name: TDC477<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher!

He knows what he is talking about but you can surely tell he is all academic.  I only assume this after noticing he is teaching material the work force hasnt used for ages.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2005<br>Class Name: TDC365<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Professor, Takes time to explain everything in detail. Does not move on until people understand. Takes the time to answer individual questions.</div></div></div></body></html>
