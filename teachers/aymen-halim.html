Aside from being so passionate and knowledgeable about the subject, he was very organized. Aymen always graded assignments quickly, and gave thoughtful and helpful feedback that really helped develop my writing. Aymen always made students feel that their thoughts and opinions were valuable! A++</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: IWS327<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Aymen is a great professor. He's very motivating and makes students challenge themselves. He gives students both individual and group attention. You can tell he really loves teaching. I've learned so much about the media taking his class and am definitely going to take his other classes in the future!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: IWS327<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is straight forward. About 5 news articles/week, write a 3 page response, midterm paper, final is either a creative project or research paper. You learn a lot about media theories that I never really thought about before. Everything I learned in this class helped me with my other classes. It's a very broad topic and he broke it down so well!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2013<br>Class Name: IWS327<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Aymen is a extraordinary at what he does.  He gives students a visualization on how the media portrays certain ethnic and religious groups, and how this affects our society today.  I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in learning something that relates to every day life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2013<br>Class Name: IWS327<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I have ever had at DePaul. Aymen is extremely passionate and that showed in class. Topics were always interesting and whenever something was unclear or I needed help he was more than willing to meet outside of class. We need more professors like Aymen!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: IWS327<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has a vast amount of knowledge and is always open to learning more/being corrected from his students. His class structure was easy to follow and he was always willing to help even if it was outside his office hours. I learned a lot in his class, and hope to have him as a professor again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: IWS327<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Aymen is very passionate about the subject he teaches. He has an awesome personality and is down to earth! The work load in the class is not bad. I learned a lot and really enjoyed coming to class! DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CLASS!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: IWS327<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really knows his stuff! He's very passionate about what he teaches. I learned more about Islam and/or Media in his 10-week class than watching the news my whole life. I highly recommend him, and his class should be mandatory for people going in to media studies.</div></div></div></body></html>
