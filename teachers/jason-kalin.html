He adds "right?" to the end of every sentence, occasionally pauses to make this weird groaning sound, and treats the students like 8th graders. The projects are dull, but there are no tests and if you do assignments to the letter, you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2014<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>+ Nice guy, easygoing  + There to help (if you ask)  + Manageable workload  - An academic: learn  teach.

Assignments were more convoluted than they needed to be.  He gives good feedback on writing but I really wouldn't recommend this class unless you're a fan of group essays.</div></div></div></body></html>
