I wish more teachers were like him, someone that understands what a teachers roll really is all about. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: MGT562<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>After completing my MBA, I can say that Rocky's conflict resolution course was among the best classes I took at DePaul. There's something for everyone to learn. His teaching style is engaging and makes it easy to participate. The mock mediations are a tremendous learning experience. Overall: low stress + you learn a ton.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2014<br>Class Name: SPORTSLAW<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Rocky is great and he knows his stuff. Fair grader, sometimes dry presentations, but he does his best to incorporate multimedia. Four short papers & a take-home final exam (essay questions). Told us on the first day that we didn't need to buy the book as long as we attended class. Interesting MGT elective that is worth taking. An easy A if you try.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2014<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I was very excited about this course and quickly became very disappointed.   Rocky's teaching enthusiasm was wanting. His organization and AV usage was downright awful.    The books were outstanding however.    This course has amazing potential if a new professor breathes some life into it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You wil not be disappointed with Rocky - he's an amazing instructor and a subject matter expert.  He brings a wealth of legal experience to the table and can explain complicated HR issues with ease.  I highly recommend him as a professor, but he's also just an all-around fun guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2011<br>Class Name: MGMT565<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned the most from this class than in my whole MNA.  Passion for teaching and ensuring students can use the material outside the classroom! DePaul needs more Rockys!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: MGT562<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simply one of the best professors in all of Depaul. Very humble, witty and never comes across as arrogant. Guy is honest and considerate of his students. A definite class act. I recommend big time</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2010<br>Class Name: MGT565<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Professor!  Assignments are relavant and he uses real life stories to illustrate his points.  I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2009<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i always buy the books for class even if all ratemyproffessor comments say not to bc i usually use it. however im telling you now DONT BUY THE BOOK. every test question comes DIRECTLY from his ppt slides. i read all the chpts for this class and it didnt help at all. class is interesting and rocky has awesome stories. midterm, final, group project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof with great stories to illustrate what he's teaching. I will agree the midterm is kind of rough- study the slides carefully and thoroughly. He's a lawyer, so write your assignments clearly and be sure you explain all your points well. Class is usually fun and he loves participation and questions. Group project at the end is not difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although he explained everything clear, the exam wasn't as what he said. It was totally different. Before that, my G.P.A. was 3.90 then after his clas, my G.P.A. was falling! Find another prof. if you want grade A instead of C.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Why you all said that he is good which is absolutely not!!!

Excellent Professor. Makes the class very interesting. Minimum workload...(the most time consuming is the take home final which shudnt take more than a day). Very easy grader. MUST TAKE!!! you will definitely learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Conflict resolution class was beneficial. It put things in a different perspective for me. Course work was not difficult. Just show up to class and pay attention. There is some reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most ICS classes are BS. However, his conflict resolution class really developed some life skills for myself. Course load is pretty easy, along with Rocky as a grader. Though he does take attendance and figures that into his grade. Take this class, its worth the time, money and minimal effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2005<br>Class Name: MGT565<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is fun, and energetic.  Really knows his stuff.  Makes a 3-hour class go by pretty quickly.  One note, though-he has TOO many powerpoint slides.  Don't try to print them out.  Just study off of them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2004<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher, lets us watch &quot;everybody loves raymond' had him for the conflict seminar, great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2004<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very egotistical, but it seems to work with his teaching style. Has a lot of experience in business that he brings to the classroom. Teaches the negotiation class as well - it's really good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2004<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
