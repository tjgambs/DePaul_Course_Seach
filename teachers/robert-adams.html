No lesson plan. Had us read quotes from Colin Powell the first class, then we left. Cancelled three out of ten classes. Except for one class when he showed a video the whole class time, we never stayed longer than 1.5 hours. If you are in college to learn, avoid Adams like the plague. Absolute complete waste of time and money</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST PROFESSOR EVER!!! doesnt teach anything, shows a lot of videos, and just so arrogant and incompetent. he yelled at me in front of the entire class for going to the bathroom. so if ur in his class, and u have to step out for a minute, sucks for you. he'll single you out. picks favorites and doesnt know what hes talking about.just ugh!fire him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: INT206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Adams grows on you, but I couldn't help but feeling that he is just super LAZY.  He required group presentations (where the group presented ALL the material) and he just skims over your papers after a student grades them.  This prof. is also VERY unclear, so make sure and ask him what he wants, multiple times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2007<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's Great!!! He's helpful and knows so much...I like the way he talks. Plus he can be very funny at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He absolutely has to be the Worst teacher ever. NEVER helps with anything, doesn't care about his students. Extremely arrogant and annoying. His Classes are very disorganized, changes the syllabus at the last minute. What a waste of time! DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSES! YOU WILL REGRET IT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yeah,you know,i mean,That's how he talks. He's the WORST &quot;teacher&quot; i have ever had in my life. He doesn't help students with any of their work. Makes you write tons of papers that he DOES NOT even grade himself, has other students grade them for him. Doesn't care that students have other classes too. Prepare to spend 10 hours/week for his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2007<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid if you can. Unnecessarily arrogant...not helpful at all. Appears to have no idea what he's talking about during class discussions. Not the worst, but very, very far from the best. If you take him, you better read and be one step ahead of him the whole time...otherwise, he'll make you feel like an idiot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2007<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Adams sucks at being a professor. We had to write an unnecessary amount of papers and still haven't gotten all of them back. Here is an example of how big of an a** he is: if you miss more than 2 days of class he either drops you or gives you and F. AVOID ADAMS!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2007<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the most terrible human on the planet.  If you have to take his class, you must stay on his good side.  Once on his bad side, he has no problem embarrassing people in front of the entire class just to show that he is &quot;the professor&quot;.  Do not question his authority...he does not like that.  He is evil</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2007<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Adams is on a power trip that he really needs to come down from. Really heavy work load: a paper, &quot;presentation strategy&quot;, and presentation due every monday. He is unagreeable about everything and makes you feel like you know nothing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2007<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very interesting professor. Sometimes very hard to understand...make sure you understand what the homework asignment requires you to do because if it is not clear and you make a mistake you will be at fault. He is very intelligent and helpful. I even go to him for suggestions and ideas for assignments in my other classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2006<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Adams is funny, nice relaxed.  However, if you are looking for an unorthodox professor (typical of DePaul and the political left) this is not the prof for you.  As long as you are an OK writer and you read the material for all the assignments, there is no reason why you shouldn't get an A.  Warning:INT 201 very disorganized and you WILL be at fault</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2006<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's the cutest guy there is! soooooo smart and funny!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2006<br>Class Name: ISP105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, great teacher! Very knowledgable on international issues, events, history, etc. The ISP 200 class itself wasn't anything I wanted to take, so I'm glad at least that I got him as a teacher. He usually teaches INT and ANT courses, and I am looking forward to taking him for those in the future. Highly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2006<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yeeaa...you kno...yeaaa...Really great teacher, has such a passion for teaching and learning.  Loves to talk about current affairs and in class debates. A great guy and a great teacher, but be prepared to work hard.</div></div></div></body></html>
