One homework ass/wk. One in-class lab/wk. Mid-term, final, and final website. Going in, I had no knowledge abt this stuff, but Ibarra made it unbelievably simple to understand and possible to do. Easy class, an immeasurably great professor. Take him if know nothing about HTML/JAVA.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2010<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy's great. Passionate about what he does, cares about his students, and takes individual skill levels into account. I missed a whole bunch of days due to stuff that was going on in my personal life and he was very, very understanding. Great guy, I'd take him again in an instant. Has a cute accent, kinda. =)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2010<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Ibarra is really nice guy. His willing to help you on whatever your confused in. The lectures will put you to sleep. My only con however is the exams. We get too many questions in such a short time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is easy. But he will put you to sleep. Other than that he's pretty cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2009<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! The class isn't bad and he is very good at explaining stuff.  Exams are easy but very long. Assignments are easy and he is a very fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2008<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a good teacher.  I would definitely recommend him.  A lot of lecturing, but I didn't even buy the book and did fine.  Very willing to help you too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2008<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simple teacher. Classes are quite dry, but he is more than willing to help if you need it before or after class. Nothing good or bad to say about this class, but do not take it if you are HTML/CSS/JavaScript literate because you will be bored and irritated when he messes up coding and cannot figure out the problem with his web page.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2007<br>Class Name: CSC396<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is pretty easy, generous and very helpful. Lots of homework but they help you do well on exams. Midterm requires lots of memorization. Good thing, final was open book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A good professor. He explains the topics well. My only complaint is that sometimes the homework is a bit much or overly complicated. But he's a pretty easy grader. He packed a lot into the midterm but it wasn't really difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2006<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Weekly powerpoints that you need to print out.  Class is easy. Homework is kinda tough if you dont know what you are doing.  Very helpful and generous.  Mid-term and final were based on homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2006<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of powerpoint which you need to print out each class or you will be writing a whole lot. Confusing, but willing to re-explain topics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2006<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found this class to be easy enough. The teacher is a nice guy, kind of quiet. Powerpoints each week, covers a good deal of material but explains it better than the textbook, which seemed like a rip off at $90-100 but was very informative. Good class. Easy, easy, EASY language (Java).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: JAVA<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He wears the same purple and green shirt several times a week.  Very helpful, but doesn't explain things in normal english (I guess he's been in academia too long) Lots of work, but is very lenient.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2005<br>Class Name: CSC321<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, not that bad of a prof. I have had worse, but I have also had better. He is pretty average.</div></div></div></body></html>
