Her lectures are boring, but the subject is just boring. She gets papers back in a timely manner and meets with every student. She really cares about making you a better writer. Definitely take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2013<br>Class Name: WRD203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bowden's a great professor. She can be a bit unclear at times, but she's extremely fair and intelligent. If you find yourself taking her class, don't be surprised if you walk away with an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: WRD540<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bowden is possibly the most intelligent writer and instructor at DePaul, and I've worked with many of the senior faculty in ENG and WRD for my Master's. Her class isn't the showy lecturefest that undergradbots crave, but you will rarely encounter a professor who thinks and cares more about writers and writing than she does. She's the real deal.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: WRD203<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Darsie is a nice lady, but her class is a wreck and pointless. She will ask you to buy like 4 books, DON'T do it. You don't need them, save your $. If you are impatient like myself, take another class. It's a drag to show up to her class. Nice lady but terrible at teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2011<br>Class Name: ENG473<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This goes back a couple of years but DarDar was a train wreck. She thinks writing is teaching - and if you write for entertainment, science, politics, or literature you are a heretic. She is more pathetic than predictable but more blah than pathetic. Take anyone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Bowden is really knowledgable and enthusiastic about writing. She gives clear reviews of your work and really tells you how to make it the best. great professor. take her if you have the chance, really helpful especially for freshman writing</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super lenient when it comes to turning things in late as long as you don't give a long drawn-out story about while it's late. Gives really good feedback on homework. Leaves room for variation when choosing paper topics. Very open and unbiased I had her during the election and couldn't tell what party she was at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was such a good teacher and so helpful.

Championing the plights of underclass illiterates she looks for no solutions only opportunities to moralize and be a know-it-all.  She plays favorites and gave me a bum grade because the woman I had to tutor never bothered showing up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mrs. Bowden was the first class I ever went to in college and she made my first class great.  She was incredibly helpful and understanding about attendance and paper mishaps and also explains things well.  Some of the assignments can be boring, but for the most part the papers were fun.  I'd highly recommend her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: ENG377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class wasn't too difficult but it is a big time commitment (service aspect)... assignments were not overly difficult and she tries to get the students to be actively involved in class. i think that person at the bottom whose brain &quot;rotted&quot; is a complete moron, as demonstrated by their typing/spelling abilities. bowden is a fine prof and i woul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: ENG395<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the writing center course is alot of work but shes such an easy grader as long as she sees youre trying. the lecture/discussion is dry, boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: TIANSQUAREFP<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: ENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pessimistic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was one of the more horribly boring classes i've taken in my life. She made us write our reations to stupid scenarios, like &quot;what would you do if you lived in a developement and they wanted to put in a golf course that rant hru your main road&quot;. What&#63; I'm dumber for being in that class...i think my brina rotted.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>English 103 sucks, but Darsie rocks!  I went to her for help a few times, and she was willing to talk to me about the assignments.  Some of the assignments were a little dull, but she helped me become a better writer.  I did not think that I would like the class, but I did.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Darsie is great.  The second best professor i have ever had.  i would most definately take her again.  Class is kind of early, but her assignments are pretty easy.  Her grading system rocks.  And all around genuinely a great professor.  Very informative and will help your writing skills.  Take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bowden was a very nice teacher and helpful when asked.  Gives a lot feedback on papers and will go into more depth if asked.  I would take one of her classes again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: TEACHINGWTG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very helpful and interesting.

If you can avoid this, do so. This class felt like the LONGEST hour and a half!!! She also picked on people in class (not me) but I thought it was unprofessional and rude.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: ENG200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>lots of work - LOTS of it - its not hard but there is a lot of it - just a few papers - if your a good writer you wont have a problem - there is a lot of work, but its really not too hard but its time consuming</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2004<br>Class Name: ENG300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There are weekly assignments, but if you put in the time, it's a breeze.

She's cold, makes it a habit to verbally attack students in class, and never passes up an opportunity to shove her own pretentious writings down students' throats. Horrible teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2003<br>Class Name: ENG480<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrific teacher! Makes you work hard and collaborate, but workload isn't unfair. Extremely enlightened and intelligent professor.
