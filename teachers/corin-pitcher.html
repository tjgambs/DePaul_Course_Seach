I learned a lot but I feel like I wasn't properly tested on any of it. Exam questions are difficult and most require extra levels of understanding in concepts from classreadingHW. Everything is multiple choice so there's no way of showing your thought process. Recommended if you don't mind your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2015<br>Class Name: CSC447<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm and final are 75% of your grade. The hw and lecture don't prepare you for them. The readings, which are a lot and mostly pointless, don't prepare you for them. You better have really good prior knowledge of C and C++, and some Ruby would help. Try to take this with someone else. Otherwise, prepare for disappointment.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2015<br>Class Name: CSC447<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't mind he can not explain things clearly but I really hate that his notes and reading assignment which are very confusing and irrelevant, making you don't know how to study at all.  Especially for the final exam, there is no way to prepare for it because you don't how to get started.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2015<br>Class Name: CSC447<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exams are difficult and totally irrelevant to homeworks. Lectures are painfully boring, especially after the midterm. Hard to follw, unless for experienced programmers.

The assignments are okay, but the exams are a different story. Most of the stuff he tests on is stuff you never had in assignments and stuff he races over in lecture. Also, the main book is outdated and boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2015<br>Class Name: CSC447<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His boring and the materials are not well ordered and very confusing.

Make no sense, no idea how to study. I tried to read the book but it doesn't help preparing for the homework and exam. His lecture is boring and the stuffs he teach are messy.  Doing the homework won't help you preparing for the exam which is very hard. Try to skip him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2015<br>Class Name: CSC347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The homework is all done with testing suites, so you can see before submission whether or not you'll get full credit. He sets up an email blaster for his courses so if you have questions you can either email him or email the entire class. The lectures are generally pretty amusing as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2015<br>Class Name: CSC447<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't understand the high rankings.

Multiple choice exams are extremely hard and are not in sync with the homework or lectures. Class is supposedly about learning how to learn new languages, but ended up being a scattershot tutorial in Scala. Prone to tangents in lecture. Homeworks can be confusing. Tons of reading, most of it irrelevant. Take this with someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2014<br>Class Name: CSC447<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pros:  Learned a great deal.  HW strikes the balance between not too easy and not too hard.  He's a fine teacher.  A student friendly grade scale.  He's pretty good about helping via e-mail.  Cons:  A couple lectures were painful and boring.  Extremely difficult exams that more than offset the grade scale.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2014<br>Class Name: CSC347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Pitcher is one of the most intelligent professors at DePaul. His knowledge, and more importantly his ability to pass that knowledge onto students is unmatched in the CDM. I really enjoyed his class. Is it easy... In a word NO.  Is it worth the effort... YES. I've come out of the class with a more refined knowledge of Computer Science.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: CSC347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Pitcher is one of my favorite professors at CDM. Unless you really hate learning, you'll enjoy his lectures. Also, he's very intelligent person with a great personality. Take his courses because you can't go wrong with Prof Pitcher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2013<br>Class Name: CSC447<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely nice guy, very helpful and enthusiastic about the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2013<br>Class Name: CSC347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Pitcher is one of the best professors at CDM. You will enjoy his class & learn a lot from his lectures. He's probably harder than you average professor if you are the type of student who just wants to pass the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2012<br>Class Name: SE560<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst professors at DePaul. Not only is this class extremely boring but the material is very outdated. Who works with XML anymore? His assignments are very very long and extremely difficult. You'll spend anywhere between 12-30 hours working on the assignments and with his draconian grading policies still not get anywhere. Skip this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: CSC347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easily one of the greatest classes I've taken at DePaul (which is quite a few), and mostly because of the engaging and entertaining professor who absolutely knows his stuff. I came in with high expectations and had them met.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2012<br>Class Name: CSC447<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome! Not nearly as scary as his reputation. Be ready to hit the ground running - nearly impossible to catch up if you get behind. Would love to take a compilers class or an OS class from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2012<br>Class Name: CSC347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very very willing to help any and all students in his class, and is very good at making you feel less dumb about the "stupid" questions you've got.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2012<br>Class Name: CSC447<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is from Britain so British accent. He explains things very well. Though at times, he goes on about things that shouldn't matter. Exams are multiple choice. Final was lot harder since it covered mostly the second half of the course (theory). Homeworks are ok not too difficult. Just have to put some time into it. Take this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2008<br>Class Name: SE473<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Slow grader. Explains things well, answers all questions and encourages participation. Assignments were somewhat tedious but educational anyway. Sometimes goes on long tangents so we didn't cover all the material we should. Overall, pretty good and recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2008<br>Class Name: SE560<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i'm surprised by some of the comments. i thought he was a great teacher... explained things well, assignments were challenging, but graded fair. he  was especially helpful in answering questions both in class and by email/forum. one of the better teachers i've had at depaul for sure and would definitely take from him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2008<br>Class Name: SE560<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guys knows his stuff.  He spends alot of time at the computer in the class.  Class moves slow.  I was very interested in the topic, but extremely bored.  Assignments are as tedious as the class.  I spent more time trying to get stuff working than learning the topic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2008<br>Class Name: SE560<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2008<br>Class Name: SE560<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't have any problems getting anything to run. I was impressed with amount of work he has done to make sure all the code runs. It does take a while for the grades to come through however. He doesn't seem like a bad professor to me. I've definitely had much worse.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2006<br>Class Name: SE560<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy sucks.  Assignment takes forever to get graded.  Made me lose interest on a subject that was important.  Assignments had no focus and barely anything to do with the subject, most work was figuring out how to set things up rather than the assigment.  Unfair grading, not helpful with problems or questions.  Not recommended to anyone.</div></div></div></body></html>
