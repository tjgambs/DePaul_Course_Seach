Do the assignments and show up for class. Pop quizzes but usually tells when. Class is pretty easy if you do the work. Study for the exams, they count for most of your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: AFROAMERRELIG<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a Reverend and this is evident is his delivery style.  His passion of the subject keeps the class's attention for the most part.  This was his first year as a DePaul professor so he was somewhat unorganized.  My advice would be to take this class, it will get better in subsequent years.  Go to class, and it won't be too hard to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2006<br>Class Name: MORALISSUES<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The sweetest guy! As the others have said, the class is fairly redundant and common sense.  Reading is lightly enforced but he will do ANYTHING to make sure you understand the material.  Mid-term and final are fairly easy to pass, no matter how bad you thought you did.  Extra credit available.  Take him, he's a cutie-pie!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2006<br>Class Name: REL240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! Though the subject matter was redundant at times, the rev is very entertaining. I am secular and didn't feel at all out of place in this primarily black christianity course.  I feel I really got my moneys worth and walked away with a good grade and some more prespective.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class and hes a good guy.. it's just the class gets boring after a while... and the reading can become boring. But if you listen in class and skim the reading it's an easy A. The only thing I didn't like about the class was- the test questions were sometimes worded funny so they are hard to understand...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2005<br>Class Name: REL222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best teacher i have ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: REL215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the funniest teachers I've had, and he doesn't even try!  His laugh will make you laugh.  He's very enthusiastic and class is very enjoyable.  On top of that course work isn't very hard, as long as you keep up on reading assignments.</div></div></div></body></html>
