Very intuitive style for lecturing. Pretty lazy sometimes and does not come completely prepared for lectures, but he is so smart he can usually get away with it. Work hard and you can get an A easily. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: ECO507<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Econometrics is an inherently complicated subject. You can learn a lot in Professor Stoler's class, including topics beyond the text. He is willing to help, if you ask and make the effort. He's very intelligent and has a unique perspective. "Just be prepared for the unexpected," is the best summation of his class I could have hoped to say myself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2014<br>Class Name: ECO507<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Avi is an ass plain and simple; however, you learn a lot in your class, he is willing to help, and is a pretty smart guy at least in econometrics. He is a definite take if you are a hard worker and want to actually learn something. Just be prepared for the unexpected. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2014<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor EVER. Doesn't teach/explain anything. Makes you feel stupid for asking questions and very hard to understand.
