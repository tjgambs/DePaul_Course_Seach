    Elliott is one of the most unsatisfactory professors I've ever experienced at DePaul. Myself and the rest of the class learned ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in his 333 class . He basically rambles about his career, teaches basic accounting taught in FIN-310 or ACC-101, and then hands out C's and D's like candy because "we're all idiots". Don't take this fool.

    Prof. Elliott is a guy that's devoted to his craft; he challenges anyone asking questions, but as more of a learning opportunity for other students.  Need to know big concepts (risk, return, CAPM) and be able to use them in tandem to solve problems.  2 Tests and a comprehensive group project.

    Elliott's class consists of pure lecture, no study guides, no slides, pop quizzes, 2 midterms within the first 6 weeks, and a final project on valuing a company. His class is easy if you attend all his classes and take awesome notes. If you miss one class, you will feel kind of lost and his exams are solely based on his lectures, not the text.

    Look, I will rate this professor on how I rate every teacher, if it is an easy A or not. The amount of work for Elliot is crazy. Yes, he is a nice guy but whatever. It is way too much work every week, and I got a B. I would recommend a different teacher.

    Elliott is extremely good at explaining difficult concepts. FIN617 is essentially a glorified GSB420, lots of stats and math. Elliott is thought-provoking and really gets you to think in depth about concepts most people take at face value. He won't accept feedback that isn't original thought. Take if you truly wish to learn from the best.

    One of the best professors I've had at DePaul! Class is not only easy, but interesting. Elliott really knows how to keep the class engaged and is overall a great and funny guy. Taking him again for FIN 380. Ps. Don't buy the book, just come to class - he'll even tell you that himself on the first day of class.

    Learned the most from this class. Your critical thinking will be maximized and I came out with a much stronger understand of finance. He challenges you to think, so participation with some thoughtful comments/questions is a must. Also, had to read 2 novels, but good reads.

    ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. No other way to describe Elliot. He is a real teacher; no textbook guides his class. He really gets you to think and when case reports are assigned, they're based off in class discussions. Be attentive, contribute, and be on time...you'll be fine. Best experience as a finance major at DePaul. Wish I took him for other classes.

    Probably DePaul's only professor that doesn't teach straight from the book. He takes you away from GAAP and teaches you useful information in financial valuation. For those thinking Elliott or Codina, let's just say NONE of my friends who took Codina's class did well. Homework is really helpful towards studying for exams. Easy A/A-.

    Prof Elliott is a very cool guy. Wharton grad, yet not a nerd. Very able to relate to students in the Finance world in a way that makes you able to understand, as well as learn quite a bit. Tests very straight forward from lectures.  Attendance not mandatory except tests and very rarely pop quizzes are derived from lectures.  Book only used for Hw.

    I love professor elliot! I'm taking him again for FIN 380 in the summer. He really teaches you and doesn't just expect you to know the material like other pfoessors at DePaul. You can tell he is really passionate about teaching and wants his students to ask questions. If you ask him something, he will give you a 30 minute answer. You wont regret it

    Awesome professor! I don't see how Prof. Elliot can get bad ratings. Maybe from some lazy students who have barely passed their other FIN classes with C's. You will learn a ton in his class. I feel he was the best FIN prof I've had during my years at DePaul. Attendance is mandatory, but as previously stated,you'll actually want to attend.Highly rec

    Just register his class at the earliest. His 2 projects are kinda of hard.  especially the 2nd one.  But don't worry get a very good partner and then work with him/her ahead of time.  He reply to your emails in hours. great guy. you must speak in the class.

    Superb teacher in all respects...learned the most in his class than virtually any other FIN class...he has JPMorgan i-banking experience, so he teaches real-world stuff...class consists of attendance (40-60% of grade) and 3 projects. Yes, you have to attend...but you will WANT to attend.

    This guy apparently gets good ratings for the finance intro courses such as 310 and 311.... but beware, if you get him for 333 or 312 (the very last finance courses you take senior year) it turns into a joke. my grade for 312 was based on 40% excel models and 60% attendance &amp; class participation...and you will learn NOTHING. a waste of time money.

    I learned nothing in this class.  The book was useless. He doesn't respond to e-mails and cancels class frequently.  He doesn't explain why you got a problem wrong on a test or assignment very clearly.  The material isn't even difficult, but this guy always tries to trick you.   Your grade is always a surprise.  Such BS...this class was a joke.

    WOW! He made me want to be a finance major! This guy presented the material so clearly and repeated everything! Never even read the book and got an A+ in the class. Just pay attention (easy to do since he makes class interesting), make sure you get the concepts and you will do well. There is no excuse for doing poorly in this class! Take him!!!

    Elliot is the best professor in the whole world! I didnt think the material was easy at all, but he truly uses all his teaching skills to make it as painless as possible! Extremely helpful and cares about students. If you go to class, take notes and prepare for quizes you'll get an A for sure. One of the best at DePaul!!

    Class was interesting but not easy.  I'm not usually a participator, but in this class you have to if you want a good grade. Make it a point to sit in the front row and say something every class so he gets to know you and you should do fine.

    Amazing teacher. He knows so much about the subject, and has actually been apart of some of the case studies he teaches you. Great guy. All you have to do is show up to class and speak just a little and that is 50% of your grade the other half is all group work.

    You do learn a lot. However, you don't get to pick your groups. The case studies for the midterm and final are a bit of a challenge and are time consuming. Participation is 50% but please don't just talk for the sake of talking.

    Very good teacher.60% of the grade is in-class discussion but they are fun and useful. rof is super nice guy and has experience in the finance world so he knows what he's talking about. No midterm,but each class you have to read case studies. Recommended!
