You need to read for this class since there is a pop quiz at the beginning of every class. Most of the time Spark notes won't help you with the questions he's asking. you'll need to write a "perfect" paper in order to receive an A on them. He let's you rewrite them, but most of the time you probably won't get that A. Not worth it. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brian Niro is a really cool professor.  He explains the stories we read in detail and is funny in lectures, but he is a tough grader. For him (& I quote)- "C is average, B is above average, and A is a perfect paper". He also makes you write papers in a special format only he likes. Other than the grading he's good!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2015<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Niro is awesome. He lets the students discuss the topics while he guides the conversation. Very reasonable, available to meet with. A few short responses and two 5 pg papers. Do the readings and participate. Fun class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2014<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My second time taking his class and I loved it! He's a phenomenal speaker and does a great job keeping people engaged. The class was based on four books, two papers, and a very easy exam if you read. Would take again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2013<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly the best class and teacher I have taken at DePaul. I took him over winter break and he made what would have been an ungodly amount of work fun and interesting. He is hilarious and passionate about his work. He made me excited to get up for my 8am, no other teacher has yet to do that.  10/10 would take another class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher at DePaul by a mile.

I'm a little surprised I got a B, even though I read all the text, completed every assignment, and participated in class; but it was still a good class. I would take him again. Cool guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do yourself a favor and take this guy. This is one of the best classes at DePaul. Easy A if you do the work on time and spend a good amount of time into work. 4 one page papers and 1 six page paper for the whole course. Honestly the best teacher at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very knowledgeable teacher.

He is extremely intelligent and is knowledgeable about a variety of subjects. He does everything he can to help out his students, assigns interesting reading and minimal assgnmts. He is engaging in class and outside.  I will definitely be taking another class of his. Everyone should take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2011<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a freshman,his class was wondeful. I had him for an 8am class and he did his best to try and keep us awake. Hes awesome. Everyone wanted him for the next writing class, hes great. His essays are easy. and just go to peer revision wkshops and youll be good. hes excellent!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2010<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely interesting class, one of my favorites yet! Niro is great, he keeps things very entertaining. The material is great and the class gets you to think outside of the box. Grading is very fair. Definitely take this class and professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2010<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Niro is a great professor. He's a fair grader and the material is pretty straight forward. If you are not going to read the assigned reading then don't take him. He gives you tailored quizzes against things like sparknotes so if you don't read then your screwed for the quizzes you have before every class starts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was one of the most entertaining and educational courses i've ever taken. Brian Niro is fantastic, and actually keeps everyone hella intersted in the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2009<br>Class Name: ENG211<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is honestly a very nice guy, but his lack of knowledge on the subject is humiliating. Essentially a 200 level style analysis course became a freshman grammar class until the last week... probably because this was the extent of his ability. Easy A, but fellow english majors: stay FAR away.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2007<br>Class Name: ENG247<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with some of the other reviewers, in that he is bald.  However, I think that his baldness is somewhat deceiving.  He clearly shaves his head!!  Prof Niro must be from Scotland or Bolivia, because his accent was at times hard to follow.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2007<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I hadn't given Prof. Niro much thought and one day, it was like he was super handsome. I think its his laugh and the fact that he's so smart and laid back. But to more important things. Easy grader, read the material, participate! You will do fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2007<br>Class Name: ENG286<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So far, one of the best professors I have had at DePaul. Not only does he keep the class interesting, but is also there to help you with the paper. There are 4-5 novels to read, but he picks interesting books so the reading is very simple. I think he doesn't teach here anymore, but if he is available I would recommend him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor...keeps class interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2006<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher.  Makes class interesting.  Fair workload, just read the books, they are good and interesting.  Paper is straight foward.  too bad he's not teaching anymore at DePaul, you missed your chance for an awesome teacher!  maybe he'll be back.  If he does teach again, TAKE HIM, you'll be glad you did.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2006<br>Class Name: BRIDG101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a really good teacher. I actually learned alot. By the way that spoke when he first introduced himself it seemed like he was going to be very hard. Just make sure that you dont say stupid things, because he does'ent like that, and he will make thatb very known. Overall, he's a great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you ask him for help on papers, he gives really good tips.  His grading is sometimes difficult, but a huge factor in his grading is improvement on papers in the quarter.  Meaning if you make an effort and meet with him and your papers improve significantly, A in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2006<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's great well rounded teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: LITANDIDENTIT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yep, kinda hard grader. I didn't understand his lectures very much (one of those over-analytical types). I had no clue what i was writing on my papers but got high Bs on them.. totally talked out my sass. He's pretty funny though. *I'd recommend.* Gave quizes which i aced (i used sparknotes, didn't read)... DONT BE LATE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2006<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He filled in for our teacher who got sick, and although he was nice and put in a tough spot, he was a tough grader. We really got screwed having our teacher leave in the middle of the quarter. I'd take a full class with him, but his grading seemed a little extreme, considering the circumstance. He's OK... little rough, but hot!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he was an good professor that spelled out exactly what he expected.  He graded papers a little unfairly.  Let us out early all the time, and was very funny!  Overall I thought he was a very good professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best English teachers I've ever had. Clever, intelligent, and easy to understand. Likes to joke around. Occasional quizzes. About four to five papers. Straight forward. Night class wasn't bad. He hated staying as much as us.. so he was super lenient and awesome about time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: ENG101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, all his classes are always fun, you'll want to come back again and again.  Average grader, but is willing to help anyone any time just ask and he'll make an arrangement.  It's a great clalss to take. Couple essays, two books to read, and some vocab.  easy to pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2005<br>Class Name: ENG327636<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a pretty difficult grader but if you go and talk to him he will spell everything out for you.
