She has a passion for what she teaches and that makes her lectures really interesting. You learn a lot but are expected to participate, which isnt hard because she never shuts anyones opinions or ideas down. She is super easy to talk to and i would definitely recommend taking her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2015<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As an anthro major, I definitely look up to professor Kersel. She's super helpful and makes sure you understand the subjects. There are some pop quizzes, but as long as you read the material and take notes you should be perfectly fine. You learn some super interesting stuff! Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2015<br>Class Name: ANT104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i seriously hated this class - she's so unclear about grading criteria it's not even funny. She'll require you to source from material which she hands out, but it's stuff we've never gone over, so you're literally grasping in the darkness. It's so stupid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2015<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has to be the rudest professor I've ever met. Rudest teacher, for that matter. She has a habit of interrupting presentations with questions, directly interrupting the train of thought of the presenter. She also has a habit of calling people out in class, in front of everyone, and making quite rude remarks to people. Don't take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2014<br>Class Name: ANT206<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Morag is straight to the point during lecture, which I personally appreciate. She leaves room for open discussions, there's no solid right answer ab evolution. Grateful 2 be enrolled there this quarter. Honestly, some of these Anthropology and Archaeology courses should be more recommended to enroll in at Driehaus just saying</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2013<br>Class Name: ANT204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professionalism and Ethics needs to be just an Ethics class, but that being said Dr. Kersel did an amazing job for it being her first time teaching it. Being taught how to make a poster and fill out an IRB was an amazing skill to learn!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: ANT390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice person, interesting class, and she knows her stuff. All readings were relevant, and the assignments were never a problem. Basically, just show up for class, do your work, and don't be obnoxious.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2012<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really interesting teacher. I participated all the time and didn't learn fun...good blow off class to watch movies about archaeology and Indiana Jones...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendance is mandatory! All pop quizzes. (No midterm/final) Extremely tough grader... Hardest class. Believe me, you have been warned. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2012<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you like to read A LOT about archaeology then this is the right class for you.. she knows what she's talking about and is really passionate about the subject. lots of labs and quizzes will be given. attendance is MANDATORY which sucked for an 8am class. also, although we're in ANT 103, she treats us like we're 6 years old..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2011<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Agree with the post below, she NEVER gave out 100% even on the easiest assignments where she made no indication of anything we did wrong.  That being said, she was very nice and obviously very passionate about her subject, and there's something to be said for that. Definitely cared about her students, but she should make her grading policy clearer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2011<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Discover Chicago Museums was fun, but she isnt a great professor. Smart, but her grading skills are lacking. Her syllabus isnt specific on grading criteria and she NEVER gives out 100%'s. I was consistently .5 point from a perfect score. And the article readings were &quot;required&quot; but were a complete waste of time. Alas, discover is required at DPU...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2011<br>Class Name: ANT120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Kersel is awesome! She's super funny and has a lot of experience in the field. Tests rely heavily on notes (which she posted online) and the textbook which she goes over. I took a lab with her, and it was great (painless!). She's very helpful and loves what she does. She wasn't super strict on attendance either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2010<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kersel is great! I had virtually no background in archaeology and I learned so much from her class. She is a little scatterbrained but really knows her stuff. The tests are heavily based on the text book, so keep up with the reading. The study guides on the text book website is extremely helpful. Great class, great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2010<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very passionate about what she teaches. She is very nice and has a lot of cool experiences to share. Material was somewhat dry but she made  the best of it. No hw but def study for tests and quizzes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2010<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! Loved her! Class was not always the most interesting but she makes the best of it. She has a lot of experience and is always upbeat and happy!

She knows her stuff (has a lot of experience in the archeology field). Overall a nice, understand person and understand that the topic can be hard to grasp at once.. she'll help you and gives good feedback. Tests and quizzes are way easier than she makes you think they are.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's awesome! A great teacher with an amazing life! She knows her stuff and has some great examples from her own life. (Her Husband was cool too! They are both archaeologists!)</div></div></div></body></html>
