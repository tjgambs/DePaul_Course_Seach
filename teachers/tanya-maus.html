Seemed nervous in class, reading from a pre-typed lecture and stumbling over concepts, but may have just been her personality, because she never stopped sounding nervous. Very intelligent, knows her stuff, etc. I'd take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: HST287<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What an amazing professor! I actually liked going to class.  Read the packet and the textbook and make the discussions fun.  Asian history really is an amazing subject. I would for sure take her again!</div></div></div></body></html>
