Weekly 1 to 2 question quizzes where calculator is allowed. Lectures are long from how explicit and thorough they are. No surprises in the class and very easy to get an A if you are able to figure out how to use your TI83 or TI84 statistical functions as he does not really quire work to be shown.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2015<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>1 quiz a week. Need a subscription to MyMathLab (& it's worthless) Lectures are boring, but that is math for you. Review packets for midterm and final. Overall good professor, I just really think the MathLab needs to go. It is about 100 dollars and the only plus side of it is that the professor doesn't have to grade homework. No book needed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy, his lectures are long because he goes through what it is that he is teaching you in great detail. That only helped me. He will work with you. Also, he is kind of goofy, but I found him to be cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2015<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good guy! I'm not at all the best in math. Mat 135 was very difficult for me so i was skeptical about this class but he made it really easy for me to understand. Don't understand his lectures? it's fine. Just do the homework and you're more than likely to get 100% on his quizzes that happen every week. I would take this professor again. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2014<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, the class was fairly easy. Even though I don't recommend it, I did skip....a lot but still managed to pass with an A. He's very laid back and gives you chances to make up quizzes, even if he clearly stated in the syllabi that he wouldn't let people make them up. Midterm and Final are cake. Great guy but dry, which makes the classes seem longer</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: MTH130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great guy. He is there to help but his format of the class is a little strange. You can't use a calculator through the entire year yet he allows it on the final. The math lab doesn't apply much to what you do in class making that the most tedious part of the entire class. He allowed us to bypass the due dates but don't depend on that. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great guy but his teaching isn't the best. Homework can get complicating but you have unlimited tries. Quiz every Wednesday at the end of the class... drops the lowest 3 out of 8. Long and boring lectures. No calculator use but fairly easy midterm and final.</div></div></div></body></html>
