Overall, the class was very repetitive. We talked about technology & how it affected society the whole quarter. There were also 2 multimodal projects & a final 8 page paperdigication. Carbajal was pretty nice and the class was easy. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just take his class, its great! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chill teacher. Gives 100s out for the (many) minor assignments as long as you do them. He's a bit of a tough grader for the big papers, but it's totally fair. Could be a little clearer on assignments, but just ask questions and you'll be fine. Has cut class short every single time, won't hold you longer than necessary </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor and truly a genuinely nice man also. Often cut lectures short, he won't waste your time with busy work. Gives excellent feedback and allows you to earn 100% points when you revise your work. Tells you exactly what he expects and offers a lot of assistance in the writings you do. Recommend him X 100000 p.s. don't need any books!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really nice and helpful teacher. you hardly use the textbook and he understands his students. he is willing to extend your work whenever you need it there is only two quizzes and the rest are typing papers he's a really nice and funny professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104SEC332<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: P</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher and very understanding. I don't know why he has bad ratings. He is someone who is willing to go the extra mile for his students. I would love to have him as my professor again. He is someone who wants his students to view him as a person and not as a monstrous professor. Amazing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was so cool! I really don't know why he has bad ratings. Take him, he's great and understanding and just funny! (: Don't really need the textbook much. No tests. Not an easy grader. But he is still cool!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked professor Carbajal as an instructor!  We only had three major assignments and he always let us come to him for revisions if we got a low grade on an assignment.  I'm not really sure why he got a low score, but I've had him twice now and he's been great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is TERRIBLE!!! I've never seen someone grade a papers so harshly! God could submit a paper to this man and he would take off points. Please don't take his class. Simply because you'll never get a good grade on any paper you ever do. You can't please Pro.

All of my friends in WRD 103 learned very different things. He didn't even mention the word "rhetoric". Super easy assignments though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Carbajal is good teacher. The class material is very easy and there was almost never any homework. The only thing that was annoying was that he constantly changed due dates and the syllabus and it got confusing. But mostly he postponed due dates!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher do not take his class. Cannot teach and is bias in the activities he makes us do. All of the things we have done so far have been completely pointless and has not prepared us at all to write our final research paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2012<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His instruction was extremely unclear.

Nice enough, and allows for students to do well, just a bit irritating.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2012<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice professor. The only issue I had was that he relied too heavily on the textbook for a writing course. I Wish he had been a little more "free" with teaching the material; most of time we had to read and figure it out. Keep up with the assignments. He tells you exactly what to edit & if you do what he says, you're guaranteed an A.</div></div></div></body></html>
