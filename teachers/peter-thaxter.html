He is very clear with what is expected. There are 2 midterms and they are not very hard at all. The final project is worth most of your grade. It's a lot of work, so if you start early you will be fine. Peter is awesome and tells jokes and tries to keep you entertained. He is also very helpful and just wants you to do well.</div></div></div></body></html>
