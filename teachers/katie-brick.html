She uses her time well in class and makes her students think about things society often ignores.  Articles are posted weekly and theres a small, straightforward, easy quiz to take on it in class worth a couple points.   Papers are often but very easy and she grades mainly based on effort.  TAKE IT TAKE IT</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a very interesting teacher and you could tell she had a passion for her work.
