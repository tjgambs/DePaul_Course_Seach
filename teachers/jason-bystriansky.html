Lecture is always so interesting and he makes the material easy, even though there is a lot to know. It also helps that he has the greatest Canadian accent of all time and incorporates funny pictures of Dr. Dean throughout his powerpoints.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2013<br>Class Name: BIO193<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jason is such a nice guy and very intelligent. His lectures are clear and thorough. HIs exams questions are a little on the tougher side because he actually makes you think about the information instead of just regurgitating what's on the powerpoints. I would definitely recommend him for BIO 193.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2012<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jason is so nice! He is very intelligent, but also teaches in an easy-to-follow manner. He doesn't set out to trick you, make you feel dumb, or make the class impossible. It's not a blowoff class, but it is very manageable thanks to his methods. Very approachable guy, very down to earth, very fair... I hope he stays at DePaul for future students!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2012<br>Class Name: BIO193<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, awesome guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2012<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great lectures and crystal clear. Very helpful. As long as you are attentive during his great lectures then you shouldn't have to read. Would recommend to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His tests are straightforward but covers a lot of material, so don't slack off. He is very receptive to questions, not scary to approach at all! Very smart and funny. yea, just take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2011<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wicked smart prof and really knows his physiology.  I went to him for help several times this term and he really took the time to explain things to me.  I was nervous about asking for help at first but he's a really nice person and cares about his students.  Take his course, he's a fair prof and you'll learn a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2011<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really enjoyed him! so much so that I'm planning on taking another of his classes this fall. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2011<br>Class Name: BIO103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of DePaul's best Bio professors. Obviously a really smart guy, but he didn't just rattle on about physiology - I actually enjoyed his lectures. He somehow managed to keep an entire lecture hall entertained while talking about (or, as he would say in his Canadian accent, &quot;aboot&quot;) sea cucumbers. I would definitely take another of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2011<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting and enthusiastic about physiology.  He stressed the importance of the textbook readings but followed up with fun examples and stories.  He helped me like physiology, which I didn't think was possible prior to his class.  Overall, a great prof and I wouldn't hesitate to take another class he was teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2011<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bystriansky is energetic, smart, personable, funny, engaging, & worldly. He cares for students & encourages feedback. Summarizes the text but incorporates a decent amount of outside material. Gives relevant examples, clarifies topics, & emphasizes what needs to be studied in class. Reading text & powerpoints help but don't substitute class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2011<br>Class Name: BIO115<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are taking biology at DePaul avoid this professor. It's not because he's a hard grader or anything, but he doesn't teach anything you couldn't have read out of the book. Attendance isn't mandatory and if I could go back I wouldn't go at all. He literally read directly from the power point every day; it was very frustrating.</div></div></div></body></html>
