He is clear when talking about what is expected from the students. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely boring class. He likes to talk to hear himself talk and really doesn't teach anything useful. Not clear with what he wants most of the time. Very nit-picky in the grading process! I went in a few times to clarify what he wanted and then on my final grade he went back on more than a few things that he had told me to fix.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2012<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He comes off as quite arrogant, and although he can be helpful, he's very intimidating. In class, he is often vague and unclear, which makes completing assignments difficult. I would not recommend him to anyone, even someone who loves English and writing like I do.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT take a class from this professor. He was very unclear on what he wanted to see in written assignments and then became overly picky in the grading process. I and many other students had to rewrite assignments multiple times. He would tell me to visit his office to discuss my paper and then have nothing to say about what I did wrong.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decent class, not awful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2009<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Each professor has a different style and is entitled to his own teaching method especially after years of work, schooling, and mediocre pay but Jason Windsdale has no place at DePaul. He was quite honestly the worst teacher I have ever had. His class is a freak show and he talks about his Wiccian religion a lot which made me uncomfortable.BEWARE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>amazing. loved this guy. i'd take him again! show up for class, do the work. its hard but it actually feels like a college class and he only wants to see you succeed. his handwriting is a little sloppy and he loves buffy the vampire slayer but i loved his lectures and his focal point classes are REALLY INTERESTING! TAKE HIM!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
