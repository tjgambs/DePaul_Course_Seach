Really wants you to pass and feels that you should get an A. I got an A by just doing the homework. Do the homework for the week and you will ace the quiz easily. The midterm and final are not difficult and he gives study guides. Homework is the key to your success though. There to anwer any question. Take him for stats!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice teacher, as an international student, he always answer my question.I am come from China.

He wants his students to understand and do well, and is very willing to help outside of class and answer questions. You must do the homework, study for the quizzes, midterm and final, but what do you expect? You're in college.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2013<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is not easy at all. hw is not graded but you will have a quiz on it every week. 8 total @ 5% of your grade each, but he only takes your top 5. I think the problem is that he goes through so much material so fast its hard for students to keep up. if you like stats/have taken a stats class before you'll be just fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take his class!! Great professor. He has his own website where he has slides for all of the lectures as well as the homework problems. He is super nice and explains everything very well. I switched to his class from another professor and I am so glad I did! He really tries to be as helpful as possible and wants you to do well. Take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy take his class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2012<br>Class Name: MTH137<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class wasn't so bad. Problems and power-points are on his website. I rented the book and not even once look at it. He made mistakes here and there, but recovered it in a fair amount of time. Always will to communicate. He gets to class an hour before, so you can reach him early for questions. Oh second quiz is he hardest, so put more attention!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2012<br>Class Name: MATH137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take him, not worth it. Gives you extremely difficult quizzes. And doesn't even know how to teach. Do yourself a favor and take another teacher.</div></div></div></body></html>
