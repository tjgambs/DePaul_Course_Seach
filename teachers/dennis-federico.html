He challenges students to think for themselves.  He doesn't give students answers.  He will be a challenge for students who were use to rote memorization style teaching.  I think he is one of the best professors I have ever had.  I have learn more from his class than I have in 5 years.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2011<br>Class Name: TL415<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would never take Professor Federico again. I did not walk away from the class with anything I would implement in my classroom. He thinks very highly of himself, and is not afraid to continually bring that up. If you try to offer up a a different approach to teaching science, he will argue that his way is the only way.</div></div></div></body></html>
