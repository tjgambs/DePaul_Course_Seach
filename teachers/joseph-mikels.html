He is in my opinion one of the best at DePaul. The work is manageable and if you engage in discussion, you won't be lost in the exams. He is very easy going and willing to help. He is just great!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2011<br>Class Name: PSY370<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Mikels is fantastic. His exams are all essays though they are in depth, he covers all the material very thoroughly. Also using articles as opposed to a text book, I think the material was much easier to absorb.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2011<br>Class Name: PSY303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Mikels is awesome! He is a great professor and very passionate about his research. Even though our class was really big, he always incorporated discussions and activities to keep everyone interested.

If you want to learn about philosophy in an informative yet fun way with an amazing teacher, take him. He frequently shows video clips to explain what he's talking about and treats his students like individuals.  Don't get me wrong! you have to show up, take notes, and study.  As long as u dont try to slack, youll have a great experience</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: RM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor.
