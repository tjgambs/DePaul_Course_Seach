    The course is called Self Exploration: Inside Ourselves, Outside with Others. It is a blended format, with some students in the classroom and others, like myself, by a live Internet video feed. Kenn designed the course and did a great job of juggling the class sessions and creating an interesting personal experience for all the students.

    Kenn was very helpful and patient in answering questions and assisting students. He was fair in his grading and assessments. He treated everyone as equals and returned messages quickly. His course was very clear and interesting and I would recommend it to others.

    Kenn was very engaged and responsive to students. The course was interesting and I learned alot about the subject and myself. The course was the most organized compared to others I've taken in the program.  The student interactions were very helpful.

    Kenn, is a very absent instructor, rarely get back to you with answers to your questions.  Grades for work done are very subjective and work is abundant and very personal in nature.  The class is very touchy, feelly, if you do not like to talk about yourself you will have difficulty with the class.

    Ken was a great first instructor for students in the SNL program at DePaul.  He was helpful, and provided constructive feedback to students.
