He wastes the first 30 minutes of class with "fun facts", then tries to cram in a lecture in an hour with us rarely getting the chance to even try it ourselves. His midterm was extremely easy, and I'm expecting the final to be just as easy. Also has an annoying lab.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2013<br>Class Name: MAT262<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Where do I start with Professor Petersen?... First, it was clear that he didn't know the material that he was supposed to be teaching.  He showed little to no interest and was rude and insulting to students who asked questions in class.  His standard response was to "Google it."  The more effort you put in, the more angry he would become.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice and very helpful.  Online homework is sometimes problematic though..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2013<br>Class Name: MAT162<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Petersen is the best math professor I've ever had. His lectures are so clear and make calc so easy. His quizzes can be tough but there is extra credit.  The midterm is not bad, but the final is a bit hard. If you want to learn though, totally take him! You'll know calc inside and out. His labs are so much fun too. And he's really good looking!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2012<br>Class Name: MAT215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Petersen is awesome! He makes math fun! He's always available for help and his passion for math makes going to class worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2012<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an awesome teacher. He's super funny so class isn't as boring and he makes everything clear. If you don't understand something, he makes sure to explain better. I definitely enjoyed his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: MATH140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  material is straight forward.  weekly quizzes were from the homework and you could have your homework out and copy it over.  extra credit on several quizzes.  weekly reading quizzes online were not graded too hard.  I recommend him as an instructor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2011<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, the class is hard but he's a fair greader and a lot of oportunity for a good grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: MAT110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher, but class can be repetitive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2011<br>Class Name: MAT162<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  He doesn't do the work for you but he helps a lot.  Absolutely take his class if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2011<br>Class Name: MAT161<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Petersen is a fantastic teacher!  It is easy to see that he loves math and he loves teaching.  Every class we get a fun fact of the day and during lab time we do group work and discuss interesting topics.  I can't even think of enough nice things to say about him.  Outstanding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2010<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to fail this class then take him. First day of class he said that he will not be accepting questions during class to go see during his office hrs or a math tutor. Fast pace, you mightiest will take a video camera to class to record the lecture. Nice guy but that won't help you pass the class. FYI Kyle and Thomas Petersen is the same guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2009<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice professor tries to explain things in detail but his pace is kind of fast. Doesn't really stop to see if anyone has questions and HW is given every week & Quiz's are on 3 HW Q's. So if you need help on HW question or something that happened in class 1.) Go to his office during his office hrs or make an appointment w/ him or 2.) See a Math Tutor</div></div></div></body></html>
