If you have an opinion keep it to yourself. I have never wanted to say this about anyone, but she should not be working at DePaul. Tenure sure does get to people's heads.

She is a true expert in the field of cultural Anthropology. She assigns an essay every week but the readings are fascinating so the writing is worth it. I strongly encourage you to take her, you won't regret it! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: ANT386<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst professors at DePaul.  I feel bad for Cultural ANT majors who want to learn more from her because she has little to offer (or so she portrays it as).  Deal with it if you're a major, AVOID if not a major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2013<br>Class Name: ANT201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marked me down for being wrong about things that I had multiple sources for. Gave me a consistent B+ based off of her own personal opinion, not the actual quality of my argument or the reliability of my sources. Awful lecturer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't know how to use a computer and blames it on her &quot;gender&quot;. Rude. Condescending. Unorganized. Teaches ethnocentrism but is close-minded as an anthropology teacher. Will lower your grade a whole letter if you miss one class without an official note. Terrible lecturer, which is what the class is based on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: ANT315<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had this professor last year... absolutely horrible. worst class I have taken at depaul so far. She doesn't know what she wants from her students - even when you ask her. Not helpful at all, and expects such a deep level of interest from everyone. I wouldn't take unless you're already an anthropologist.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2011<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i love this woman. funny, engaging, personable. definitely recommend her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2009<br>Class Name: ANTCOM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the best cultural anthro prof at DePaul.  She's very funny and fun to have a conversation with.  Also, she studies Roma women.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2008<br>Class Name: ANT304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You all are crazy! I almost didn't take her because of her ratings but she was an amazing professor. So amazing, in fact, that I chose to work with her on an independent study. Fair grader, interesting material. Always helpful and very thought-provoking. I HIGHLY recommend taking a class with her. You will be pleasantly surprised!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: INT204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Hofman is really awesome not to mention really smart and knowledgeable! She makes class fun and interesting, and does not assign ANY busy work.  It is very important to do the readings, not only for the class, but because they are authors and subjects every educated individual, especially in the field, should know. Highly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2008<br>Class Name: ANT300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accent makes it a little hard to understand. Lectures all class long and speaks entirely too fast to take  notes. Scatters thru lecture from topic to topic, interrupts students when they are talking, readings are entirely too dense for anyone who is not an Anthro major. Definately a BRILLIANT scholar, but not a good &quot;teacher&quot;.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Strict attendance policy, intimidating syllabus, but if you make it past the 1st couple of weeks youll survive. No exams, couple in class quizes, but mostly essay work and the main project:field study and presentation. If youre articulate, write well, and have an opinion youll get an A. Shes really fair/understanding, altho confusing at times</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: DISCOVERCHICAG<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2006<br>Class Name: ANTHROPOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is very nice and cute. boring class but helpful. she makes it interesting. a few papers but no midterm or final. a few homework assignments. pretty easy b but she's not that easy of a grader. i recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2006<br>Class Name: ANTHRO300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this is a great teacher if you like to think.

It was terrible.  I recommend never taking a class with her, and if you have to I feel bad for you.  I recieved A's on all of her papers, yet she still gave me a B-.  Someone please tell me how that works.  She is fine out of class, but in class she is terrible.  She also favors boys over girls.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This lady is insane.

Class will start on the nose and don't think of missing a class.  Keep up on the dreadful reading eventhough you will be bored to tears.

She is very disorganized and the group discussions are forced.  She says uh, so much that you want to poke her eyes out.  BTW, she will count off points on your presentation if you use, Uhhh, or ummmmm like she does.  Avoid her class if possible.
