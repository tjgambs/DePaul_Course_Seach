Keeps the class entertaining by joking around and poking fun at students. Calc II is somewhat difficult if you don't have an interest in the material.

He does make a lot of jokes but when taking a night class I think its important to have a prof that is going to keep you awake and engaged and he does. He is always willing to help and he wants his students to pass. If you go to him for help once he takes that into consideration when its time for final grading. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is passionate about teaching and passionate about Math.
