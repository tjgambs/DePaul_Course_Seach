The class is an intro to the real estate concentration, so nothing is covered with too much depth.  Freeman puts in a minimal amount of effort, doesn't grade anything.  He's definately more interested in his business than teaching, but if you keep the conversation going you can get some good info from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2006<br>Class Name: FIN530<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible Class. Professor only shows up half of the time. Won't help. Take another teacher. Doesn't grade anything, Class should have just been taught by the TA</div></div></div></body></html>
