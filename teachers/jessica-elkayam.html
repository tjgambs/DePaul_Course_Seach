This class makes you work for the grade. Readings can be very long and hard to understand. Be prepare for a group project! The professor is a wonderful person and clearly loves her field of work. I just found this class to be low priority, I took it to get it out of the way. But she makes you work!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Elkayam is one of the best. Her lectures are often mind-blowing and very constructive. She can describe very difficult philosophical concepts in  different ways so they can be understood. Her class challenged me to be a better person and look at life differently. If you do what she expects of you, which is reasonable, you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: PHL243<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Always available to students. Taking detailed notes is important if you want to pass the take-home exams. Class participation is expected. Make notes in the book and on the side - she checks to be sure that students read the assigned readings. She is an excellent professor and she is more than happy to work with you. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2014<br>Class Name: PHL243<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Would highly recommend not taking her. I have a 3 hour night class and she consistently let's us out 10 minutes late. Expect a ton of work outside of class. Her lectures are interesting and thought provoking but they are confusing at times. I would recommend against taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2014<br>Class Name: PHL243<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Even though this is a 3 hour long night class, I look forward to it every week. She really challenges your thinking and is extremely knowledgable on the subject. She's also really funny and makes class interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2014<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you read the readings with a basic understanding, it's easy to pass the quizzes. It's really just straight out of the texts. The texts used in this class is challenging. Ger grading on papers is even worst. & boring lectures. Attendance is mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: PHL201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Jessica will challenge the way you think. And yes, that takes hard work to do, and she provides it. People who say they don't like her are lazy students who don't like to read. If you need help, she is there and is willing to work with you. Take her courses because they are intellectually engaging and will challenge you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2014<br>Class Name: PHL204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a fan of this woman. If you're into PHL, by all means take this class. If you're just fulfilling a requirement, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. She's very stuck up. Do the readings to be prepared for the weekly quizzes which can be very hard at times. Difficult grader on papers. Boring lectures. Participate every once in a while.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Class is pretty challenging. Papers are not graded easily, and for non-Philosophy majors this class can be difficult. Nice lady but the material itself is challenging. Must read text for each class as pop-quizzes are often given weekly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2013<br>Class Name: PHL204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>She's an awesome woman and class itself is very fun and interesting, but she doesn't understand that all of her students aren't philosophy majors... you MUST read the text for weekly quizes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: PHL204101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>her explanations are more complicated than the actual text...</div></div></div></body></html>
