He is just brilliant! He's also really HOT and just a cool guy to talk to in general. He will help you out whenever, he is very accessible, and he extends deadlines easily.  If you hated English classes before, you will want to be an English major after you take his class, thatâ€™s how good he is.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great class discussions,..really makes you think!! always there to help you out if you're confused and extends deadlines very easily!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103AND104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a cool but but we never really got things done even if it were a 3 hour class.  The man's on campus most of the time and if you need help he does all that he can to stay with you after class or by appointment.
