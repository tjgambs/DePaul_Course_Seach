I found it interesting and he was clear in his presentations. No, it wasn't easy, but if you put forth effort and participate, you will do fine. I would recommend this class to someone with an open mind.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class can sometimes drag on but if you take good notes off his powerpoints you don't have to read and he explains it all really well. He is kind of a hard grader but it's a 100 level class so it's pretty easy stuff. I'm not a phil major and I did fine. Good Professor, he's helpful and knowledgable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seriously... for a 100 level class, this man is deranged.  I cannot think of anyone less interesting.  His clarity leaves us wondering whether or not he should be a professor at all.  Losers in this class, don't let the high ratings fool you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Some people in my class had a beef with this guy and I really don't get why. He's a philosophy teacher, of course he's boring. It's a philosophy class, it's going to be dead white guys rambling about stuff that doesn't matter. Get over it. Ross will help you IF YOU ASK.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not doing poorly in this class and I still think it's horrible.  He lectures for no reason other than to listen to himself which constantly reminds us that we do NOT want to be philosophy majors.  Attendance is required, can't be more than three minutes late. Doesn't use blackboard.  Whole class powerpoints but doesn't make them available.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's kinda cute. There is lots of reading involved. If you do not do it, you will be completely lost and will not be able to follow in class. Classes are lectures and some discussion. We had a debate. A few pop quizes, midterm, and final. We had a big class, so the relationship with the prof was kind of informal.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! He really cares about his students.  He let me turn in a paper late and I didn't get any points off.  He acts like he cares about attendance, but I rarely went and I got an A.  I never read and made up the essays.  Def take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is useless to begin with and the reading was a lot. But he is totally cute and was very helpful and sweet when I needed it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is defniitely not that easy. He has a lot of readings and he makes you write papers every week. But if you go to him for help on your papers he helps.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2007<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE... Ridiculous attendance policy. If you at 5 seconds late you are absent... seriously if he has just finished role. Forget it. He isnt cute, maybe if you like the dorky kind. Powerpoints arent really helpful and niether is he. Worthless class, worthless professor. Don't do it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Uses powerpoints. Reading assignment almost every night and a few writing assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this class. I wasn't sure what to expect when I started, but besides the material being interesting, Professor Ross really tries to help students understand. A few papers, but they were all really short. A third of the grade is participation, so make sure to speak up. The group discussions could be pretty fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2006<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This business ethics class was pretty easy. The reading is tedious but if you don't read the text, you can get get by as long as you really pay attention to what he says in class. Powerpoint, midterm, final, participation make the grade. Easy grader, focus on what he says instead of writing the notes, listen, speak up, and it should be no problem f</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate philosophy so i didnt want to take the class.  there are a lot of hard readings but he does go over them in class but his powerpoint presentations DONT help!  when taking notes, take them on what he says NOT what is in his powerpoints</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2006<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i don't remember anything he said. but he is adorable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Can be awkward in front of a class, but is very intelligent, and if you're lost/confused he WILL help you. Workload is overwhelming at first but  is balanced with movies and discussion, and is designed to help you in the end. I think lots of kids are uncomfortable asking for help because he's so reserved, but if you ask for help he'll be thrilled.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2006<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not recommend this one. He makes you work way too hard for a philosophy class that is just a  requirement you're trying to get done. You have to write papers every week and the texts he teaches are very hard to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He talked way too damn softly all the time, I think maybe he was afraid of our class.  He was kind of a nice guy, gave quizzes every week that weren't that hard but you needed to do some reading and pay attention in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked this class. He is a great teacher and he really helped me learn philosophy by taling about movies and modern examples. But he is definitely hard when it comes to grading the papers and the tests. If you come to class, take notes and try to figure out the kinds of questions he is interested in then you have a shot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unless you are dead, he won't accept a paper. In the ER&#63; forget it. have the flu for days on end&#63; forget it. This is the most stressful class I have ever taken. Exact quote about doing not too fancy on a midterm, &quot;don't worry think of it as a quiz.&quot; I'm sorry 20% is not a quiz!!Suck up, talk a lot in class, & don't dispute what he says theres an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hated the guy...he was sooo unclear at times and he sure did go off on tangents. He is very unfair on attendance and papers were hard!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was very unhelpful and unsympathetic to basically everything.  Horrible teaching style, no room for interpretation.  If you enjoy your sanity, dont take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think the last person must not be too bright cause I thought prof Ross was very clear at the way he explained things. for someone who didn't really understand or like philosophy before I thought he did a good job bringing the stuff alive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2005<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated him he was confusing and unclear at times..you ask a question and he goes of in a tangent on answering it and at the end your more confuse then you were before.

But for this class being a first year introduction to philosophy, I think he expects the class to go a little deeper into the understanding than another beginning course. He can be kind of picky the way he grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not as easy as people say.

Ross explains all the readings and is a fair grader on friday quizzes and essays. Readings not necessary because he explains it all.

He related most things we read to everyday situations and even showed parts of &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; and showed the entire movie &quot;Dogville.&quot;  If you meet with him about your papers, there's no reason you won't get an A in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2005<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: PHL234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nathan ross is a very nice, easy professor.  his lectures are pretty boring, but your grade consists of only 3 papers.  no quizzes or tests.  never really read, just went to class and took notes, and got an A.  i recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor, made sure you understood everything.
