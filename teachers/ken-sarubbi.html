The final was tough, but the rest of it was easy.  If you go to class, don't buy the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: PE206<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good fun class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2006<br>Class Name: PE206<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His kines/ath inj. classes are tough but this class is fairly easy. he tells many great funny stories and is very knowledgable about the subject. either you take doc for this class or you take kristen neisler. TRUST ME, YOU DO NOT WANT TO TAKE THIS CLASS WITH KRISTEN (or any classes with her). 2 exams and 1.5 paper. ***take good notes in class***</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: INJURIES<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes a topic that could be staright forward, quite confusing.  He needs to modernize his teaching methods.  Makes tests very hard!!  Study everything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2004<br>Class Name: INJURIESKINES<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doc is great. But you must go to class and take the notes. He tests mainly from class notes, but there will be a few random questions from the book. Basically you should study everything! All in all I would recommend him, and he is very available for those needing help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: ATHLINJ<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doc is a rare breed today. If you really want to learn take this class because he makes you work, but at the same time won't stick it to you if you really put a decent effort</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2004<br>Class Name: INJURIES<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>test were way too hard....make sure to read the book.....he tests things that are not taught but are in the book....he is cool and tells good stories but is just an ok teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2004<br>Class Name: ATHINJ<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very, very nice. His tests are very hard though. I guess it should be b/c the field is complicated.  You have to come to class and take notes *AND* read the book or there is NO, NO, NO way you're pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: PE<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gets off on the fact that no one can really pass his exams.  There is no reason for topics to be so hard.  He tests on things that aren't even taught in class.  He leactures in a very unclear fashion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2003<br>Class Name: EDU<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent, excellent, excellent.
