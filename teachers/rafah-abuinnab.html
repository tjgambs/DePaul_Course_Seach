    It was very frustrating and difficult that Rahfa would just begin speaking in Arabic without ever translating to English so it was hard to keep up. It would certainly help a lot if the curriculum was geared toward beginners; whereas it was taught assuming students already had general knowledge of the language. Also she is very unclear instructions.
