Mainly uses powerpoints for lectures. Midterm and final 1/2 multiple choice, 1/2 short answer. Research paper due at the end of the semester but has you turn in sections throughout to help. Got extra credit for going to every class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2011<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for Intro to Psych and overall liked his teaching style.

Class was boring and he doesn't explain the subject matter well or really teach you how to use Excel.  The lab assistants are much more helpful.</div></div></div></body></html>
