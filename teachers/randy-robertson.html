    His dog was cute and he wasn't too bad either.  As a teacher, he made some dull works pretty interesting.

    Wonderful teacher. Rather than letting English and grammar lessons consume you, he interweaves philosophy, current politics and existentialism into the class. We studied Freud, watched films like Momento and Waking Life and analyzed the Onion once a week.

    Class discussions were intriguing.  His discussion topic (focused on the first amendment) stimulates profound thought...awesome class for those who like to study politics -but a tough grader so be aware

    he is a good teacher but i did not like the class. although the class was bad for me, he was very interested in what he was teaching and knew a lot on the subject. if censorship is your thing definitly take him, he knows his stuff.

    Good teacher. If you wanted to participate this was the class to do so. Lots of arguments and challenging writing. If you try, you can get a B, and if you just argue you can get a C. He is very involved with political subjects

    HE IS A VERY INTERESTING TEACHER, HE LIKES YOU TO BE INVOLVED IN THE DEBATES. HE DOESNT REALLY EXPLAIN PAPERS TO WELL, NOT VERY CLEAR ON WHAT HE WANTS, HE USUALLY SPENDS HIS CLASS DOING NOTHING EXCEPT &quot;ONLINE RESEARCH HELP&quot; THAT IS IF HE IS IN C

    Good solid teacher focused on our rights. Brings argumentative ideas to the paper that fuel thought and the want to write with passion on an interesting topic. Political and argumaentative. If you don't like to participate, don't like to argue, bad class.

    Easy if you already know how to write - helps to be outspoken.  He's nearly obssessed with first amendment rights.  He caters to stupid people, so if you know what subjuntive phrases and semicolons are you may be frustrated with the class.

    He is an interesting and understanding teacher but, he is very vague about what he wants on papers.  He is a horrible grader, I still don't know exactly what he really wants.
