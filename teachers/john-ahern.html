I took his course online.  He'll work the breaks off of you w several assignments and quizzes, but such is to be expected for a graduate accounting course.  Whatever you do, don't get behind.  Class average on final was 62, but he grades on a curve.  He wants students to succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2013<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of not accurate information on this page.

The professor seemed a bit disconnected, very old and spent half the class in another country (So would I). Our class average on the midterm and final was a 69% and 65%, respectively, many people got a C or below. I wouldn't recommend this class,homework and quiz questions did not match exams questions. Take Frigo or Chomiac</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2012<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor !!

Study the quizzes for the multiple choice part of exams and he will tell you exactly what written problems to know. Knows his material very well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2011<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Professor. Teaches from powerpoints. Reading textbook is recommended since a lot of MC on exams will be conceptual. Tells you what kind of problems will be on exams and some MC will be exactly the same as the practice quizzes. I would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/04/2011<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took the online section and wasn't impressed until I watched his videos.  Very helpful.  The class can be tough and included weekly quizzes along with a midterm and final.  He is not exciting, but he presents example problems very well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2011<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.

Document a weekly journal that counts for a large portion of your grade along with several small tasks like turning in contracts on time. The final consists of a 15 pg research paper where you choose the topic. Nice guy. Pretty easy A. Counts for Junior EL and ACC elective. Recommend it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Ahern needs to stop rating himself. He will read from the slides. Gets upset if you ask questions, and then can't answer them. Tests are impossible and he is not interested in whether u learn or not. 305 is a hard class and DePaul needs teachers that can TEACH the material! Get into a study group this class is independant study!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quizzes were very helpful. Doing the homework problems and going through his powerpoint slides made me understand more. I only missed class once. Pay attention and work hard, and you will expect a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing Professor!I'm glad Iwas in his Acc305 class. I heard alot from his homework explanations and off from the lectures of his powerpoint slides. His ungraded quizes for each chapter helps alot to prep you for the midterm and final. I heard he is also teaching Acc372.=)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ahern is such an awesome guy. He has tons of experience in the field and is very knowledgable. He'll elaborate on anything you ask him to and the the exams are straight off of the UNGRADED quizes he passes out in class. His curve is extremely generous and tests are practical questions taken off the CPA exam. HIGHLY recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2009<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes he is difficult, BUT he will teach you stuff you will need to know. Honestly this is just a hard class, so suck it up. If you do your work, he will do his, and you will know this stuff forward and back. Period.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2008<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor. Nice guy. There is a fair amount of homework, but it relates well to exams. Tests what he teaches. Non-graded, in-class quizzes helped. The final exam took me and most of the class the full 2 hours but it was fair and students can do well if they study sufficiently. I recommend taking this professor if you have the option.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2008<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a joke. I think he is just waiting for his pension to roll around. Did not teach the class but read us slides he didn't prepare.. in fact he didn't even prepare his own tests and when asked questions didn't know the answer. Take a staff prof. because Cohen is even worse. A VERY HARD CLASS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2008<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a useless teacher. He reads powerpoint slides from the book the entire class. He doesn't answer questions well, if at all. I don't think he knows this material himself. AVOID. Exams are CPA level and with a fair teacher this class would not be too bad. This accounting prof. was a waste of my tuition money!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2008<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is tough, be aware.  However, if cohen is the other option, stick to this guy.  Midterm was 35 questions, took over two hours to do.  Was multiple choice, but they were straight from the &quot;CPA BANK&quot;.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: KGG365<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>his my homie</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2007<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor with a lot of experience in audit and related info. I took him over summer it was an easy A. All test questions are former CPA questions but if you read the text you'll do good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2007<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class very helpful failed acct. the first time, but he is willing to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good professor...get to know him.  he gives curves on the tests that really help...tests are hard though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As long as you do your work you will do well in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2007<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I benefited from this class. The cafeteria guy became my best friend. I spent more time with him than staying in class. Accounting is so boring it makes the word 'boring' look so 'unboring'! Prof. Ahern knows the subject very well, the only problem is that he does not know how to pass on the info</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2007<br>Class Name: ACC541<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Always takes attendance.  Went to visit him during office hours and was very nice and helpful.  Class was very challenging and you do need to work hard.  During class talked a lot about his work experience.  Went through problems that were on the exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor; teaches a dry subject and is willing to discuss concepts, problems, etc. in class, office hours, or over email.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives you samples of the types of problems you'll have to do on the test before the test.  Study them and his practices multiple choice quizes and you'll do fine.  I got an A with average effort.  Good professor and he will answer any questions you have.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is the same no matter who you take.  He was always good at answering questions.  Becareful he takes a full grade off if you miss i think it was 3 classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was not hard. Ahern tells you what problems you will need to work out on the test before the test. Study those and read and the class is easy. Make an effort to talk to the man outside of class he is quite helpful. Take Ahern if you would like to do well and actually take something away from the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For what it is, this class went well. This teacher genuinely cares about his students grades, and gives big curves on tests and multiple extra credit oppurtunities. Accounting is not an easy subject but Ahern does his best to make it better. If you study his practice quizzes and actually read the book from time to time you will get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: ACT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>its accounting & the prof can't help it but subject/class is very boring. goin to class is pretty much pointless but u get attendence pts. u hafta teach urself on everything or go to a tutor. bonus: is that he grades on a big curve & make sure you GO to the extra credit seminars (just sign in ur name). study the practice test, hw, and book a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he doesn't really explain the material well but curves the tests like crazy and gives opportunities for extra credit.i got a D on the first test but ended up with an A in the class so definitely take him if you want a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>to bad his class is mandatory, you will be better of teaching your self</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear in class while explaining problems.

He is clear, focused and has interesting, relevant stories to share.  I enjoyed his course.  Do the assignments, study and you will be fine.  He even lets you know the lay out of the tests and what you need to know for the problems.  I loved this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very boring professor, but that has nothing to do with his ability to teach.

Overall pretty good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was awesome.  He actually made class pretty interesting and explained things very well.  He was very helpful and understanding outside of class and I would highly recommend him.  I studied and read almost all of the assigned chapters and got an A, so it isn't impossible but you do have to do some work to earn it.  Great Professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this man, he is such a great guy. Yeah the class can be pretty boring...but welcome to Accounting. Definately one of the better Accounting professors. The class just sucks...it starts out pretty easy so you kind of blow it off. Well watch out b/c you can get lost in no time. Accounting just blows...but if you have to take it then take Ahern.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is a bit on the boring side, but he's such a sweet heart.

I definetly recommend him, he's not that bad. oh he does give u HW but he also gives u the answrs so be4 u turn it in u can chck it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not EVER take this teacher!
