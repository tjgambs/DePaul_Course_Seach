Exceeded my expectations! There were 4 quizzes, she dropped the lowest one. There was also a group project, which was great with a reliable team. Participation and attendance mattered because this was only 5 days long. She was very reasonable and nice. If you want to take a Dec Sess class, TAKE THIS ONE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the class over winter break. It was a week long and it was hard to like her at first, but by the end of the week she is one of my favorite professors! She SUPER helpful if you reach out to her. Class was an easy A. There is a group project but it is easy if your group members are helpful. I would recommend her to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2014<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>I was in the same section as the rest of you and I found Prof. Hartman to be super helpful and clear.  Yeah, there are assignments, but you absolutely know about them going in.  If you don't like the structure, you don't have to take this section. It kept my interest knowing her opinion than having teachers who pretend not to have one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2014<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, this was the worst college class I have ever taken in my life, and it was all due to this TERRIBLE professor. Do NOT take her classes. She is a conceited GPA killer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2014<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>The reason I took an online class was for the flexibility. By assigning a group project and an in class presentation, professor Hartman took that away. She is very particular about grammar yet she makes mistakes in most of her emails. She will tell you how she wants something done, but still give you a bad grade even when you do what she says.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2014<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was unfair for her to assign a group project for an online course, as my group could never find the time to meet and it is easier to blow your team off when you do not see them every week in class. (She should know that). I would not recommend this class to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2014<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst class I've taken at DePaul. She is super conceited (she wrote the textbook) and the work load is ridiculous. She is super harsh on grammar when she makes a ton of mistakes herself also. The group projects are a whole different story you don't want to get involved in because they will drive you insane. She's organized and will kill your GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2014<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: WD</div><div id="right"><div>As she even puts it, this is not an ethics course.  It's a leadership decision-making course.  She is a stickler on proofreading while her own comments are full of mistakes.  She is incredibly conceded and relies on her textbook (she is the author).  The class was poorly organized and sure to be a GPA killer, especially if you pick the wrong group.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2013<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>It was hard to like her at first, but her career and what shes accomplished is pretty ridiculous. I have a lot of respect for her and learned a few things. Only had 1 quiz and the rest of the time it was small hws and lectures. She wrote the book your suppose to read  so be ready to answer questions. Overall easy class. Curves a lot and is lenient.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2013<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rubric is so unclear, barely posts grade. Super conceited woman, and talks about herself all the time. Definitely is an interesting teacher though if you can get past her biases which she claims not to have.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2009<br>Class Name: MGT248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was very easy. The syllabus may make it seem like a difficult class, but it's really not. However, the only problem is that she basically only sources herself, therefore, everything is very bias and one sided. It's a good way to fulfill one of your philosophy requirements, but not a class I'd take for fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: MGT798<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My worst MBA class experience at DePaul. I had Ms. Hartman for a Leadership and Ethics class and I was so disappointed in the class of this professor. Ms Harman doesn't listen, lectures soley to hear herself talk and picks favorites. Much better professors at DePaul. As a so-called professor of ethics she is anything but...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2008<br>Class Name: MGTSECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is definitely one of the best professors I have had.  She is so smart, and also very funny.  She is personable, and you can sense that she cares about all of her students (all 60+ of them! .. classes are usually big) If you have the chance, definitely take her..the class is fun, interesting and not that hard...plus, you will learn a lot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2007<br>Class Name: BUSETHC<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS AWESOME. My favorite professor at DePaul. Her syllabus is clear and she lists out everything she expects from her students. EVERYTHING is in the syllabus. Very caring woman. Even though it was a huge class she still made it seem very personal. Dont come late and turn off your cell phone. Absolutely the coolest teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2007<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I mean...she's a good prof and all...but her head is a little too big. I will hand it to her, she responds to emails in seconds, but the group project was kind of ridiculous. I like her but.....eh.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2007<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING professor! She knows SO much about the subject and makes the class interesting. I was never bored. The midterm is a breeze as long as you read the assigned readings and her powerpoints and she curves it. The final is a group project which isn't rocket science so that's a nice change of pace. Definitely take her, she's a great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: BUSINESSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was amazing!  The syllabus is 40 pages long but don't drop the course, you learn sooo much and its pretty easy.  Your final is a group project that you have the entire quarter to work on, its a nice change to a final.  She knows so much about the subject and very willing to help you!  Best Professor i have had.  Attandance does count tho</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2006<br>Class Name: BUSINESSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! Class is not hard- Just short response papers and a group project. You will learn alot from her. She is the only professor who is truly passionate about what she does and it shows!! I loved her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: REL190<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very down to earth, great teacher, great experience.

ONE OF TE BEST CLASSES/PROF I'VE HAD AT DEPAUL!
