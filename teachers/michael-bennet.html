    Bennet is an older guy that takes forever to get your work back to you and when you get it back, the feedback is minimal if it exists at all. Told the class we could revise our papers, but never even gave them back until the end of the course. The final exam was take home. The entire class was just group discussion based on the readings.

    Amazing class, Professor Bennet has a huge history in community organizing and knows so much about the topic.  Wonderful guest speaker, reading is a lot (you can skim) and there is a 10 page paper due.  Final and Midterm are easy if you know the topic.

    Take Professor Bennett, decent amount of reading but the work is straightforward. Midterm, detailed studyguide was given and he posts on blackboard. If you attend most if not all classes you will get a good grade. Reserach paper, easy research an urban issue present findings to class. Final exam is a take home.

    Horrible professor. I took the class as an elective. It was easy but I learned nothing at all. The prof didn't seem to care about the class. I had a family emergency during finals and he never replied to my emails. Insensitive, and lackadaisical.

    He is very knowledgeable.  I enjoyed his class.  Although, I don't think he grades very fairly.  I should have gotten at least a B in the class and received a C+.  I was very disappointed.  Too many students in this class for the amount we pay in tuition.  3 components to grade: Midterm, 10 page term paper, and the final paper, which sucked!!

    His class is really easy &amp; he really knows his stuff. I really enjoyed it. He gives a very detailed study guide. Everything on the tests is on there so make sure you know the study guide. Only 3 grades for the class: midterm, 10'ish page research paper, and final.

    Very easy class.  I didn't care much for the material, but he still taught it in a way that was engaging.  The class consists of a midterm(he gives you a study guide with all the answers), a take home final, and a term paper that has to be at least 10 pages.  If you are a decent writer, you should have no problem getting an A in this class.

    Class teaches the intracate nature of social problems from a rational perspective. Prof was great; nice, easygoing, and intelligent guy. Although, I would have personally preferred if the class was a little less technical, and more theoretical--as to relate more to the &quot;big picture.&quot;

    wise, smart guy.... likes that students participate, all you havfe to do is write a 10 page paper on a social problem, take a mid term (essay based) and a final that includes all of the material. (you can redo essay if you didn't receive the grade you wanted)
