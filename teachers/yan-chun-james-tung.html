Class is not so easy but he is helpful and clear. Doesn't take attendance and doesn't collect homework but you really need to practice in order to do well in the exams and quizes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>teaching not clear, not helpful, and overly picky on graded group homework, easy group quizzes in which attendance is mandatory, but midterm & final are based on graded homework & he gives you practice tests that are exactly like the exams...very easy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best profs around. I didnt spend much time studying and I still got an A just from his class lectures. he goes over examples for everything and is very helpful with explanations.  Definitely take him if you're not good at math and need lots of help.  just make sure to do the homeworks and you'll be fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy is not easy, and he goes very fast. i got a B in the class, and with his class curve i got a B+. the class average on the final was a 61%. if u take him, a good grade is possible but he makes u work very hard for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Tung is a fine math teacher and the people who say otherwise are the lazy ones who never attend class.  He goes over everything and is very clear about what is expected.  If you do the graded homeworks you will do fine.  Let him see that you are enjoying his class and he becomes a lot more fun and relaxed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  Helps if you need it.  Typical class consists of him giving new info., then doing example problems with the class, and then the rest (quizzes, homework, and exams) are based exactly off what he teached.  If anyone has had a problem with him, they just aren't trying.  I think he's one of the best math teachers at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate math and Im really bad at it. I took this class, and I never felt bad about it. He gives group quizzes, take home quizzes, one midterm, and one final. If you do your homework, pay attention in class, and do good on the quizzes you WILL get an B or A. Hes a good math professor. I would take him again for another class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ok</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to work hard and get C- then take him or take  Kuziel Ronald for bms 126 and  get A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is very hard. He will not help you and does not want you to succeed</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>How is this man a teacher&#63; The entire class failed the midterm so I think that says something. I've always been great at math...until Mr. Tung. He can barely speak English, if you ask a question he will say &quot;you already know that&quot; and move on. He wouldn't let us leave class during a fire drill. He will not dismiss class one second early. Not one!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is horrible. He had to curve all of our grades. There are quizzes every week and they are extremely hard. Two tests mid-term and finas. If you don't understand he doesn't care just keeps moving on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you can't understand English/accents don't take him. He has a thick accent. He's extremely easy. He grades easy, he will help you on the test and if you disagree with a quiz score he'll probably change it. Nice guy. I missed class often and still got As and Bs. I'm not gifted at math, but I study. If you don't study you will fail any math class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he isnt clear when he lectures and his writing is really small so sit in the very front. he doesnt explain the material well at all, and I had to learn most things from the book. If you know calculus, then take him, but if you need a prof to explain the topic so you understand it, find another prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really hard class--didn't help that he flew through the material, didn't explain things well. Expects several students to drop to even out his curve--only curved at the very end of class. Final was HARD. Did not care about students or their performance. Definitely avoid him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not as bad as the people who have no idea what they are doing say. He is a little hard to follow, but willing to help. The class is a bit difficult, but he curves big time. Overall, nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is willing to help you out office hours but midterms and quizes are hard. like someone said class average was a D. But if you are good at calc take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is really bad. He gives weekly quizzes and homework plus 1 midterm and 1 final.  He doesn't care if he has to fail the entire class. The average on the midterm was a 61%.  I had to drop it because I had no hope after failing the midterm. VERY HARD CLASS. If you have any trouble with math or need a little extra help don't take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>absolutely the worst teacher ever. He is not helpful outside of class! He grades Homework after you hand the assignment in. DO NOT TAKE HIM AS A NIGHT CLASS! he is dry and boring and very monotone! I would not ever take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2006<br>Class Name: WRC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All though I stink in math, he was reaaly nice. He tried to help me to understand to the best of my ability. His hand writing is very small, so make sure you sit at the front of the class. Overall, he was a good teacher. I also dont think he is hot he is o.k, but I chose it, because I thought the not was mean.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teaching style, clearly explains certain topics, and tries to present information in a couple different ways... if you're taking wrc204 just because of the stupid placement test, he's the guy to take.. his lack of attendance policy is great for those who know what they're doing.. highly recomend him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2006<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice professor but the only thing that i thought SUCKED big time and made me get stuck on few problems is that he does not allow the us of calculators on tests or quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2006<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the cutest little professor...you just want to tickle him.  he's a very clear and concise teacher...extremely willing to help.  the homework and quizzes are easy, and so is the midterm.  take him if you can!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very niceeee guy! he is extremely helpful.
