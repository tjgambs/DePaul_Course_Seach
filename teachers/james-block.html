His teaching style is very different and takes some getting used to (Socratic Method). Look that up if you are not familiar with this style. You will learn how to think in his classes, I mean really think hard. Classes are not easy by any means, but very fulfilling if you have read.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2013<br>Class Name: PSC300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's amazing. There is no professor like him at DePaul. He is an incredible thinker and will change the way you see yourself and the world. His classes are not for the faint of heart. He pushes you to fulfill your potential. Don't make stupid comments or talk for the sake of talking but do participate. A must for PSC majors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: PSC235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Block seems challenging and intimidating, but he really warms up to the class. He is very knowledgeable and engaging with his class. If you are a PSC major, you should experience a class with him because he deepens your critical analysis skills and builds skills needed. If you do the work, make arguments and provide evidence, you will do we</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: PSC235<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Block is the best! Not the convetional professor, but makes you expand your horizons without much force. There is a decent amount of reading and short papers to do, but it's interesting material...I'd recommed him to anyone, poli sci major or not...Class behavior might be intimidating to some, but when you talk to him, he's very nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: PSC235<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was overly monotonous.  I was shouted at by Block on the first day and told I don't know what I'm talking about. Kept us there at least 5-10 minutes after class EVERY CLASS. Reading was not relevant and very heavy. 3 papers plus quizzes on all readings before you get to discuss - if you don't nail the quiz - you are marked absent. DONT TAKE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2010<br>Class Name: PSC219<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Three classes with him, and I always experienced a positive change within myself. His teaching goes beyond receiving knowledge. It's transformative. But, be warned, that his teaching style seems unorthodox sometimes, and he is definitely big on the socratic method. Beyond getting grilled and trying to understand his teaching method, its worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2009<br>Class Name: PSC236<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof. Really asks you to expland your mind. May come off as an easy class, but a lot of people weren't happy with final grades. Write well thought-out papers and participate A LOT and you'll get an A :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: PSC219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You have to go to every class and do all the reading, but IT IS WORTH IT!! He was very interesting and lectures were more like class discussions. Everyone participates and gets into the subject matter. He is truly one of DePaul's best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2009<br>Class Name: PSC219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. It was my first time taking a class with Block and it happened to be one of the most memorable classes of my college career. To call him  'inspiring' is a heavy understatement. I wish I could take him for every class. I love Block!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: HON300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>PLEASE take him. You will have to think a lot, but you'll really examine your own beliefs and learn a TON.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2007<br>Class Name: PHI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>interesting books, makes u think, a bit too pedantic though...STIILL TAKE him if  uwanan  truly examine ur beliefs...good teacher!!!! one of the few who actually makes an impact on you and really cares!!!!! TAKE him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2007<br>Class Name: PSC234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very interesting teacher.. I'd really like to see inside his head, cause I bet there's some wild stuff in there.  Will make you write and read a lot, but if you do that and have a mind of your own, you will be more than fine. Class will either be exhausting or fun.. rarely a dull moment.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2007<br>Class Name: PSC235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes everyone uncomfortable at first because nobody LIKES questioning their own beliefs. You'll be happy you did. Even if you don't end up changing your beliefs at least you will have examined them by the end of the class. Try to take him early in your college career because you will want to take more classes with him. So worthwhile.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2007<br>Class Name: PSC234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want a class where you do not question anything and except everything Professor Block might not be your best choice.  However, if you want answers about yoru life and scoiety in general you will truly enjoy his teaching style.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2006<br>Class Name: SOC235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down....best teacher at DePaul!   Take him if you ever get the chance!  One of the smartest people I know.  Look up his credentials...amazing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: HON300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first i was terrified and hated him as a teacher, but give him time. He will challenge you to think in ways you never thought you would and you will walk away from his class a more well rounded person.  He actually does care a lot about the students and their learning but chooses to challenge you or even piss you off in order to make you learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2006<br>Class Name: PSC234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What else can be said about the man&#63; I didn't like him ONE BIT for the first 3 weeks. But now I'm taking a second class with Block. He really has his own theories figured out, but he's more concerned with YOU reaallly trying to challenge your beliefs. His classes all have different subjects, but they're all essentially the same. His rants are funny</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2006<br>Class Name: PSC390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great thinker. He presents philosophical arguments and encourages thinking beyond the normative boundaries</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2006<br>Class Name: PSC235<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best teacher I have had at depaul. anyone that doesn't like him is probably just lazy.  His classes are extrememly thought provoking.  I hope i get the change to take him again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2005<br>Class Name: POL300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An amazing man, and a freaking genius.  Ties together so many seemingly unrelated threads and trends and writings and then all of a sudden it hits you and you see an idea in a totally new way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: HON300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy.  You gotta be able to deal with his randomness in terms of assignments, but his class was invaluable to me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2005<br>Class Name: PSC239<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the best teacher I have ever had in my life. This man actually looks like Socrates, and he also matches him in wisdom. He simply won't accept laziness and therefore weeds out all of the people that don't belong in the class (and probably college)to begin with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2005<br>Class Name: ISP212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting and thought-provoking.  Difficult if you can't or choose not to compete with students in the course who already know him well and or have something to say about everything.  Participation is very important, so speak up regularly.  Allows you to choose your paper topics and wants you to think for yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2005<br>Class Name: POLISCI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Block is amazing.  He makes you think.  He makes you aware of stuff that typical American Society does not want to deal with.  Even though i'm not in his classes any longer, I still consider him my mentor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't think of taking this class if you don't plan on doing the reading.  I think he tries to weed out students who are hoping for an easy grade during the first class (our class size dropped significantly).  Stick with it, though, it is worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2005<br>Class Name: PSC333<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Block is interesting to say the least. He yells sometimes instead of lecturing, he's often so loud that you can hear him through the wall in the next room. My problem with the class was that it seemed a lot more philosophical than it did political. It seems like everyone either loves him or hates hi</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2004<br>Class Name: PSC300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unreal how much I learned from him, great guy and just as good at making you think, although if you are not a talker I would advise u to find some one else. Block is the man when it comes to poly sci, he is overall a very smart man. enjoy his banter and comment from time 2 time and u will do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: PSC231<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good guy, albeit an awkward class.  Some conversations are genuinely thought-provoking, but fly by too quickly to really sink your teeth into.  Very little direction in the course (which is good!) but if you aren't into pretentious, &quot;elevated&quot;-student-speak, you may become a little lost.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2004<br>Class Name: HON300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Block is a good guy, but the class got annoying. There was never any answers for anything despite his selling of the course as a &quot;lab/lab-like&quot;. Interesting, but hard to swallow a lot of his explainations. Also (like almost the entire poli sci department) he's a raging liberal/communist.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: POLTHOUGHT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best if the not the best teacher at depaul. he makes yo really think. he demands everyones best effort.

If you don't plan on doing the assigned work he will not only call you out in front of the class, but he might even tell you to go home.
