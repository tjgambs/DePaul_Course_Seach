She is sort of nice in the beginning, but after awhile she just kind of turns mean. I feel like I am 2 in her class. I do not feel like I am learning anything. She is an ok teacher, but not the best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2007<br>Class Name: EE384<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Once she has you on her bad side it is pretty impossible to get back on her good side. She lets you know that she is the professor and you are the little student. It can be difficult to learn from a person that doesn't have mutual respect for her students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: EE324<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very approachable, wants students to succeed.  Bought one of the text books and used it for final assignment and that's it.  I was placed in a class that was beyond the level for the course content so found disconnect between classroom studies and clinical experience.  For best experience all around, I would advise requesting a younger grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2006<br>Class Name: EE324<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It gets REALLY annoying doing the kiddie lessons every week, but it kills time. I got more out of doing the clinical for the class. Mrs. Bartel is OK, but she kind of drove me nuts. She's annoying. It's just a class... she's not the worst. Take her. You'll get a B+ or better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2006<br>Class Name: EE324<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You spend the entire quarter acting like a preschooler instead of learning to teach young children, also don't be late. M.Donovan is a better instructor.You will learn a great deal more, more work is required however the reward is far better(better instruction & attitude)Beware of her. DePaul should oust her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2006<br>Class Name: EE324<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can get some helpful information from her, but it's like pulling teeth. She has been out of the elementary classroom too long, it is soooo obvious. Her preferred use of an overhead projector and blend, small type transparencies does not go over well, especially since she was always stressing how to make presentations more interesting. Model it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2005<br>Class Name: EE324<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not too bad if you just go to class, turn in stuff on time and for feedback, and participate.  Just show some interest and she will give you respect.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: EE324<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bartel is NUTS.  She talks and treats you like a dumb kindergardener.  If you can take this class with DONOVAN.  Bartel's class is probably a little less work, but she's just a really hard grader and extremely unorganized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: EE324<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I worked extremely hard and received a B in her class. It was my first B ever. I do not feel that this class was helpful to me in any respect, and I wish I had taken it with another professor. And yes, she very much does pick favorites.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2005<br>Class Name: EE<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice person & helpful at times but her class frustrates me because she forces students to take on the persona of a pre-schooler all through class. There is more emphasis placed on acting as a child than there is on teaching to children. I often leave the class frustrated and unsure</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2004<br>Class Name: EE324<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, what a horrible woman. If you are a brown-noser and love to suck up than take her class. Otherwise, if you would prefer to keep your dignity than DONT TAKE THIS WOMAN. She is nasty and picks favorites the very first day. If you are not one of her &quot;chosen ones&quot; than skip out and take someone els</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: EE324<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the best education professors ever. She is enthuastic about her job and also helps prospective teachers really well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2004<br>Class Name: EE324<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The absolute best professor I have had. She is very effective and very helpful for not only English but for teaching as a whole. I really enjoyed her and I do respect her a lot. She enthuses you for teaching!!</div></div></div></body></html>
