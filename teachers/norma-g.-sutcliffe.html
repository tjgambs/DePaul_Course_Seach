    She is a friendly, understanding professor who takes the class with real world practicalities. The concepts can be imbibed by students with her happy lecturing. Just loved it.

    The class is easy, the assignments are easy, the lectures are long and unfocussed messes that spiral into jokes of yesteryear. Easy class, poor teacher.

    I learned a lot in her class. If you do all of your assignments and participate you can easily get an A. Homework assignments requires some research. Final was challenging the materials were boring and required reading multiple times to respond appropriately. The mid term paper was brutal as well but overall the class was good.
