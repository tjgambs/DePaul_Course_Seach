That being said, discussions are tedious and often dry and repetitive. Professor Mayo is a nice guy, but as another person said, he seems to lack knowledge outside of the required readings and so on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm sure outside of this course he's fine, but professor mayo couldn't stimulate any interest and the work load was tedious as hell. he's unclear and repetitive, and even though he's a nice guy, this class really really sucks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was an absolute disaster. His teaching is dry and uninspired. The amount of work required for this course was totally unjustified. My peers had zero interpersonal skills, and we were thus forced to endure his monotone rambles for 3 hours every Tuesday night. He's very annoying with how much of a geek he is and I hated everything he did.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2013<br>Class Name: ANTH1110<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't suggest taking his Intro to Anthropology online. He has basically zero interest in the class, the syllabus was copied and pasted from a previous class where almost every date was incorrect (and he does not correct them), and he will not respond to attempts to speak with him via email, etc. When it comes to grading, he is tough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2011<br>Class Name: ANT109<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class and teacher. Hes really nice and happy all the time. Class was slightly boring but if you attended and took the quizzes online with an open book its hard NOT to get an A. Attendance is important though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had him for Godzilla vs Them. Discussion was often tedious and full of awkward silence. His knowledge of the subject matter seemed rather narrow outside of what was in the readings. Didn't feel like I learned anything, it was a lot of stating the obvious (of course, it is a freshman gen ed class).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2009<br>Class Name: ANT105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Mayo is awesome! I'm not gonna lie, I am kind of a slacker and I still did really well. I loved this class! All you do is watch a movie then answer this sheet with like 4 questions about the movie. You also just have to take notes on discussions that you turn in. I highly recommend taking him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This section was on Urban Multiculturalism.  Dr. Mayo knows his stuff and can be fun in class.  He always asks for us to get involved, but once we;re on a roll, he seems to stop us.  It often felt like I was BSing some of the writing assignments, but I did learn a lot about myself in class.  I was surprised at how much I liked this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: ISP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Class, most interesting class I've taken thus far. Nice prof. who is very Helpful(if you seek it). He can come across as a bit pompous at times, but its not too bad. He seems to be a fair grader, do what he asks and you should walk away with a good grade. Overall I would recommend him and this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2009<br>Class Name: ANT109<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pros: Very easy work, gives relevant notes in class, nice professor, assignments were crystal clear.  Cons: The material covered was not discussed fully in class, some videos were not relevant to the topic (but fun to watch!); Overall, I would take him again if given the oppertunity, I liked the class and learned some stuff too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2008<br>Class Name: ANT172<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this man is a terrible teacher and doesn't give any clear answers to the questions he asks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not recommend this professor to any one. Each class we discussed the same ideas and concepts. He is nice at first but its not really genuine. He is an arrogant man that does not grade very fairly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Even though class was awkward most days he always finds a way to keep the discussion going. Gives many chances and is an over all nice guy. Video's seen in class are interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Mayo is very nice and knows a lot about race and ethnicity, the topic of our sophomore seminar.  Classes can be kind of awkward and he says he doesn't want to rune our class discussions, though he always seems to jump in just as things are getting good.  Easy grader and good teacher.  Take him if you want an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2007<br>Class Name: ANT109<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class could be great if he would just teach it. I mean 1 or 2 videos EVERY class only means he doesn't have very much to say. No real issues are probed, although the subject calls for MUCH discussion and deeper understanding. He is also dyslexic - or simply cannot spell - which makes for some odd quizzes and handouts. He is a nice guy though!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: ANT109<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool professor. You have 5 quizzes online and one oral presentation that's it. Easy A just pay attention in class and on oral presentations. This is what the question for the quizzes are based on. Every class there is at least one movie that's about an hour long. Definitely take the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2006<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you came here to see if you can get an easy A w/ this prof, the answer is yes. However, if you're looking for a professor who likes to teach the subject material, stay away. We watch movies that are only somewhat relevant&he shies AWAY from teaching the material in the book, when that's what he tests us on. Hm. I wonder why the tests are online.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2006<br>Class Name: CULANTHRO<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was pretty easy. The class is really interesting. He tells some lame jokes but he means well. I would reccommend him. Watched a movie every class period. Be prepared because he randomly calls on people.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: ANTH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SUCH a nice man. watched a movie EVERY SINGLE CLASS. pretty interesting stuff, though. let us out early all the time. only 15 question online quizzes. one paper, online final+final paper and that's it! lots of the course material was stuff i never knew.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He leaves all the important essays until the very end, which worked out well for me but it is a little nerve racking. He does online quizzes all the way along and you have to do all the reading to do the quizzes well and they count for a pretty big percent of your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: ANT109FOOD<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not say it is a true blow off, but it is a easy class. You need to come to and listen. the test were a little hard but you do them on blackboard. The paper was not bad and I hate to write papers, and the in class presention was an easy A. Just go to class listen and participate it is some intesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: ANTHROPOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2005<br>Class Name: ANT100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this man, i dont know what these people are talking about, he lets you out early of night class, he's expectations are not set to high for the class, and overall a cool class. tests are easy, readings arent bad, and you watch a bunch of movies</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2005<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class/professor.

He wants the papers to be very basic and to the point, and he gives you a STUDY GUIDE for the exams!  Fill it out in detail, and you're set!  He's very intelligent and can help you if you really want to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: ANT<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took his class as a night class.

Just readings throughout the course mostly. Pretty easy, considering not everyone does the reading hw. A couple in-class discussions. But towards the end, he piled on a couple essays.

(night class) incredibly boring.  Midterms/Final online and, don't fool yourself, they're pretty easy.  Study a little then take it, you can use all your materials!

I can honestly say that I didn't learn anything. He was very rude and spoke to the students as if they were 5 year olds.

Class time was a waste-I would have been better off just reading the book by myself. Also was rude and insulting to students-very unprofessional. He also talked down to us-made me feel like I was in grade school instead of college.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decent teacher, although towards the end of the quarter he seemed to get pretty aggrivated with students in class over small, unimportant things.  Didn't respond hardly ever to emails although he encouraged the class to send him them regularly, and the online tests were pretty difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: ANT109<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By the time I realized that I hated this class, it was too late to drop it. Watching movies that are intended for elementary school kids is insulting and uninformative. He was offensive and often insulting to other students. I got an easy A, but that's not what I pay so much for. A waste of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: ANT109<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked the class in the beginning, but towards the end he really seemed to lose patience with us.  He got really mad at the kids who did not participate and he sometimes singled out people and enbarrassed them.
