Not only was the material boring, the class was a lot of work. However, Prof. Kostantaras did the best he could to keep the class entertaining despite the sheer monotony of 3 hour lectures. If you must take the course, choose Kostantaras.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2012<br>Class Name: HST173<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This proff is the one I'd like to bump into at a bar and take home with me.  Besides that his class is boring and its easy to daydream.  Theres a quiz every week, that you will pass if you do the readings. One paper, 2 exams.  This guy is not gifted in presenting an exciting lecture, although he is very knowledgable. Hes ok. Not bad. Not excellent.</div></div></div></body></html>
