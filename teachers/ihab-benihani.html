He is more than willing to explain things multiple times. He likes participation, if he asks a question in class, actually raise your hand and answer it. His sense of humor is kinda lame, but go with it, it will make him like you. Overall pretty easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2008<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He will trick instead of teach you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2008<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good Instructor, he wants to teach you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2008<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Labs and homeworks are helpful, but lots of ambiguity. Midterms are very tricky, watch out! Not fast on returning emails.  Has a bit temper issue. Can't judge objectively about teaching, I took it after CCNA completion. What is up with that coat he is always wearing&#63;&#63;&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: IT263<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unfortunately, he was the only one teaching this class this quarter - so he was our only option. Got an A, but I would still avoid him at all costs unless you don't care for your &quot;overall class experience.&quot; Very unprofessional and disorganized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2007<br>Class Name: NETW250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy very strict with bad jokes. Don't kid around with, he takes it personally. He tests were completely out of this world (hard). Really did not learn much from him, lectures were BORING. Study guides were GOOD. Overall, he SUCKS, avoid if possible.</div></div></div></body></html>
