She lets you learn your own way while not being an easy "A" because you still have to put forth effort. I have learned new perspectives that I will never forget. You would be a fool not to take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Every week you do some short readings that relate to the in class lecture then you write a response paper, she gives you some sort of guideline but its truly up you what you want to respond to. You must read and you have to do the weekly papers. I wouldn't take this class with another professor. seems hard at first but her expectations are clear. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is really an "easy A" AS LONG AS YOU DO THE WORK.  You have to write a 3 page paper every week along with readings, which she provides (yay no textbook).  Though it takes a while, you get a lot out of it and her lectures are quite entertaining.  I would recommend taking her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The LSP 200 class seminars are known for sucking but her class was awesome. She was bursting with knowledge and actually made philosophy interesting. Her papers seemed to take a while but they weren't hard. If you miss a day she's always willing to meet with you for make up credit. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Danielle is the best lecturer I have ever encountered.  She is insanely intelligent, funny, honest to a T, thoughtful and shocking.  She has changed the way I think for the better.  Take her, it would be impossible not to love her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Prior to signing up for the course I had absolutely zero interest in philosophy, but Danielle changed that! Extremely passionate and knowledgeable. Work consists of reading articles and writing a 3 page response every week, if you work at it and pay attention, there is no reason you shouldn't get an A in the class, take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I have ever had, extremely passionate, honest, helpful, cool, and nice. First time I've ever actually looked forward to going to class. Only homework is reading articles and writing a 3 page response per week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: PHL240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly passionate, intelligent, and fair. She bends over backwards making all of her lectures understandable and applicable to everyday life. If you do the work, show up, and keep an open mind you are guaranteed an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2013<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took "Phil. Approach to Multiculturalism" with her. She's an amazing teacher! You are expected to read an section (20 pages tops) and write a 3+ page paper using discussion questions she posts. Very manageable! Easy to get 100% if you understand the material. Would totally recommend this class and professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2012<br>Class Name: PHL280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DM is one of the coolest, most intelligent, wise beyond her years people you will ever meet. I love her and her class even though we see things completely differently</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2012<br>Class Name: PHIL280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her! She has the best personality and makes you really interested in the material. You read and answer questions everyweek. I do end up writing a lot and it kinda takes me a while but Im sure people could knock it out way quicker than what I do. She made me think about the world in a different way. Really happy I took her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: PHL280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is AWESOME!!  One of the greatest professors here at DePaul. She is engaging and you just find this new world, i cannot even describe it. There is soooooooo much reading though it is unbelievable and homework every class but as long as you read and take notes you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: PHL280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Meijer is a great professor. The lecture is engaging and interesting every class. She is very helpful and answers any questions. The weekly work is not hard at all, mostly elaboration on short readings. Great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: PHL280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Professor Meijer.  SHe made class fun. Appreciate her honesty and i always refer to things ive learned in her class in other classes.  Her class was not easy but it was not hard either. I will say  put forth about a 6 for effort and got a B.  Take her class she is really great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2011<br>Class Name: PHL280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a pretty good teacher which will have you engaged in the topic at hand. Overall a fairly easy class, just make sure that you do the readings. I learned a lot of things through this class and would highly recommend it to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2010<br>Class Name: PHL280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a great teacher, biased but she explains why that cannot be changed. The class is easy, if you pay attention and do the readings then the papers are easy to write. Only four papers are required. She has strong opinions which make the class interesting, plus she is funny. I would recommend this class. I got an A easily.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2010<br>Class Name: PHL280<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whow, can't believe RMP deleted most the negative reviews.This is another &quot;honest reviewer.&quot; waste of time, didn't learn anything, spend your money on another class where you'll learn  something and the teacher has some facts to back up her claim and open to different viewpoints.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2010<br>Class Name: PHL280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DM is wonderful. Its easy to teach a bunch of logic but brave to teach about how to live real-life. This was a class about how to live & think about life today. DM has talent & heart; can change your life. Haters & LSAT study-preps don't get it or her! PHIL is supposed to change your life & question statusquo! DM goes out of her way to help!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2010<br>Class Name: PHL280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>&quot;Honest Reviewer&quot; The professor was awesome. She had weekly quizzes from readings that had questions that can be answered with common sense. She provided maximum assistance for both the midterm and final. I got an extremely lenient grade even though I didn't take advantage of her assistance for the midterm, but I did for the final. Overall, 10/10!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2010<br>Class Name: PH280<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated every minute of this class. Research paper is due weekly, along with a TON of reading. She wants critical thinking yet, doesn't allow you to express your opinion. She just talks and talks about topics no one is interested in... so sry I took this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2010<br>Class Name: PHL280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Critical thinking class: Absolutely awesome professor. You will not get out of this class without learning a lot about the world and yourself. You will also have to use your brain. But she is awesome, informative and very helpful. She wants her students to succeed. She really cares and is really knowledgable! great class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2010<br>Class Name: PHL280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>her bias is def not liberal if you took her class you should know that. she is vegan and communitarian, but she shares that bias and allows for discussion and opinions. good teacher involves students in discussion and makes you think about life deeper than you normally would. i liked her class and shes a cool person in general.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2010<br>Class Name: PHIL280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DM cares about critical thinking & her students. She shares her bias to be fair (vegan, liberal) & teaches with passion. Smart & funny! Makes you think about real life & makes you _work_. Plus: cupcakes! :) Great class!</div></div></div></body></html>
