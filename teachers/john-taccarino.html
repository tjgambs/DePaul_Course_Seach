First, it's a research class, so if you were expecting to be entertained, I think you should have known better. Dr. Taccarino is a little bit quirky, but if you can appreciate that and see that he at least tries to make the topics interesting, the class isn't the worst thing ever.He is very nice, too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2008<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, the class is very boring but as someone already said, it's a research class so there's really no way around it. This guy really knows what's he's talking about and is extremely helpful. He's also very nice and not at all arrogant. He's even funny in a weird way... Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2007<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Look, it's a research class. So take that into consideration when looking at interest level. Taccarino knows what he's talking about and helped me with my paper when I needed it. True, the class is very cut and dry but if you follow his instructions, you will pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2007<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very boring and monotonous but a nice guy.  Stresses participation in the syllabus but he does all the talking.  Final grade is all in one paper.  Just glad I had an extremely attractive girl in my class to look at or else I would've lost my freakin mind.  Easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2007<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bad. Bad. Bad.  He is very out of touch.  Find a different professor to take this class with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2006<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>most BORING class you will ever have to take--sit in the back and balance your check book or get work down for another class.  Easy A--final paper is your entire grade (I think his TA grades most of the papers) Also, he has an attendance sign in sheet but I don't think it affects your grade at all---I missed a lot of class and still got an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2006<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really nice guy, but his class is boring.  Easy A, but you really don't learn anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2005<br>Class Name: SCG<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy might be from mars, but at least he knows what he's talking about.  You'll like it if you're a math major, but otherwise you might be left in the dark.  Lectures can drag on, but he's a fair grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2004<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst class ever.  We should get paid for attending.  Very dry, boring and arrogant.  Talks for three hours straight in monotone.  Calls in sick right before class, and his assignments are useless.  I got more from reading the intro to the book.  Class is req'd but this prof is not.  An easy A.</div></div></div></body></html>
