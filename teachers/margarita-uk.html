Prof. UK is awesome and makes class entertaining! You can tell she is really passionate about SQL and cares about her students actually learning. She will pause after teaching to make sure everyone understands before moving on, which is a good thing ifwhen things get confusing. If you do the work, you will get an A and learn SQL.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2015<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2015<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've had at DePaul University! As long as you attend the classes, do the homework & projects, you will easily pass! She is always there to help with any questions. Meets outside of class whenever necessary. Very friendly and easy to talk to. Gives opportunities for extra credit throughout the semester. Highly recommended!</div></div></div></body></html>
