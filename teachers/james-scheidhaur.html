    This prof. explains the material well and goes at a pretty good pace. He puts the various concepts into perspective (explains that we don't actually know what energy is, for example). He's easy (took him in the summer tho ?everything's easy then). He's a bit too congenial with his students: has us call him Jim and he calls us his friends. NBD tho.
