    This class requires a lot of effort and should only be taken if you are pretty serious about writing.  That being said, she's hilarious in class and is always very clear with what she expects.  She doesn't actually grade you based on how well you write which is nice, she only cares that you are making an effort and doing the assignments on time.

    Take her. She will help you improve your writing in ways you didn't think possible. I'm a much more critical reader now as well. Workload is absolutely manageable, you have to go to class but the time flies. If you have an opportunity to take her, do it; I'm hoping to take another class with her in the future.

    Too good. Also took ENG 201 and ENG 309 with her. Considering the entirely manageable amount of work that she gives, I was surprised by my level of improvement as a reader and a writer. Strict on attendance, but honestly I enjoyed every single class. Plus you'll read some amazing stuff. If you're an English major, a class with Pittard is a must.

    She's wonderful. She seems intimidating, but she KNOWS what she's doing and she'll do everything in her power to make you a better writer. She's a really genuinely nice and funny person, highly recommend

    Both approachable and candid, and like others have said she's a master at the workshop class format. One of the few cases where being a writer first and a teacher second is a good thing. You feel like you're in conversation with an author in her workshops, not being taught by a teacher.

    Hannah is an amazing writer and professor. She is down to earth and creates an atmosphere in the classroom that is open, fun,full of knowledge. She helps us get to know ourselves as writers with constructive tips that she has picked up from being a writer herself. This was my favorite workshop, and class, Ive ever taken at DePaul. Hannah is great!

    I only bemoan that I cannot take another workshop with Hannah after I graduate in June.  Runs the best workshop at DePaul.  If you want to write, take this class.

    I love Professor Pittard, granted I think she can come off as intimidating, however she has a very easy going nature and a fun quirky sense of humor. I would love to take a class with her again.

    I have had Hannah for 3 different classes, and I absolutely love her teaching style. She keeps it light and open, which is great for the workshop atmosphere. She is tremendously insightful, and has a great sense of humor. Talk, get your work in, and you will love her too.

    One of the finest writing workshops I have been in at DePaul.  The group of students helped, but she did a fantastic job, in my opinion.

    She's a very approachable professor.  It's easy to get comfortable in her class, she keeps the environment very accepting (which is mandatory for a discussion based class). She picks great work to learn from and has a pretty quirky sense of humor. Show up, talk, write the best you can, and her classes will rock your world.

    Professor Pittard's teaching style is very modern.  She keeps things fun and utilizes fantastic literature.  The downside to her class is the copious amounts of online responses we had to submit post-class about the discussion and reading.  I'd recommend her class (and she's a great writer, too!).

    A kind professor with considerate comments, but problematically defensive.  I don't find elementary school quizzes on the plots of contemporary short stories at all useful in a fiction WRITING class.  Personally, I wish her the best as a writer and instructor.  Professionally, I will not waste time in a course with her again.
