Do the readings so you can participate, and use her feedback to improve your papers and you'll do fine. She's super nice.

Definitely recommend if you want to take this class online. She's very quick to respond to emails and everything is organized very clearly into weeks so you don't fall behind. Great professor. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the kindest and quirkiest professor I've ever had. She is very encouraging and is easy to contact. She works at the Writing Center, so she is especially great at giving feedback. There is some group work too. I definitely recommend taking her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: WRD<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i couldn't say one bad thing about prof. finstrom if my life depended on it. she gives 100% of herself to her students, esp w incredibly thoughtful and sincere feedback. you can tell she seriously values everything you write. her style is on POINT, she is a killer poet, and she brings snacks.....i considered flunking just to take her class again. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2015<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The entire class is a joke. You have one big research paper over the course of the class. You will not learn anything from this class. You will not benefit from this class. You will regret taking this teacher. She is part of the WRC so she always thinks she's amazing when it comes to writing. Take a different teacher for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Finstrom is really helpful and give useful feed back! She is clear about her assignments but not clear in her lectures. I don't feel I learned anything about writing during the lectures. But she is super friendly and nice, and she know it when you make an effort. And she is an easy grader. And she put off the deadline sometimes too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful teacher! By far one of the most positive experiences I've had yet at DePaul. Very helpful and patient. Course consisted of a lot of writing but she gives lots of time to complete assignments and gives good feedback. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dont get me wrong, she's a great professor, but I couldn't handle sitting through a single class. Also did not feel prepared for the final at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2014<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Jennifer is a good professor who is extremely passionate about writing/ rhetoric. Loves the DePaul community. She's quirky and very understanding. She is willing to work with your timeline, and offers constructive advice on your work to help you get an A. Slightly boring at times, but you can't really go wrong with taking her course.</div></div></div></body></html>
