I sometimes find myself slipping in and out of the discussion though. Articles he assigns aren't of too much importance..I usually don't read them. Overall, he's a pretty good professor; he just teaches a topic that's kinda common knowledge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny guy, just he teaches such a boring topic.  His downfall is expecting students to participate in a class they don't care much about.  Led to lots of awkward silences.  Still a nice, easy teacher, though.  His middle name's Bruno, that might win him points, too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful and knowledgeable.

I'm not joking!  I'm shocked he doesn't require a feeding tube and constant primary care attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2007<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Strange little man-His classes should be on line because listening to him is like listening to grass grow.

We waited for the guy for 35 minutes and he was shocked we left.  In four years I've never had a prof. be late for a final.  How long were we supposed to wait, 2 1/2 hours!&#63; AND he made everyone come back and take it, though it was his fault.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: CMN251<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome.

I do NOT recommend taking his class. He does not respond to emails and is inconsistent with information. Also, he assigns way too much work and does not return it in a timely manner (very frustrating!). There are many great CMN Prof's, he is just not one of them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a cocky jerk who should move back to australia.  he doesnt explain anything clearly and makes stupid assignments that must be done in class or you dont get credit.  i dont recommend taking him at all i did not learn anything and he think hes funny but really just annoying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2006<br>Class Name: CMN251<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is a jerk!

If you can only take one class in your entire life (because maybe you're poor), you should this man.  He was both a friend and a mentor.
