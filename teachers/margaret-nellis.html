Take a different focal point, you'll realize how creepy the subject matter is way faster than you think. It's a lot of mindless busy work that stresses you out because of the sheer amount...types her lectures out before & tries to sound like a novelist.

She is unbearably quiet and has awful handwriting. She is very opinioonated and often chooses material that endorses her position, if you disagree with something in the article, even if it is regardless of opinion, she will tell you that you are wrong.
