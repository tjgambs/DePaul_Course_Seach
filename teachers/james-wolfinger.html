    Good class to learn some of the main themes on how to teach history. Essentially you analyze a high school book every week, write an analysis paper, give a group analysis of chapters etc... Over the top with analysis though. Pretty good class for the most part, but as is the case with most of them, there is a reason he is a former teacher.

    The best professor and most valuable education class I had.  Wolfinger is challenging, funny, and knowledgable.  He provides the most directly applicable strategies to teach history in the classroom.  He has a hilarious arrogance, but he is nonetheless very supportive.  He really acts like the kind of teacher that many of us aspire to be.

    Great teacher. he is a bit of a tough grader but makes the class very interesting by integrating clips of music and tv shows as well as websites to his lectures. so long as you study the notes you will do well as everything that is tested on is in your notes. I recommend him to anyone willing to put in the work.

    Prof. Wolfinger is a great American history teacher.  He really knows what he is talking about, and he actually makes class very interesting.  He assigns quite a bit of reading, but the readings are very useful (even in other classes).  Overall very fair with his expectations and definately worth taking.

    Good teacher. Demanding of students, but you will learn a ton in here. Well organized and asks good questions with laid back discussion classes. Participation is big part of grade, but not hard to do.

    By far the best teacher I have ever had at DePaul. Unique, smart, fun to listen to. Demands hardwork, but he will bend over backwards to help you if he sees you are willing to put forth the effort. AMAZING man. (Pretty attractive, too.. kind of looks like Dylan McDermott)

    I really enjoyed this class, the 60's are fascinating, and he keeps the discussions fresh with good prompting questions. The 5 page paper seems a little long sometimes for the assignment, and he graded them mediocre. There is a LOT of reading, but you can skim. PARTICIPATE in class! It's a huge part of his grading! He is also very laid back...

    Incredibly interesting class. You learn about sex, drugs and rock and roll. There is a lot of reading and he expects you to do it and keep up. Do the reading and talk in class and you will do fine. I would reccommend this class and teacher.

    Excellent. Knowledgeable, interesting, fair. A great mix of lecture, discussion, student presentation, small-group work. He had students write rough drafts and edit them in groups. Never a wasted moment in this class. Highly recommended.

    He's a great teacher, knows what he's talking about. I left knowing so much more than I ever knew about history. He is tough teacher, though. As long as you do the readings and study, you'll be fine.

    He's really nice, but there are no outlines or study guides...so beware...there 3 quizes on random, 2 tests (midterm &amp; final), a rough draft, one paper, and he doesn't take attendance, but most of his exams are based on his notes and lectures.

    HE IS GREAT TEACHER.  KNOWS THE MATERIAL VERY WELL.  LECTURES ARE CLEAR BUT REALLY LONG.  CLASS IS BASED ON LECTURES AND NOTES.  IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN HISTORY, CLASS GOES BY FAST.  IF NOT, I DON'T SUGGEST THIS CLASS.
