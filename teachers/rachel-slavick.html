    I really didn't appreciate this teacher at all. She had no respect for the students in the class, and it became very evident that this was because we weren't theatre majors. The class itself was very easy, but she takes herself far too seriously, as well as the course material. You could not pay me to take this class again.

    Rachel is a great acting professor. I had a hard time warming up to her at the start, but once you start to understand how she works and critiques you'll be fast friends in no time. DO NOT take this as a blow off class. She is VERY serious about participation and attendance and she knows if you're slacking. I had to work for my A.

    I absolutely loved her class! The activities we did were interesting and fun; she does a great job creating a comfortable environment for non-majors to perform in. Her class is very improv-oriented (unlike some other PRF 290 classes) but it inspired me to check out improv theaters around the city. Definitely take her class if you get the chance!

    Hypocritical. Self centered. Her personality and communication skills ruin any part of class that would otherwise be fun and helpful. Some exercises seem to contradict each other.

    This was my favorite class!! Slavick is the best drama/acting teacher I have ever had because she actually cares and you can tell. She breaks everything down so that you know exactly where you need to improve to improve overall. She makes it so fun and understands that her students are not actors and may be nervous to get up in front of people.

    Kind of the Artsy-fartsy type. We never actually did scenes, we just walked around the classroom and were supposed to feel different.. Easy A, but most days are just so dull.
