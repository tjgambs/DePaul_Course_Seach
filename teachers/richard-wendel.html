He makes this weird noise in between his words, it sounds like a combination of a cough and a smirk and it's so weird. He spends way too much time talking about things that don't relate to the lecture, however he is an easy grader. I just wouldn't take this class in general. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2014<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Very into his material!
