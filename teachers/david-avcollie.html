He was an amazing teacher, clearly committed to enhancing our learning experiences. Outrageous and courageous, fearless really, exactly the kind of truth you need to be an actor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: THTRMFA1<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I studied with him in 1990. He is a festering boil on the butt of humanity. He played favorites, picked on some relentlessly. One minute he would compliment, the next he was yelling in someone's face, even if nothing had changed at all. He was insane. Hell is a class under him for eternity. I actually had to have therapy after one year with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2009<br>Class Name: THEATTHEA<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was David's student in the early 80s  so we ar going back a few years.I remember David's passion for acting ,particularrly Shakespreare, and how his excitement was infexious to the clasroom. He promised a free lesson to any returning graduate. I am looking forward to that lesson if i ever catch up  to David.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2008<br>Class Name: ACT1<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>David clearly had favorites-witch in some cases was baffling.  He was repeatedly abusive and rude, almost on the verge of crazy at times.  Super erratic.  Loved it when you brown-nosed to to him. Ultimately, he was my reason for leaving DePaul. It was a very unhealthy environment.  I wish I could have had a better experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: ACT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man abused me and my fellow students mercilessly and needlessly. He should not be allowed near any living being which has the capability for thought or feeling.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: VOICE<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exhibited very seriously inappropriate behavior.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2006<br>Class Name: DRAMA<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst teacher I have ever encountered.
