Gave a quiz, midterm and a final.  if you screw up on quiz or midterm, he'll have you write a paper to boost your grade. can't get any easier than that. true, he doesn't really teach well, but i wouldn't complain if I got an easy A. If you truly want to learn about econ, take another prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have any interest in Econ, stay away!!!  He knows nothing about it, even though he has a PhD.  He got stumped alot on easy questions and had to ask students for the right answers.  He is a joke, do not take him.  Many students said they felt dumber after his course!  DePaul should give us our money back for this guys incompetence.</div></div></div></body></html>
