The class was lecture heavy, but it was very interesting so time flew by.  His wealth of information in British History resulted in a bunch of stories that he would sprinkle into each lecture.  Only 3 papers, and no tests, extremely fun class... take one with Prof. Beiriger if you have the opportunity.</div></div></div></body></html>
