    The negative review on 220 below is so wrong it's funny.  The poets we read include Spencer, Milton, Pope, Keats, Eliot, Pound, and Baraka -- pretty damned good &quot;reps of their eras.&quot;  Z is also HUGELY knowledgeable about his subject.  Really, students embarrass themselves when they pretend to know more than they do.

    Definitely one of the best profs at depaul -- super smart.  Write two explications, which you can revise, a midterm and a final.  He talks about prosody a lot (meter and rhyme, etc.), and reads everything from the Renaissance to contemporary poetry.  He writes about experimental poetry, so that definitely influences his teaching.

    His reading poetry class is great -- he covers tons of material and really encourages you to see poetry in a new light.  Be prepared to read a lot.  His expectations are also pretty high but he's always ready to talk about your papers and will let you rewrite them.

    He's a really smart guy and is always able to see the other side of an argument.  The class was all discussions and writing papers. Be prepared to write ALOT.. I've had the class for like 7 weeks and have written 8 papers... No tests, finals and midterms are case studies

    I had Reading Poetry w/ him. 2 midterm papers, 2 final papers. Although the daily grind was easy, he takes attendance, the poems he chooses are usually poor reps. of their eras, he isn't exceptionally knowledgeable of classic poetry, and he's a fairly tough grader. A nice guy, but boring and moderately tough to get an A in. Proceed w/ caution.

    Zamsky is great- he knows a ridiculous amount about what he is teaching and is always willing to edit drafts of papers.  Very approachable and not a difficult grader once you know what he's looking for.  I would highly recommend him to anyone!

    I thought I'd written a really awesome paper, then he covered it with criticism, and then I rewrote it into a better paper. I don't know what grade it got because that was my final paper. You should be able to handle criticism! Peer review sessions let me see how other people write; I didn't want to know. Missed class when his daughter was sick.

    The class was a bit boring -- its on research and argument.  but he was great.  He comments on all the papers and tells you what you need to work on.  He really knows his stuff and is very helpful especially if you talk to him one on one.  I will definitely take his poetry class in the fall which I hear is great.

    readings and papers are frequent and fairly boring. he acts like a dick one minute, then chippy the next. if you have the chance to take him for English 104, run for the hills. for the love of God, run for the hills. P.S. - never ever miss a pointless peer-grading workshop because he will drop a full ****ing letter-grade. like my from B to a C.

    I've taken several classes with Z and I've loved them all.  His 366 class was great -- we read some hard poetry, but our final papers were on pretty much anything we wanted.  The class was a good balance of lecture, discussion, and small-groups.  A LOT of information, but very interesting.  You will definiely learn something in his classes.

    This professor is pretentious and teaches behind a perpetually disapproving, faux-French sneer. He is quite brilliant in a way but he's also narrow minded and uninterested in a dialogue that doesn't reinforce his own opinions. I personally liked him but keep in mind that he's not a poet, he's a critic- intelligent but rigid and uninspired.

    He's got sort of a group of followers, and I am one of them. He is an amazing poetry professor...I've taken him twice and have no complaints. He will challenge you to think and write about your opinions, but will never shoot down a new or interesting idea. TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN...you will be inspired.

    I've had Z for several classes, and they've all been great.  He is very smart and passionate about his material.  I think some students don't get his style -- he can seem arrogant because he directly challenges conventional expectations.  Take him with a grain of salt and you will DEFINITELY read poetry in ways you never have before.

    Professor Zamsky is very smart and clearly is an expert, even though his specialty is poetry.  His method is really unique and helps a lot, and his comments are helpful.  I really did learn a lot from this class, and it's challenging in the right ways.  I'd definitely recommend him.

    He gives too much work but it helps and challenges you. He expects too much from his students but he also offers more than what is expected of him. He is willing to help you but you have to do the work. He is sometimes repetitive and boring. Also, he gets pissed off easily and storms out of the classroom. But he does care. You will learn a lot.

    One of the smartest people I've met. This arogance comment is strange, I could see how he could seem a bit supercilious if you aren't used to academics. He not going to walk you by the hand, but what good does that do us anyway. I pay good money I want to be able to think on my own by the end of it.

    I learned so much from this course. He is full of knowledge, and while he was a little bias at times, it wasn't enough to make me not like the class or him.  The class wasn't to difficult and papers weren't to bad.  I would take him again.

    No one read in the class and Zamsky knew it. He would ask questions about stuff and we would just sit there in silence for minutes waiting for someone to magically have the answer. the class had a real awkward vibe and he would be real arrogant if he felt you were wrong. caused people to not talk.

    arrogant, pompous, thinks he is smarter than he really is.  Seems to treat the girls with more respect than guys from the get go.  Asks you to think about and answer questions on the reading in an unopen, uninteresting manner.

    Zamsky is an awesome professor. He is challenging, but not hard. The readings are boring, but deal with it, you will become a really good writer. He is a GREAT teacher to have for your first college English class. Don't be afraid of him or his class. He is very nice and wants to be helpful!

    Zamsky teaches a good class.  He’s a pretty easy grader, if you do ur work your fine. i felt bad for him because our class didn’t really respond to his questions and he would get a little upset... plus he told us he speaks French so that and the fact he's oddly attractive made the class more fun.

    The class is not easy.  There is a lot of reading, and his lectures are complicated.  But that's the point -- only take him if you're up to the challenge.  If you don't want to learn anything new, don't bother with the class.

    Wow.  Great professor.  He was a bit harsh on the grading, but he really taught you how to write well.  Letting your grade suffer slightly here is well worth the non-stop A's in the rest of the courses which you WILL receive if you work hard in his class

    He helps you through all of your papers.  Really knows what he's talking about.  One of my favorite teachers at DePaul.
