He teaches GAM 226 Game design for majors. The class is fun and filled with everybody majoring in Game Design. He hasn't taught before but works in the industry at Robomodo as lead game designer. He has lots of connections in the field and I recommend getting on his good side so he remembers you. Assigns reading but you dont need to read</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2011<br>Class Name: GAM226<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked his class. He taught game design from a practical perspective and was friendly with students. Had a little bit of a hard time controlling the class due to the fun aspect of the content.Learned more from him than I could with any textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2010<br>Class Name: GAM226<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was a nice guy that is actually making videogames. He hadn't taught before. the class was pretty easy a one page paper due every week.

We only met once a week for three hours. At first he lectured for too long, but by the end he figured it out. Not a bad class. had a paper due once a week, only one page long. The exam wasnt bad ether.</div></div></div></body></html>
