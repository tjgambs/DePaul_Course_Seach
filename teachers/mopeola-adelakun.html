She gives a lot of homework, and little time in class to do them. Also the class uses SPSS and Microsoft Access so expect to have to go the library a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2015<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great person but it was hard to understand her lectures sometimes. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>If you go to class, you will be fine. There are tons of assignments and homework, but you get class time to do it all, and if you pay attention for a little while and follow her examples they're a piece of cake. A midterm, final, and one short paper. If you ask a question she will go through each step to make sure you got it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Not bad professor. She could look intimidated but she is pretty straightforward with what she wants. I took this class when I first transfered to DePaul with a different professor and she was worst. I had to drop. Now I took LSP 121 again with Mopelola Adelakun and I liked her. So trust me if I can pass anybody can pass, just do the assingments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take her!!! Her lectures are not helpful at all, student have to learn by themselves. She lectures sometimes for full period and than you have to do the class activity which is actually a home activity in addition to homework. Not worth the money!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>This class was EXTREMELY boring.  Although she is incredibly sweet and provides very helpful answers to your questions, it's just a nightmare.  You come to class and sit and listen to her lecture in monotone for a solid 70 minutes and then do an in class activity on the material.  Bring a pillow.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>I would not recommend this teacher at all. She is very boring and is not clear at all. Also, she keeps her students in class even if they finish all of their work and have nothing else to do.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mope is amazing!  She cares about her students and is extremely knowledgeable about the subject.  She makes this stuff fun, giving a bunch of little in class assignments to help you learn. Tests are easy too. She remembers her students and wants them to do well. Highly recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Adelakun has a thick accent and does not always project her voice, so I recommend sitting toward the front. She is extremely clear on her expectations and on the course material. Attend class and ask questions, and you will get an A! She is sweet & has a great sense of humor, while she tries to make the dry material somewhat interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a great professor.  She fails to explain many of the concepts well or in-depth.  On homework, I found myself teaching myself. She screen locks you out of your computer every single second that she speaks. Unclear: takes away points points for not showing work, but question won't specify to show work. Does not respond to emails in time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was one of the worst classes I have ever taken. I am sure she is a nice person, but as a professor she is terrible. She will not let you redo assignments if you got a bad grade, and will not help you with homework. I have never hated a professor more in my life than her. She makes this very confusing to understand as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Adelakun was great! Class was super easy! You learn MS Acess, SPSS,  binary, probability, and algorithms. There's an EC project which is easy and fun (can choose any topic for it). Midterm/final are super-easy! Class activities and hw are given each time!  Take her! Sit in the front row and you'll understand and hear her just fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible.  If you can avoid do.  Does a horrible job at explaining material and homework doesn't match what is learned in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2012<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LSP 121 with this woman is a horrible experience.  By far the most dreaded class I have taken.  Those 2 classes a week were ominous. I literally had to force myself through the door.  Her lectures are needlessly long, and you rarely have time to actually use the software.  I personally taught myself every thing in this class bc she is a poor prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2012<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Frequently late to class, Rarely returns graded work in a timely manner. Often spent entire class periods talking, leaving us 5 minutes to do an inclass activity, on top of a hw assignment.  Vague instructions in broken English litter her assignments and slides. A bad experience. Run for the hilla.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2012<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is AWFUL!!! Avoid her if you can, she lectures for an hour you can't understand a word she is saying and then she expects you to complete an assignment. She is a tough grader, and laughs at you if you ask a question. She also showed up over 5 minutes late on the day of our midterm and couldn't understand why none of us could finish it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the easiest to understand, but she's very kind and helpful. Lectures are dull, but she's very nice/non-intrusive if you want to bring your laptop and surf.  Grading's pretty easy.  While she takes attendance, you can get by without paying attention, just checking her slides and some of the book -- you're good (I got an A).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2011<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hard to understand. Doesn't konw how to teach very well. SHe doesn't give good directions- just very hard to understand in general.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2011<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID HER. This teacher is awful. You cannot understand a word she says, she never gets up to help anyone, she is a tough grader and marks you down for everything. Her lectures are dry and she shows no enthusiasm.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid.  Other posts are very accurate - poor communication (and I can understand her accent just fine), disorganized.  I often left the class with a feeling of &quot;what just happened&#63;&quot;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is so boring. Lectures are dry, she isn't really helpful at all. In class group work doesn't help either. It's frustrating for me, because she doesn't really explain things clearly, in terms of how to solve problems, or how to use the programs. I do not recommend this teacher, so save yourself,and save your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Abandon ship! She obviously knows how to use the programs herself but is incapable of teaching to others. Lectures are long, hard to follow and she goes on tangents. She doesn't answer emails and is occasionally rude. She's not worst but I would suggest finding someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2009<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I must not have the same teacher as the one reviewed here. Difficult to follow class lectures. Students corrected prof many times. Midterm and Final somewhat straight-forward, Had to rely on my own study notes to learn anything. Lectures are dry and incomprehensible. Wouldn't recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2009<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easiest class in depaul university! if you did good in business stats, you will so ace this class...good gpa booster.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Despite the fact somebody misspelled her name here... she is a very nice person and always willing to help you with any questions you may have, if you did well in BMS146 (bus stats) this one will be an easy A for you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: IT223<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This instructor is highly unprofessional, extremely incomprehensible, and outright ridiculous! She posted a midterm in the .doc format that was unreadable, she required us to resubmit our assignments several times, final she said she will post it by 6 p.m. of Friday and due by 8 a.m. on Saturday! it is 7:30 p.m and still nothing!
