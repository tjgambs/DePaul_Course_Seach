I've never met a more friendly, passionate, wonderful professor. His stories are great, and he values the opinions of every student that talks in class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: ENV150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Liam is easily one of my favorite professors at DePaul. He is extremely inspirational and very passionate about teaching and his work. He's helpful, understanding and has some great tangents. I've learned a lot in his class. I would definitely recommend him. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2014<br>Class Name: ENV150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most fascinating professor I've had at DePaul. Liam strives for the success of his students and has so many humorous/enlightening stories to share along the way. Wether or not you're a env sci/studies student.. if you have a SSMW credit to fulfill, like to read, and are somewhat interested in the ideologies of wilderness and space, try this course!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2013<br>Class Name: ENV217<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class. You have to read 4 books and they are all TERRRRIBLY boring. Not many assignments though so if you don't mind writing a few papers, that's basically all you have to do. That and a very short presentation about an article you read. Easy enough, right?</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2012<br>Class Name: ENV340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love him!!!

I ended up loving it. The teacher is really nice and keeps the class pretty easy. There isn't much homework and instead of an exam you can do a restoration activity. Loved this class, take it if you want a fun class with a nice teacher and not much work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this for my focal point seminar, thought it would be about buildings, but surpise, its about ecology. SO glad i kept with it, amazing professor and amazing class. its fun. easy work load, mostly class discussions. the most i've learned so far at depaul. Prof H is dope. great accent too. I'd take any of his classes in a heartbeat!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Restoration in Chicago was not of my interest at all for this class, I actually thought it was going to be about buildings, but then discovered it's about nature and ecology..but Liam is a great teacher and super easy.  Not really any homework except for some readings and online discussion questions, and few easy papers.  Easy grade & workload.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2010<br>Class Name: ENVSCI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Liam is a great prof!

There is a lot of material, but generally it's easy to grasp. Prof. Heneghan is a very understanding, helpful and funny guy. You can learn a lot from him. He uses a lot of powerpoint presentations, which, I think, is awesome... Midterm and Final were not hard and here is a research paper as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2008<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was great. it was fun and interesting. the work was easy but very useful. professor heneghan is a great guy. hes passionate and such a goof. i highly recommend him even if you have no interest in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2007<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures were great and kept my interest. Good prof... except for his extreme lateness in returning grades! On the day of the final I STILL did not know what my midterm grade was. Apart from that, I have no problems recommending him to anyone interested in the environment and evolution.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! He is really helpful and even though I wasn't into the subject matter he made it interesting.

Great Professor!  I really enjoyed having the speakers...they added to the subject matter and helped in putting it in a contaxt in the real world.  I recommend Dr. Heneghan to any student who wants to be taken seriously and encouraged to learn about ecology and the environment.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2007<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice prof. He seems dedicated to the students and really knows his stuff.  He makes you think and work for your grade, but he makes the topic relevant and interesting. I recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2006<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor.  He is inspiring and passionate about the environment!  Really knows his stuff and then some.  A real intellectual.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2006<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome person, amazing professor. loves his tangents, yet gives thorough study guides, offers additional explantations, and immidiately makes lectures available online. Presentations are fun and useful. The class isnt a &quot;gimme&quot;, yet his expectations aren't unresonable. If you don't get a good grade, you probably just didn't try!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: ENV200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was an excellent class. Although I didn't have much interest in the subject before the class started..he got me on board for the most part. He is very passionate about the subject, and if you like this kinda stuff you will be amazed. The class is pretty easy, just complete the homework, read the lecture notes, and you will be fine. Take Him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2006<br>Class Name: ENV<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this man.  I totally agree that he is sort of sexy in a bizarre mad scientist kind of way.  If you're into the environment or nature at all take him! He is so passionate about the topic, it's really inspiring. If you're not really into that stuff his class might be kinda boring but at least it's not that difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2006<br>Class Name: ENV<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intelligent, helpful, very easy going, and he makes you think. What more could you ask&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: ENV<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>completely unnecessary to go to class unless you are an insomniac that needs help falling asleep..as long as you know when you're presentation is(Super easy) and you print off and STUDY the slides for the midterm and final you'll be fine, he slightly looks like the mad scientist from Biodome. I'm pretty sure he gives everyone a B no matter what</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: ENVSCI<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so i pretty much didnt have any idea what the midterm would be on, since we talked about the same thing in different formats everyday. yet come midterm... there were 46 review topics (as in paragraphs and short answer) to be on the final.  funny, the powerpoints didnt reflect this.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him for explore and worked my ass off and got a B+ in the end. His grading is a little inconsistent because I know someone who got the same grade as me and didnt do half the work I did. I kinda made me mad. He's a genuinely nice guy though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2005<br>Class Name: EXPLORECHICAGO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: URBECO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A really great teacher. he wants you to frolic around the trees and do all the hands on things.
