    The WORST professor you'll probably ever have. Listen to the people who said he's unorganized. You will literally have no idea what to do when a test comes up.

    Most unorganized professor in the entire university. No D2L page. Lectures in a low voice. Goes off topic. Randomly yells in class. Syllabus is extremely vague. If you care about your GPA, avoid at all costs.

    One of the great professors of the past 50 years at DePaul. A top shelf intellectual historian of Russia who cares very deeply about ideas and learning. He's a brash lecturer but a modest man. Very grateful to have had a course with him.

    He gives a ton of papers each class so get a binder to keep it all organized.  Most of the essays are based from his class hand outs- not the book.  Although, he is an easy grader. Unfortunately, his tests are very, very hard. He is also hard to get a hold of since he doesn't email students or list his class on D2L.  It is a lecture class.

    Too many handouts defeat the purpose and add to disorganization. Everything that has been said so far from the year 2011 is very accurate. Pass.

    Very messy teacher. Needs more organization in his classroom. He is also probably too old to be teaching because he's also kind of senile. His teaching method makes this course a lot herder than it should be. Trust me on this one because this is coming from a student who gets A's and B's. Do not take his class unless you love history to death.

    Horrible professor. First of all he is very unorganized. He flip flops all over the place when during his lectures, and often brags about the &quot;hate stares&quot; he receives. He talks in a boring, quiet voice and will suddenly scream for about 10 seconds and get quiet again. His quizzes are also extremely hard and have nothing to do with the readings.

    Sippel is a crazy man.  Very boring class and he gives you 100 or more handouts that don't really pertain to class.  The maps and questions are easy, and the papers that are 50% of midterm and final are easy too, but the quiz is incredibly hard and the multiple choice for the midterm and final are extremely hard.  DON&quot;T TAKE

    Oh I agree with previous comment.  If you love history and this class makes you hate it that's how bad it was.  The teacher is just out of this world weird and seems to be off his game a little. Please spare yourself!!!

    Worst Teacher of all time. Makes it seem that the western culture is the most dominant culture. Has no organization. Makes you pay $10 xerox fee at the beginning of the course. His teaching style is from the 50's; nothing but a speech. Very hard to stay awake and pay attention in class. Test and Mid-terms have nothing to do with the course.

    I liked this class.  The lectures are boring and you will need like 3894024 folders to hold all of your xeroxes, but you don't have to buy a textbook, just two tiny novels that are both less than 200 pages.  1 matching quiz, but you can take 2 and he takes the higher grade.  2 take home map exercises, 3 papers total:1 is the midterm, 1 is the final

    The class is basically a complete lecture but he knows what he's talking about. Also a fairly easy grader. There was one matching quiz and 3 essays. Plenty of reading, but not necessary to read any of it. Hard to stay awake sometimes but he means well.

    Wow, I would not reccommend. His lectures are all over the place, he gives tons of random confusing handouts, and the multiple choice midterm had NOTHING to do with anything he taught. You have to know terms, maps, articles, readings from book, and other random materials- it's too scrambled and unorganized... take someone else!!

    He's a pretty informed older guy. He knows what he's talking about and gets really passionate and dramatic at times. He told us a story the other day about when he visited a temple in China, and his accent was impeccable! It was hilarious! I'd recommend him any day, but be wary of the heavy reading.

    This guy has been teaching at DePaul for like 40 years. He's really into his subject. If he gets mad while describing some event he'll actually start yelling at history's ethical failings. The class could have used a course reader. Instead there were lots of confusing hand-outs, and some weeks I don't think I received all of the week's readings.

    I still have no idea what this class was about, but I somehow was able to pull off A- grades on all of the papers. He's nice, but the lectures were pretty dull most of the time. Look out for the $10 Xerox fee...but you're likely to get a better grade if you reference the articles he hands out. If you have half a brain, you'll at least get a B.

    He's definitely eccentric but then again I kind of like that about teachers.  For World Civilization I he hit on sociological details I hadn't related to history before.  Definitely liberal but all of his yelling spells are an attempt to bring about debate.  Personally, I've learned a lot through debate.  Not for all students but I liked him.

    He charges $10 at the beginning of the quarter for 'copying fee' and proceeds to distribute multiple handouts with his chicken scratch handwriting notes that we're expected to read and understand.  Class is 'world history' yet focused mostly on religion.  Defines 'absent minded professor'.

    Too bad he hates anything coming remotely from the right. Uses confusing and irrelevant examples to prove his extreme leftist points. I wouldnt have a problem with him, except for the fact that he doesnt care about your opinion and wont give you the time to explain yourself before he dismisses you. A real disappointment.

    His tests are really random. You get two comments by two historical thinkers and you have to figure out which one said it. He literally starts to scream at the top of his lungs when he discusses a historical problem that he's excited about. What a weird, frightening, wonderful class. It's half spectacle, half history, and half confusion.

    Dr. Sippel is amazing.  He's really funny and helpful and he likes to scream.  He doesn't scream _at_ you, though; he just likes to scream _in general_.  It's pretty scary when he does that, but you get used to it.

Easy grader, selects great handouts, VERY into what he teaches, EXTREMELY WELL prepared lectures, yet sometimes on autopilot &amp; unable to answer questions/ lets you fall asleep. TAKE NOTES!

    Cornelius is a different type of Prof.  Sometimes I felt like I was in the war trenches, and he constatnly suggested that their was a &quot;bug&quot; in the vent.  Overall though, an entertaining Prof. with expereince in warfare.
