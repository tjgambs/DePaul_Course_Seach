I received little to know advising from him the entire time. The few times I did reach out for help, he made me feel like I was bothering him.

Incredibly rude and arrogant.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2009<br>Class Name: ECON102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very inconsiderate.
