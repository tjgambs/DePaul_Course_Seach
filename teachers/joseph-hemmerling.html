He improved my writing where I needed it and supported me in what I was already doing right.  A lot of papers to write and re-write but you'll get a lot of benefit from it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2011<br>Class Name: LL150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's always willing to help students and he gives you his home phone number so that you can call him anytime. Take him if you're willing to work hard and learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: LL150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His  teaching style is summed up as overzealous and ego driven. Syllabus started of with &quot;Kiss your family good bye&quot;, &quot;hope no projects come up at work&quot;, and &quot;tell your friends you will be gone for a while&quot;.  This is a class for adults, and the teacher is acting a like a kid! Unclear assignments. Re-do 3-5 page papers. Mixed directions, horrible.</div></div></div></body></html>
