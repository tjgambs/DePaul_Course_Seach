    Excellent Class.  The simulation is competitive and really takes into account a high level understanding of each of the foundation courses at DePaul.  If you want to learn about preparing and implementing a strategy, this is the class to take.

    You will be part of a large team to compete against other teams in a well-structured market (globally and locally). It will be intense, fun and worth your time. 60% of your grade is based on the team simulation and 40% of the individual simulation. Recommended take this course with him (+ he knows what he is talking about).

    The professor is too smart. He has so much good information and is very knowledgable. He does NO teaching in this class. All group work. I took the 4 days in a row class which was tough. Do not miss class. And there is a take home piece after the class is over worth 40%. Make nice with your group as they rate you. Doesnt post grades till last min.

    4-day weekend course is the way to go. Little teaching occurs as you are running a simulation in a group over the two weekends. Smart guy, lots of experience.

    One of my favorite classes. Almost the entire class is group work (during class hours) - there's very little &quot;teaching&quot; that occurs outside of that. Days are actually fun and go quickly --- wouldn't consider anything but the four-day class option.

    I loved this class. I highly recommend the 4 day class. Plaschka was rarely present but was always very helpful when our group needed him. Great class I learned a lot

    This class is awesome.  He isn't arrogant, just extremely smart and speaks on a very high level.  He expects you to know your stuff and won't explain it to you.  Honestly, the guy is brilliant...just expect extremely candid feedback and know that he expects the world out of you.  And take the 4 day intersession...that is key.

    Overall good class.  It was a nice change from the standard class format.  I actually did learn stuff about myself and group dynamics.

    This guy is awesome!  I definitely recommend taking the Saturday class because it is only 4 classes and time goes by quickly!  Your are with your simulation group almost every minute of the day, so pick a good team!  There are 4 short write-ups due at the end and its an easy and fun A!

    Very intelligent and caring professor who wants you not only to produce results ... but UNDERSTAND the process and how things happen.  Success is not happenstance and Plaschka makes that point.  The capsim simulation was a riot and he served as a wonderful coach to push us to our best performance.  I truly enjoyed it and would retake just for fun.

    Ok, so he didn't really teach anything, but it was a Strategy class.  At least he was rather entertaining.  He uses &quot;obviously&quot; and &quot;basically&quot; several times in each sentence; we actually counted almost 250 &quot;obviouslys&quot; on one Saturday class.  Overall a nice guy.
