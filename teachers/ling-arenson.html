Her thoughts were always all over the place and i could never follow her. She assigned a ton of reading that we never talked about or needed. Really hard grader on the papers. Im sure she is a nice person, but she was a terrible teacher. i would not reccomend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2013<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved the material she taught in class. The quizzes were really easy and the topics of the papers weren't that bad as long as you researched and outlined what you wanted to say. She was a tough grader on the papers though. you could miss a class and still be on track because she put all her notes on D2L.

Quizzes are ridiculously easy, papers are harder but still easy to get A's on. I rarely read the texts she provided, but once I did I fould them really interesting. Easy A if you read some of the assigned texts, complete quizzes, write papers, and raise your hand to answer a question once ina while</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2011<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is overall a nice person, but turns easy comprehensible topics into something that can be downright confusing. A lot of reading and a lot of it will feel unnecessary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2011<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not as horrible as some people make her out to be. Lectures are very boring and quizzes are difficult, but papers are relatively easy assuming you do the readings and listen to what she wants you to write. Lots of readings though, probably better history teachers at depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2010<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worst professors I've had at DePaul. She is INCONCEIVABLY boring, rude, and egotistical. She acts like she is above all of her students and seems to be in love with her own voice. I can assure you it would be a negative experience if you took her class. Even the kids that participate often enjoy her neither as a person nor a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2010<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>by far the worst professor i've EVER met. she literally took every ounce of interest i have in history and threw it out the window. be prepared to do a lot of pointless reading about topics that suck. i normally get A's on all papers and i got C's on every single paper in the class. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS unless you love boring annoying teachers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2010<br>Class Name: HST112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hands down the worst teacher I have ever had. Lessons don't make sense at all and she will sometimes say &quot;I know this doesn't make sense but...&quot; and she never goes into detail about anything. And she's a hard grader on things we never even talk about in class. Your GPA will suffer. Don't take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: HIS113<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS.

There doesnt seem to be any kind of order in the lessons. Quizzes are almost impossible. You have a lot of reading from different sources to keep up with.

Not clear, rude, and was NOT prepared for class. She does not listen when you answer questions and if you answer incorrectly she is very RUDE! Do not even bother studying for a quiz because she does not post the notes or give lectures enough time in advance for you to actually study them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2009<br>Class Name: HST113<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i would rather watch grass grow and paint dry than sit through her classes. she made my love for history disappear into abyss of the SAC somewhere.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2009<br>Class Name: HIST233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class was very informative; she is quite straight forward and knowledgeable about the history of china.

The movies shown are old, boring, & terrible. When you answer a question she doesn't listen and then just reads what she has written down. She says &quot;so anyways&quot; once she has realized that she has gone way off subject, after you took notes on everything she just said.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2008<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unapologetically biased, somehow makes history of all things boring and a losing personality on top of it.  She's really not easy either so you may want to ask yourself why bother taking her class and perpetuating her narcissistic existence and no-work job when there are other profs who're nice and actually do the material they're teaching justice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2008<br>Class Name: HIS000<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arensen is not all that bad of a teacher. She is fairly conventional in her teaching style, nothing different or too engaging, but the class was alright. She speaks English well, and generally sticks to the book. I do agree that she's very ethnocentric towards her ethnicity - Chinese. Overall, she's a fine teacher, but nothing stands out about her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: HIST233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I asked her for brief insight on topics within the final and she said &quot;I can't help you.&quot; She prepares lecture outlines that are not detailed at all. You can tell she is full of Chinese pride when she talks and to me it seemed like she talks down to students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2007<br>Class Name: HST233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she needs to update what's really going on in China since she teaches chinese history.I even knew more than she did. prepares class well, but when responding the quick questions she explained unclear, so don't expect too much from outside class knowledge. and as a history teacher, she really needs to be fair, but she's taking sides when teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2007<br>Class Name: HST233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arenson is really nice. You are allowed to miss up to 4 classes throughout quarter.  Midterm and final are hard. The amount of reading in this class is a bit much (3 books). But you learn soo much and you get to watch cool movies.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: HST262<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TALKS MOSTLY ABOUT CHINA, ALTHOUGH THE CLASS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

She's not a bad teacher just needs to make things more interesting and work on her attendance policy! She wrote down I miss a class and I never did!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2006<br>Class Name: HST220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's surprising to hear people say they can't understand her. Prof. Arenson speaks good english and she's pretty clear and focused in her lectures. She also seems to know a lot about China (obviously) and history in general. That said, she still taught like her students were in high school. Easy A though, if you can put up with that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2006<br>Class Name: HST233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Keeps referring to Myanmar as &quot;What we call today Burma&quot;. Only sticks to the textbooks and avoids challenging questions. Not at all an academic scholar and I'm pretty sure her accent is fake. If you want an easy class - take it. If you want to get your moneys worth from DePaul then don't. Modern China is important, but I feel like I'm in highschool</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2005<br>Class Name: PSHHHH<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She said (in a US HST class) that Scopes' trial was called the &quot;Monkey Trial&quot; because of the monkey-like, chaotic courtroom antics; nothing about the fact that it concerned EVOLUTION.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2005<br>Class Name: HST220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is a easy grader on papers but the quizzes you must know some info to pass those. Overall the class was easy (I am a history major and never read or studied). For nonhistory majors I highly suggest doing the readings to pass. I liked this teacher and have no real complaints. Also the people who don't liker her are really exaggerating.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2005<br>Class Name: HST219<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Called the Aegean Sea the Strait of Gibralter... not a very impressive instructor.

I had to study hard to even get a halfway decant grade of her tests. I actaully tried to get a good grade in this class and I ended up with a C, while in my other classes I got A's and B's.
