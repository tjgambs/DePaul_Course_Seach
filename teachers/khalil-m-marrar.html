Brilliant guy, personable and the class is highly ranked. Definitely do not need prior knowledge about the region, everything you need to know about middle east politics this class is the gateway.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2014<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, one of the best professors I've had. He had only four grades which were very simply yet enlightening. Easy grade and great learning experience. Class was interesting with Marrar, and he was more than helpful. I would definitely recommend him to any student of any major, but he is a must for PSC students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2013<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Marrar is brilliantly intelligent.  He is also a kind and thoughtful person. Im not a poli sci major, but I recommend him. He will be your friend for life if you take his class seriously. Best professor I have had at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2013<br>Class Name: POLS1500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Marrar is a very intelligent professor and you'll learn plenty in his class. He encourages a lot of classroom discussion on current events, so it's pretty mandatory to come to class if you want to get a good grade. He's very helpful; just go by his office during office hours with any question and he'll answer it for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2012<br>Class Name: PSC249<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably one of the nicest professors Ive ever had. His lectures can be a little confusing, but he is funny and will help his students no matter the time or the day. I would take him again in a heartbeat. He is incredibly intelligent and well spoken TAKE HIM</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2012<br>Class Name: PSC333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Marrar is without question one of the best teachers I've had at DePaul. I'm usually not one to participate, but he makes the class easy to attend and has concerns for the well being of each one of his students. If you come, you will learn, and you will receive a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2012<br>Class Name: POLS4521<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Marrar is young so right away he relates very well to his students. On top of this, he is extremely smart with Middle Eastern politics and conflict. His education combined with his experience makes him a great professor and one that I would highly recommend taking a class with. He is respectful, engaging, and funny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was honestly nothing like i expected. only two papers and a group presentation. no midterm or final. He was hilarious and made class go by fast, plus he  let us out early from our four hour class. I would recommend him for sure!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher really knowledgeable and really helped me when I asked.  He is also super entertaining and hilarious at times.  It really helped make this 4 hour class pretty enjoyable.  He is also not a very hard grader and I ended up with an A.  The workload wasn't really hard as well just a few papers and a group project.  Overall it was  great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2012<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Khalil is an extremely intelligent, worldly professor. He is really nice and more than willing to help if you send him your papers in advance. Interesting class, went on tangents sometimes, but other than that was a great experience for Intro to International Relations. Loves to talk about foreign policy and Israel & Palestine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: PSC224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AM. Foreign Policy is what I signed up for... he ended up using the class to talk about the israeli/palestinean crisis, which was interesting-but not what I signed up for. He's a good guy though. Tries hard to let you do your best, and if you meet with him or send your papers to him before class, he is more than willing to help. Nice guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2011<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great course and even better professor! The class was very interesting and I learned a ton. As someone already stated, the class can be intimidating if you don't have much prior knowledge of the region! Very informative class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2011<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, he's full of info and passion, but he's also easily distracted. The class conversation regularly got away from him. That said, I enjoyed this course and the readings Dr. Marrar assigned. I appreciate that he teaches not only so you learn the material, but so you consider how to use that information in application.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2011<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If there is one professor at DePaul that I truly love, it is Marrar. He is AMAZING! He's very passionate about what he teaches and the sweetest professor you will ever encounter. He makes class worth going to, never a dull moment. He is a must take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a wonderful Professor, very clear on what you need to do, helpful, explains things in accordance with the books rather than just his own opinion. THERE IS A LOT OF READINGS FOR THIS CLASS. I absolutely recommend taking a class from Dr. Khalil.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2011<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a phenomenal professor and extremely charismatic. Great banter in class. HOWEVER I would not recommend taking PSC 255 unless you already have a solid foundation in Middle East politics. The grading's not bad, but the discussions are extremely high-level (lots of experts in class). Often left class feeling like an absolute idiot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2011<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at depaul, cares for his students and passionate about teaching</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very intelligent, energetic, and funny professor that I learned a lot from.  Some of the material isn't exactly that interesting, but he makes it better.  Love him and love the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hilarious guy, quite knowledgeable.

Engages the class really well allows students to show their views on several conflicts and discussions are always interesting. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him if you are not a political science major like me.  I took a Soph seminar class with him & he really tried to make it interesting.  Kinda a hard grader, but as long as you show up & take good notes & at least put some effort into the assignments, you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2010<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's freaking amazing! His classes are socratic style, which is very cool. As a person, he is really chill and pretty funny. I took his Middle Eastern Politics class, awesome class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2010<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is amazing! It has been a while since I had my only class with him but I am still haunted by his lectures and wish I had taken more classes with him.  Absolutely fantastic and so intelligent and fun that you wish he was part of your family.  And what a heart.  With such rude professors out there, this one is even more of a gem.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2010<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes use of a lot of videos and is a pretty funny dude. Like other said, group presentation, 6 pg paper based on it, and a final paper about the texts. Energetic guy, runs around the room and talks a lot, but encourages a lot of discussion and, do i dare say it&#63; makes attending enjoyable.  Knows a lot about the subject and answers questions well</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2010<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT professor!  A must take!  Easygoing, funny, and a very fair grader.  Very personable and relates extremely well to the students.  Extremely knowledgeable of the materials.  Not much homework is issued.  1 group presentation and a paper based off of the presentation.  The final is an easy paper.  I took him for many courses.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A group presentation,a research paper regarding the presentation, and a final paper. He's a pretty easy grader as long as you do as asked. Attendance doesn't really matter, but I show'd up anyways. Of course you want to show up cause it counts part of your grade, but that's up to ya'll. Great guy. Pretty funny! Def. recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2009<br>Class Name: POLSC230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Professor, extremely helpful, increased my knowledge vastly in the subject area. I recommend any of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2009<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT professor and passionate about his subject. Group Presentation with individual paper plus a final. Tough but fair grader, but he is more than willing to look over a draft and responds to e-mails VERY promptly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Group presentation, research paper, and 3pg final paper are each 25% of grade. Attendance/participation is the other 25%. You have to read 2 novels for the class. His lectures are interesting, but overall this class kind of sucks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: PSC255<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Group presentation and 2 short papers; that's all. He's a pretty tough grader, and he takes attendance. If you put in some good work, there's no reason you can't get an A. If you turn in some BS, you're not gunna get the grade you want. He was real cool though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2009<br>Class Name: PSC214<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best teacher i have had at depaul..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2008<br>Class Name: PPS201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at DePaul.

Keeps class interesting by encouraging dialogue and covering great topics. Don't hesitate to ask him ANY questions. He's VERY open-minded. Easy going guy. He challenges you to think and if you do solid work, you can get an A. If you take the class seriously, you can't help but have great respect for him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2007<br>Class Name: PSC214<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, he is very intelligent and keeps students guessing at which side of the political spectrum he falls on, meaning: he represents both sides fairly.

I loved the class. He is so interesting and has a lot of knowledge on the subject. He expects a lot out of you, but is willing to help you get there. He genuinely appreciates students imput.

He is surprisingly conservative but, unlike the liberal professors, he respects everyones point of view so long as it follows a logical path (i.e., no Twin Tower conspiracy theories).  Your loss if you don't take his class!</div></div></div></body></html>
