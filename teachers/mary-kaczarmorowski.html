    Wow!  What a talker!  She won't let students get a word in edge-wise.  I would def. not recommend her class, it would make any student dread special education.  Waay too many hand-outs, no class interaction.  Waste of money.

    pros--easy, manageable workload, nice lady, lets you out 30-60 min. early every time.      cons---not very dynamic (feels more like an undergrad class), always seems rushed, hard to contact outside of class, gives WAY too many hand outs (wastes a lot of paper!!!)
