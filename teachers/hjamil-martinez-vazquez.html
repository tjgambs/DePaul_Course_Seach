Grade is determined by how well you can talk about your feelings about a topic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: REL290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good professor knowledgable on his subject. horrible personality! he can be a real a**! very short temper, tries to hard to be funny, very sarcastic and rude. Spends way to much time in his office. If you take his class watch out!!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's ok. The class is based on class discussions mostly. I don't know if this is for our advantage or his. I think he leads class this way (just on class discussions) because he is either too lazy to grade papers or because he is unprepared.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: REL291<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!  He is extremely good at his profession and vast knowledge on the topics that are discussed.  The readings are for the most part interesting.  He has a teaching style that is extremely effective.  The best class I've ever taken for sure.  This class is a must. You get a lot from it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2005<br>Class Name: REL291<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2005<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In this class you have to participate, so if u don't like to this is not the class to take.  He is very hard in grading critical anaylsis papers.  Only about 2 or 3 people got A's in both of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2004<br>Class Name: 291<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If your not a kiss ass don't take this course. In case the other post did not mention it, highest possible grade is A-, and that's if you kissed ass!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a cool guy. A lot of reading, if you don't read you can't participate in class and class participation is 30% of the grade. Be on time and don't miss any class, try to talk about something and you will be fine. For the presentation just make a funny interview and you will get 6 extra credits.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2004<br>Class Name: REL290<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very interesting professor. A lot of  my classmates enjoyed his teaching style. Makes class go by really fast. We also watched movies and expressed our opinions in the class. Make sure you take him! Also he is not boring at all!!!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
