He was funny and each class was interesting.  We literal only spent 50 min in every class. Get the book because you have to do the case briefs which are turned in after the final and are extra credit.  Midterm and final were easy (he tells you what will be on them) but get the study guide it helps. Would take again </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: BUSLAW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Starbuck is great! His stories will definitely keep you entertained and it teaches you exactly what you need to know. He is clear on what's going to be on the midterm and final. He also tells you to do the case studies as those are extra credit. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2014<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Staruck is the best! Lectures are super interesting and you always get out of class 30-45 minutes early. Final and Midterm each 50% of your grade. Take notes for the chapter before class and during his lectures. Both Final and Midterm were challenging but he curves. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2014<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Book is mandatory: he uses it for case briefings and problems. Class has never lasted for more than 1hr. He only goes over one chapter at a time. One midterm, one final. Practicing attorney so he has real life experience. His "language" is a bit outdated by nevertheless keeps class interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2014<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Staruck gets straight to the point with terms since some of the legal terms are hard to comprehend. He gives good examples of each term as well. The midterm and final are difficult since there are numerous chapters included. I would suggest buying the study guide. The exercises in the book help greatly!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes the material about as interesting as possible. You need to have the textbook for this course and the study guide helps for the exams. The exams are 50 T/F and 25 multiple choice. You must study extensively to do well on these exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best classes I've taken at DePaul. Great stories, to the point. Go to class, pay attention, take notes and will get an A. All I did to study for the midterm was read through my notes and I finished it in 20 minutes and was 1 point away from an A. Need the book to do case studies, which bum up your grade. Take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2014<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Staruck is the coolest guy. His lectures are hilarious and keep you interested. No HW, quizzes, or classwork. Just a midterm and final. I didn't buy the book and just studied for both using the study guide book and was perfectly fine. Easy A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy DOES NOT GIVE ANY homework, quizzes or anything. Lectures are written on the board. Don't use any technology so no posting of anything. ONLY GIVE OUT MID TERM & FINAL. I went to every class and still did bad. Don't take his class, his Midterm and Final is very confusing and you don't have an option to make it up. Fun class but not worth it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is one of the funniest professor i've ever had.

I got a C the first time I took it because it seemed as though his lectures were all you needed for an A. You MUST read the book AND take notes. Just reading it will not cause you to retain any of the information. You NEED to take notes. I got an A in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not easy at all, he ruined my 4.0 after 3 quarters.

Even if you know the material, his exams are hit or miss. They consist of true/false and multiple choice and most people got C's. Do not expect to get an A or a B. Seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2012<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He lectures, no attendance, at end of quater you turn in  the "briefs" for extra credit, i took the night class and on average we got out VERY early, even on exam days. He knows the book VERY well, cool stories, Exams: most  got a C cuz they used ONLY study guide True/False, Tip: ! ALSO you must read through the chapters to get a B or an A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2012<br>Class Name: BLW210<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is amazing, he knows what he is talking about. Class is very interesting. His tests are very hard. You will have to study a lot!

Always let out at least 1/2hr early. Buy the old edition of the book, only the page number is different. Study guide helps a lot. Midterm and final. Case study for extra credit. Takes a lot of note!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2012<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take Staruck if you can. He has a very dry sense of humor that is pretty good. He has tons of experience as an attorney so his lectures are relevant and interesting. You really have to be a slacker to not do well in this course, he tells you exactly how to be successful (it's not hard).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes law very interesting by applying real-life cases. Funny guy and very knowledgeable. I recommend getting the study guide seeing that his tests have questions simmer to the ones in the guide. Midterm and final are each worth 50% of your grade and gives you the option of doing study cases to give your grade a little boost if needed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2011<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was fun but the test were not what he said they will be... careful if you take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2011<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's actually kind of funny. if you just buy the review book the tests are very easy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2011<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Staruck is one of those professor that has been teaching the course for so long that he can teach it half asleep. Makes an entry level business law course fun and interesting. Midterm/Final + case study makes up your total grade. Attended every lecture without buying the book and got a B+. Take his 3-hour class, he always let out early.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2011<br>Class Name: BUS201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor!

Funny guy with countless personal stories and cases that are helpful. Very clear. Midterm and final a tad tricky, but only multiple choice and T/F q's. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2010<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best teachers in the LAND!

Attendance is not mandatory, the only time we had a full classroom was on the day of the midterm and final. He's a great storyteller, law can seem really boring, but out of all my classes this quarter, business law with staruck was the most exciting. grade consists on a midterm and final, really lenient grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a great prof! The exams were a bit tough, but if you study the details, you'll be fine. He does call out on you in class so make sure you're always prepared. The questions were based off facts from the book and from class notes.  It's still helpful to get the study guide since a FEW of the questions from the guide showed up on the exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Before you decide to take this class, consider this. Grading = Midterm 50% Final 50%. Study very very hard. Those tests are difficult. However, extra points for easy case studies due end of term. My recommendation, take him for BLW-201. Stay on top of everything (notes, reading, cases) especially for class time when he WILL call you out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yeah...I got a B on the midterm so I thought... easy.. I'll just study from the study guide for the final like he said to. I ended up getting a D in the class and now I have to retake the class in the summer. The questions weren't directly from the study guide, the final was really hard and I was pretty sure i knew everything. Not taking him again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a funny guy and attendance is not mandatory BUUTT dont be fooled by these posts his tests are HARD! I went along with what everyone said about the study guide and it is NOT true! 2 tests both 50% of your grade so do yourself a favor and dont listen to these ppl the tests are not directly from the study guide maybe a couple but thats IT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a wonderful teacher! his examples are very helpful and his lectures are awesome! buy the study guide!!!! if you memorize study guide, u will get at least a B in the class! i highly recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendance isn't mandatory but hes actually very interesting to listen to and the class is enjoyable to sit through. the book is ridiculously over priced at the book store so get the international edition (50 bucks vs. 120 something) also the study guide is KEY to passing the midterm and final. Case studies are extra credit on final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2008<br>Class Name: BSL201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There was no reason to ever go to class but i went just to listen to him.

Knows the subject and how to connect to to the students. Read the book, do the case briefs and pay attention in class, you'll get an A.

But this doesn't too much for the teaching part. If you take him, get the study guide to the book one way or the other. Otherwise plan on reading dry chapters and studying notes that don't have much to do with the test anyways.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: BLW201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When he says, &quot;Just study my class notes and you'll be fine...&quot;  Don't listen to him.  He uses the MC questions from the book, and teaches on his own, therefore, wording and information used in the book mixes you up, and you may not have studied it.  Be sure to read, or else forget it. Sucks when a professor lies about what is on the exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2005<br>Class Name: BLW125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This course was very difficult because we were graded on only 2 exams which were multiple choice/true false.
