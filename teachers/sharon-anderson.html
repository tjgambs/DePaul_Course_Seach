I really did not learn much, but I was expecting that because this is really a blowoff class (aside from the $300 you have to raise for 20% of your grade). Takes maybe 2-3 hours of work a week at most and is an easy A. She is genial, and laid back, which is a double-edged sword in an upper-level class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2013<br>Class Name: MKT377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Sharon is a very experienced sales professional. She attended Notre Dame and has a masters. She has an extensive work experience- and from what I gathered, she knows alot of people in many different industries.

But she did a good job. She gives out good instruction and lectures. The class is like no other classes you take before: 1 huge group project for the whole quarter which involves raising money! And a sales pitch and an easy final.</div></div></div></body></html>
