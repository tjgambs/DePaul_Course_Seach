The class is boring and not intellectually stimulating. When I asked for a grade explanation, she doged my emails and calls. Also has an annoying voice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: 104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Did not sign up for her on my own free will, and I quite frankly would question anyone who would, given the other easier WRD104 professors. Ridiculous amounts of busy assignments that ultimately have nothing to do with the mandatory 18 page final paper. Requirements and suggestions are vague, but as long as you attempt to follow them, easy grader. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is not hard, depends which WRD level you are taking. In order to do perfectly well, you must write strong essays that are clear and understanding. She won't grade hard, just the lectures are pretty long. Do whatever she assigns for the homework, such as the essays and the portfolio. Other than that, you will be fine in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Easy grader if you listen in lectures.

Papers on sports topics are banned. She is obsessed with current events and celebrities like Jennifer Lopez. Her lectures are pointless, boring, and she practically talks to herself. Reading is not necessary and she has not consistent grading pattern, not to tough. Hall has an odd obsession with the useless porfolio</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible experience. Grades you hard. Assigns useless and long assignments. Mandatory 25 page paper. Terrible terrible decision. And this is coming from an English guy.

The way she presented material didn't help me understand the lesson. The entire class agreed that the class was a waste of time. I learned more in WRD 102 over the summer course which was barely a month then I did in her quarter long class. Don't take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for WRD 103. She is a pretty easy grader. She looks for for content within papers, rather than grammar etc. All of her assignments are listed on D2L and she is fantastic at keeping up with grading. I wouldn't mind taking another class with her again, she's nothing spectacular.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>did not care for her very much. seemed more interested in talking about current events rather than the assignments. asks a lot out of students but doesnt give much detail. seemed like i wasnt going to do well in the class but wound up with an A, possibly an easy grader. would not recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Hall is awesome!! her feedback on all papers is very detailed and very helpful. grades very fairly. laughs a lot in class and makes class VERY chill. i strongly recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent prof.! Had to retake another writing class since the prof. I had previously for the course failed me. I def. learned a lot more by taking Professor Hall for this course and I am happy to say that so far I have an A in her class. She is an easy grader, but also tells you what you need to improve on which def. helped me with my writing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HER! I taught myself how to write a great research paper. She assigns irrelevant readings and a 25 page paper. She pushes her conservative Republican views down your throat. Avoid Star Hall!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: QED192<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, very understanding, not too strict with due dates. Chooses interesting topics to write about, somewhat political. Class is not hard, not strict on attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class revolves around essays, in class quizzes, and a presentation. Overall I found her class to be interesting and well taught (mostly youtube videos). The essays (4-6 pages each) were kinda of too much for an LSP class.... and they were due weekly. But i found Prof Hall to be very helpful with any questions. Shes a really nice and perky lady.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I completely disagree with post 11/14/07. She never belittled anyone in my class and she encouraged us to speak, no one just ever wanted to. I didn't learn much in her class either, but she was really nice and graded easily.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2008<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She lectures a lot, but laughs at her own jokes which i found amusing. You'll write papers but they are easy topics & not long. The tests are mainly vocab & are easy if you study. There is no final, just a paper. You are only allowed 6 abscences. I recommend this class it was very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>her class is not hard, it's completely a blowoff class.  The problem is, she is just not a good teacher and I learned nothing new.  The class was a total waste of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A sweet lady with a sharp head on her shoulders. Tends to speak down to students during her lectures, but it was 103, so I hardly blame her. Lots o reading, papers progressively more demanding. Prepare to WORK. Got an A on a paper I though was a B-, so she's fairly easy. Vocab's a piece of cake. Youtube played a central role in class, take her! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hall likes to hear herself speak. She does not allow her students to voice their opinions. She enjoys belittling students and making them feel like two year olds. She is not an extremely hard grader. Read all of her assignments; there are thematic quizzes based on the readings. She enjoys assigning long papers, focus on content.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2007<br>Class Name: WRC108<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hand in papers on time and you'll be set to go.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice, funny lady, decent amount of work, but just do the work and should get a good grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a hard class, but not a very good teacher. Didn't give students a chance to have discussions, because she liked to hear herself speak. Possible to get a good grade, just study the long list of vocab she constantly gives you, and do well on the 3-4 papers you have during the quarter. Alright if you get stuck with her, but I don't recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked this professor.  She tells you up front what all your assignments and papers are when they are due.  She gives 4 tests they entire term but they are so easy.  If you do the homework you will easily get an A. Oh yeah and theres no final!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice woman. Has a weird teaching style and is very into trying to impart her views on students. The class is kind of skimpy on work but what you do counts for a lot.</div></div></div></body></html>
