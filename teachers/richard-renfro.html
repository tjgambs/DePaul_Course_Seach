He is truly knowledgable but isn't one to brag nor make things complicated. He is a fair grader and tells you exactly what you need to get the grade you want. Dr. Renfro is also funny and makes all class sessions fun and interesting. TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: 101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, such a devoted professor to his students. Very knowledgeable and knows what he is talking about. Really easy to relate for those who are Latinos.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2014<br>Class Name: PSY213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good class, grade is dependent upon 1-page paper assignments with optional extra credit. Dr. Renfro hands out required readings, there is no textbook required.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2013<br>Class Name: PSY213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Renfro is really great and funny. The class was always interesting and open for different opinions. Easy class for sure. DO NOT come into this class without your ability to back up you opinions because he will sure give his.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2013<br>Class Name: PSYC213<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material is very interesting but the professor gets very hard to listen to. Homework is very easy, only single page papers due biweekly, exams are essay. Renfro definitely plays favorites with his students. In all of my interactions with him he has been rude and dismissive. An easy A but not likely to develop a relationship for a letter of rec.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2012<br>Class Name: PSY213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Renfro is awesome. Whether or not this class is easy doesn't change the fact that it opens eyes to an array of important issues relevant to college students and to Chicago.  This class was important for my development as a human being... I suggest it to anyone who needs a reality check, and an awesome, approachable and helpful professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2012<br>Class Name: PSY213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Renfro is really chill, laid-back , and funny. This class was really interesting and mind opening. I would definitely recommend this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2012<br>Class Name: PSY220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my first PSY class and I loved it! It was very basic but interesting. We learned a lot about statistics on Latinos and analyzed them. Homework was light but helpful. The assignments made me truly reflect about what I learned and I even learned a lot about myself and culture. I would definitely recommend this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2012<br>Class Name: PSY213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Without a doubt one of my ultimate favorite classes! Class material was very thought provoking, interesting, & kept me wanting to come back to class. Professor is always willing to help & allow students to maintain their beliefs but challenges them. Subject is taught with an open-mind & with a casual flare which I really enjoyed. Must take class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2012<br>Class Name: PSYC213<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very biased and will only teach you his view on things. It is an easy A but he is hard to listen to week after week because he is so annoying.  He is not professional in any way and i never got any graded papers back before the final so i never knew my grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: PSY220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this class if you need an easy class. No textbook, no homework other than 1pg reflection papers due every week. Piece of cake.</div></div></div></body></html>
