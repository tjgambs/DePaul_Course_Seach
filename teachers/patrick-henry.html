Easy going and presents topics very well. Loved that attendance didn't matter. I didn't go to class much since it wasn't required. I handed in the homework, studied from the power-points, and took the exams. When I would go, it was very easy to learn the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2007<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had the biggest crush on him throughout the course.  His classes are pretty interesting, so I suggest going even though he doesn't make it mandatory.  He doesn't go through everything in the book in his lectures, but he does go over most of it.  The guy is pretty much awesome, I totally suggest taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2006<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Henry is really, really great.

Witty, tons of energy, and very smart...not to mention HOT! Like everyone else says, it's not an easy &quot;A&quot;.

HOT! He is very thorough in his explainations and lectures. His lectures are a hoot! He incorporates games and discussions into his lectures (albeit corny, boring games). He is also not too proud to poke fun at himself during lectures. Only bad thing is he doesn't give you back quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2004<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! Don't take him if you don't want to work. Read your book and your notes and you will be fine. Awesome lecturer, brings tons of energy to class, and really funny.
