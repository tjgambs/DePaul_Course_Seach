I only say it's easy because it's practical.  Mrs. Pensinger makes it easy to connect the readings, discussion, and lecture to class projects and the classroom.  She creates a warm environment where  students help each other.  She facilitates very well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2012<br>Class Name: TL404<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved having Sara as a professor she is amazing and caring, She is everything I want to be as a teacher.
