Emmy, however, made it tolerable, if not actually enjoyable. She was professional while being sympathetic of mistakes, and most importantly I actually feel that I've become a much more proficient public speaker from her class. All in all, I would most definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2013<br>Class Name: BUSINESSCOM202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is pretty pointless.  Just public speaking.  Quizzes are easy if you read. Final is a joke. Gives a ton of bonus points. Its an easy A and gives you public speaking experience.  Required class for business majors so a good teacher to take to just get an A. You have to try to not get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2013<br>Class Name: BUS202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seems like a genuinely cool professor but her grading is so uptight. She advocates that no one is perfect yet grades very harshly on speeches and is very meticulous on the quizzes. DO NOT take this class. I am a good student and she made this class absurdly intolerable and not the least bit enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: BUSCOM<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly horrible class. The teacher does not explain things well waits until after we take quizzes to final discuss the chapter of what we were quizzed on. The workload should be the amount of two or three classes. She literally takes off points for the smallest things and is not helpful. Thought it would be a good class but DO NOT take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was very excited to take this class based on the course description. However, this was one of the worst classes I have taken. While I learned a lot and enjoyed getting speaking experience, the rest of the work seemed incredible irrelevant. The group project was so bizarre, and her grading is awful. She takes off points for the most minute details</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2012<br>Class Name: BUSCOMM<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor was very hard to work with. I felt that I cared more about the class than she did. She was easy, but it was too much of a hassle to communicate with her and know what she demanded from students. I would not take her again. She lacked professionalism.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2012<br>Class Name: COMM2<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very good teacher, take her she is awesome. very patient, intelligent, fun, cool, young, funny, i think shes great</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Emmy is a really nice teacher. She is really helpful. The thing I liked the most about her is she gets comments back to you RIGHT away. She is definitely quick to return your grades as well and wants you to succeed. Not a hard grader and understands no one is a great public speaker. I took it as an elective and did not regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the best class I have ever taken. Emmy is young, funny, and passionate about public speaking. Everyone in class was completely new to public speaking, because of this, we were supportive of each other. The entire class joked around and it was as if we had all been friends for years! TAKE THIS CLASS! You won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and really fun class. Attendance isn't technically mandatory but the speech exercises you do throughout the course are worth a lot of points and if you're not there you will lose them all. She goes over the readings in the textbooks and gets mad when no on knows the answers and threatens quizzes. Overall I enjoyed her and the course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Emmy is wonderful at teaching, and her class was my favorite class I've taken so far at DePaul.  Be aware that attendance is not mandatory, but your participation grade stems from being in class and doing the exercises.  Overall, it's a very good class and I recommend taking it with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: CMNS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take her she is great!  Public speaking is very fun with Emmy and she is really understanding.</div></div></div></body></html>
