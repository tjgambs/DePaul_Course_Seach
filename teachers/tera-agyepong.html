    Good class overall. Cool professor with a good sense of humor. Lots of reading but interesting topics and class discussions. My eyes have been opened to a lot of different topics I never thought about. There is a final paper and weekly reading responses. She takes attendance and expects participation.

    Two weekly reading response, 2 exams, a presentation and maybe a paper. One will most definitely work for the grade. This won't be a walk in the park. If you are looking for easy avoid her at all cost.

    Class requires a lot of work, readings every class along w/ responses. Participation does matter and she takes attendance every class so be mindful of that. She's a nice teacher, have to give a presentation in this class at some point. She likes to call on people who don't talk much so pay attention!

    Her lectures were straight from the book words for word.  Her powerpoints had barely any words on them and her quizes consisted of multiple choice questions where there were more than one right answer, but you had to choose the most correct one...I love history but this class made it hard for me to enjoy learning about it.
