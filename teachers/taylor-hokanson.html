    Taylor was great! He really knew his stuff-but most importantly, knew that an intro level class with no prereqs would have many different skill levels and worked with it. Gave lots of individual attention.  Very chill, read the book and discuss the concepts (although book not 100% needed), critique websites. Final = your own website.

    Unclear about he wants from you and was hard grader on weekly assignments. If you are looking for an easy art credit do not take this class.

    He gives you an assignment with guidelines and then grades poorly if you just follow the guidelines and don't do that something extra that nobody knows cause he doesn't explain his expectations well. He never responded to anyone's emails, classes were boring, and he picked favorites. He also doesn't change grades because he's never mistaken.

    Needs work on his method. Depending on what your looking for, he's more focused on editing through a quantitative lense and less of a technical lense. All the technical stuff he did gave came from the book. I would just buy the book and save yourself voiced opinions.

    Such a cutie pie, but class could be boring and confusing at times. Loves what he does, but since it's his first time teaching DC205 his structure and teaching method still had some kinks. Show up and do the work and you'll get an A

    Class has nothing to do with digital environments. You will spend 99 percent of the time building paper models. Attendance policy is the most unfair I have seen. You can be 1 minute late, giving him 99 percent of class time, and he will only give you 50 percent for the day.

    Highly recommended.  Tests were pretty easy, Photoshop was a little challenging but fun and he was really helpful and a funny guy.  I would take him again.

    What a funny guy!  The rest of the students in my class were so boring but he managed to always keep the class going.  The homeworks are actually fun and easy as long as you pay attention during lecture.  He's very easy to talk to and very knowledgable.  I would recomend him to anyone who needs to fulfill an A&L; requirement (we all do).

    Younger guy, makes him very easy to get along with and understand. Good sense of humor. Broad knowledge of Photoshop techiniques. Gives good lectures that lead you by the hand if you need it. If you don't need help with Photoshop, he posts his assignments online and only takes attendance on the day of the midterm and exam.

    He's a nice guy, and he knows his stuff, but he expects a lot out of students without explaining how to get there.
