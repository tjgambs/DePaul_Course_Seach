    Scott is pretty cool! hes super nice but he gives a lot of assignments. There's pretty much something due every class. This is a 2D animation class using adobe flash but if your not a good drawer then you dont have to worry about it. He grades you on the mechanics of your animation and not how artsy it looks.

    Scott is probably my favorite professor. He will converse with you like a regular person, and criticizes only with intent of doing better on projects. If you fulfill guidelines youll do well on the assignments. He teaches basically everything you need to know for 3D modeling. The class is largely review of assignments though so be ready to talk.

    Best teacher for anyone who lacks knowledge of 3D Modeling. The lessons start from a novice level and he helps you along the way. I still cant believe the progress I made in this course.

    Would HIGHLY recommend you take any and all classes taught by him. He will stimulate your desire to learn about whatever subject he's teaching. Had him for Motion Graphics, Animation History  and several other animation classes and absolutely loved all of them. I almost changed my major just because of him. I owe him my rekindled love of animation.

    Ive had him for 3 classes now and have enjoyed all of them. Dont expect him to grab your hand and guide you through software he is all about making you find your style and artistic voice. He may not grade like it but he expects goof work and lots of effort, which is what you should be doing if you care about your major. Take him

    Definitely not a teacher. I paid thousands of dollars for him to tell me to &quot;figure it out&quot; whenever I had a question. Even simple questions like website recommendations. I can safely say I did not learn a thing in his class that I did not learn from looking it up myself. His assignments were unclear. This class is more of a workshop.

    Very good professor... He's very helpful, and teaches you a lot about what you need to know. He's also very amusing and connects with students a lot better than other professors.

    I heard that Scott once drew an animation of himself kicking a bear in the teeth, after which he went and actually kicked a real bear in the teeth.

    Be careful what you say-- I heard that Scott caused the below two commenters' heads to explode just by THINKING about it.

    LMAO! The person below mine hit the nail right on the head with their comment. I have no clue how he is the head of the ANI department.  Thank God I'm not an Animation major.  I'm just everything would be extremely disorganized.

    The worst professor in DePaul CDM.  Doesn't know how to teach, doesn't know how to abide by deadlines, doesn't know much of n e thing.

    Scott is one of the best teachers EVER! His classes are somewhat difficult if you don't put in enough effort. The more you put into his class the more you will take out of it. Definitely take his class!! =D

    Coming from an antisocial engineering school, I wasn't used to enjoying and talking to teachers.  The class was a riot and a worthwhile start to my animation education.

    He's the only animation teacher so you have to take him.

    Scott is great, shows great animations during class, and has a great sense of humor. Dont think you can take this class without doing a lot of work. The hand drawn animations take a long time, but its still fun. Im taking him again for history of animation, take him if you can.

    Fairly new instructor (to DePaul). Nice guy, funny taste in film. Has odd opinions of what makes a great animation sometimes. Teaches well, uses Adobe After Effects. Good class. Avoid if you cannot draw well by hand, ie flipbooks and character drawings. Then again, if you can't, why are you taking animation classes&#63;
