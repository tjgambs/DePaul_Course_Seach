The lectures are not clear and they don't even seem related to the text.  This is a nice man and I am sure he was great once upon a time, but HE makes class hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2015<br>Class Name: ECO305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What I learned for the time I spent sitting through long lectures was not worth it. Get ready to read the text book. He's nice but not good at getting information across. Waste a lot of time talking about things that won't be tested instead of teaching the material. Truly disappointing. Also spends too much energy watching students like kids.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Willing t help but not always useful. Knowledgeable but you don't learn much just by going to lectures. Textbook and online  myeconlab homework are your only savior.

It's unfortunate because you can tell that he tries very hard. Whenever I went in for help he was always reviewing lectures and is very into teaching. However, even though he's exceptionally knowledgeable, he isn't the clearest teacher. Got a B+ with a lot of individual prep. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2014<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is pretty tough and it is a lot of self-learning. Prof. Berdell's lectures are always interesting if you like economics but only relying on them won't make you pass the exams. They prepare you for the exam essay portion of exams but for the other two sections you have to do the homework and know how to complete the problems. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring lectures.

Class is fairly easy. Boring lectures. Hw is online and you get unlimited tries to complete it so you can always get full credit. Midterm and final are taken directly from the hw except using different numbers. Exams are fairly easy if you review the hw.

Works very hard and is very into teaching. The type of professor you feel bad for because the students are so apathetic. He makes you write a really hard paper.

Don't come into this class expecting anything easy (final paper can be rough), but if you are willing to put forth the work and have a genuine interest in the subject then you will definitely be rewarded in taking this class. One of the best learning experiences at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2012<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely knowledgable but class is not necessary since all hw is online and tests are strictly from the hw.

I've taken him for multiple classes and always come out knowing more than before. He's very smart and makes sure that his students are learning. TAKE HIM!. Class was based on classical econ writings. Weekly reading assignments and a paper at the end. He's by far the coolest professor out there!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely intelligent and very friendly. The course consists of a midterm, final,homework,  and end-of-term paper.

This course is econometrics (statistics in economics). Only thing tough was the research paper (not something that you can bs and hold till the last week). Midterm/final are given (memorize 30 answers out of 350). Full credit on turning in homework. Lectures are reading-straight-off-powerpoints. Easy grader (in my mind).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2011<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is NOT a horrible teacher. He is difficult yes, but if you have trouble approach him and talk to him. I hate economics and the paper was absolutely dreadful...and i managed to get trhough it. He practically gives you the midterm and final, so just put in the time in those and you should be good. Homework is easy. He's really great guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2011<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher. Doesn't do any of the homework problems in class and instead wastes time talking about economic history instead of helping the class with what they need to succeed.  None of the test/paper dates are clear because his syllabus is a jumble of different articles and nothing useful. Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>overall an incredible professor, has a sincere desire to see students succeed. He took the time to memorize all 40 students in my class by the second week, and checks in with every one on an individual basis at least every other week. Extremely intelligent and will open you to the world of econ, but can be overwhelming amount of info at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Alright, let me give you the complete unbiased breakdown. There is a practice midterm and final given online similar to the online homework. What he does is print out the midterm and final that he gives you online. So if you do the practice midterm and final 10 times, you'll see every question on the midterm and final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't believe the bad reviews. I had never taken Econ before in my life, and yet I got an A. Hard work, participation, and determination is all it takes. Those who write the bad review are those who don't study and still expect to get an A. That is foolish. Enroll in his class if you are a serious student, if you are not one, then don't.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow...where to start, this guy sucks, goes way too fast and expect ridiculous amouts of tedious HW to be done by midnight Friday. This guy tries to be nice, but don't expect to learn much. Lecturer not a teacher...DONT TAKE THIS MAN AT ALL COST, despite all these positive reviews, you will regret it...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an interesting character. He will teach you a great deal of macroeconomics. Very approachable, responds quickly to emails. Gave the essay questions before the midterm and final. If you want to learn take him, if you want to slack off then don't. A-B doable if you do the online quizzes, attend class and do okay on the tests you will be okay.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did great in this class even though I had a slow start.  I met with Berdell a few times for the final econ paper, and read all the required chapters.  Macro IS more challenging than micro, but Dr. Berdell is very helpful and challenges his students--very appropriate for a commerce class.  A or B not impossible at all!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2009<br>Class Name: ECO340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor.  Incredibly smart and passes his knowledge on to students.  If you aren't interested in learning anything, than don't take him, but if you want to learn as much as you can from a class he is highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>reminds me a rainman - extremely smart but socially awkward. kind of a harda** with paying attention, don't let him catch you fall alseep, A student or not he'll call you out. kind of makes his students feel like idiots when the don't understand (which is likely). takes finals questions from online test and the essays are stats based easy to lookup</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my favorite professors at DePaul.

I've had him in both macro and history, and have been pleased each time.  He is extremely thorough with online lectures materials, notes, and syllabi.  I don't think he is punatively difficult, nor a breeze -- put in the work, and you will receive an A, it's that simple.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2006<br>Class Name: ECO306<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a lecturer, not a teacher.

Very knowledgable, though he tends to digress a lot during class - talks about a lot stuff not in the book (but not on the exam at the same time).
