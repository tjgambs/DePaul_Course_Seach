I received an A only because I completely worked my butt off. He clearly lays out what he expects from you which is nice, but at times repetitive and boring. Overall, great person, great knowledge, and absolutely knows what he is talking about. I learned a lot about CSD.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Stummvoll is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met. While, his class is pretty challenging, and there is A LOT of reading (500-1000pages per quarter), he is one of the best professors I have ever had. Learned so much in just 10 weeks. Don't take him if you're lazy. Definitely will take him again.</div></div></div></body></html>
