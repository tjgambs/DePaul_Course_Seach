    Ginny is always helpful and prepared and on top of it all, actually remembers who I am even though we only meet once a quarter. Appointments take only minutes because she totally knows her stuff.

    She is very helpful but it took a lont time to see her because some other student talked and talked. This isn't happy hour boyz. And all the boyz that keep saying she's hot make me laugh becasue i here she is with a prof who teaches LATE.

    I have been to a couple schools and Ginny is by far the best advisor I have had anywhere. She knows her stuff so appointments never take to long. She's funny, straightforward, and really easy to talk to. She's also really easy to look at.

    Ginny is an amazing advisor and saved the day by helping me graduate on time. She is not only committed to her job, but also to the students whom she helps. If they could clone Ginny, students nationwide would all graduate on time yearly.
