The instructor really didn't teach the class but brought in outside people who had expertise in special ed. to provide instruction.  I really wanted to know what HIS thoughts and perceptions were relative to special education and how we are suppose to teach these students. This wasn't covered in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2004<br>Class Name: LSI446<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is pretty boring, but, he's a relatively easy grader.  He lets you use the book for the quizzes and the paper (basically a book report) is a snap.  Only thing is, he NEVER lets the class out early.</div></div></div></body></html>
