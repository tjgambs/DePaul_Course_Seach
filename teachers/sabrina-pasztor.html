    She was more than a professor, there was a lot of work but it was manageable, she always sent motivating emails and was extremely clear on our assignments. I learned a lot from her would recommend her to anyone. She brings stress balls on speaking days and I think little things like that just shows how much she cares for her students, love her!

    This class was an amazing experience. I not only learned a lot, but i actually felt that  Prof. Pastor wanted every single student in the class to succeed. There is a lot to learn in this course and she does an amazing job at teaching the content! Absolutely would recommend her to anyone at DePaul!

    Really great professor. Truly has the communication aspect down by creating a very open environment. She knows each student very well by the end of the quarter.

    Prof. Pasztor is a great teacher. She is easy to talk to and made the classroom environment very comfortable. She is well prepared and easily reachable. Be prepared to work, a lot went into this class and a majority of the work was in the last 4 weeks of class when you are already swamped with finals :(

    Great class and teacher! She really makes an effort to be there for her students, is passionate about the subject, and clear about what is expected. Typical speech class with its speech requirements. However, she makes you comfortable with the class and students right off the bat with ice breakers and activities. I'd recommend her!

    You can tell that this professor really cares about her students. She gives great feedback and you learn a lot about public speaking/ presenting. I learned things that will help me after college. HOWEVER it isn't easy to get an A. Don't take it lightly. Buy book.

    I like this professor. I am very happy I took it with this professor because she is very understanding of your situations. I work and go to school full time and appreciated her ability to be a little more flexible on presentation days. Make eye contact with audience. That is her pet peeve.

    Nice teacher, crystal clear. Very glad to have a take home final but it's timed and online. I HATE public speaking and this has helped me astoundingly! I didn't like the peer Evals b/c my peers were a little mean at times quizzes were slightly ambiguous at times so I didn't do so hot even though I studied

    One of the most helpful classes I've taken at DePaul. Professor Pasztor did her best to make us feel comfortable in front of the class and also gave us really good constructive criticism. I really grew as a speaker over the last 10 weeks. Take her! You won't regret it!

    Professor Pasztor helped me overcome my fear of speaking in front of the class. The class was very welcoming and kind, which helped me feel comfortable in front of the class. I learned the importance of preparation and practice- two skills that I will take beyond the classroom. Thank you!

    I would definitely recommend taking this professors class. 4 quizzes and final is online (take home), but class is mainly focused around presentations. So it isn't boring and you don't memorize a ton of definitions. She makes it fun.

    Great professor that will give you more than enough chances to make an A. She gives out a ton extra credit assignments. I hope I get an A in her class because I enjoyed it so much. She teaches with meaning and leaves an impact on the class.

    This teacher is really good at teaching professional communication. I actually learned a lot about speaking, and I thought I was already pretty good. Your speeches get recorded. It is not a blow off class, but it is pretty easy if you stay on top of your work.

    Sabrina is very personable and helpful.  She knows her stuff and makes every effort to ensure you will too.  The pace of the course did get hectic towards the end, I think she could have assigned some of the extra assignments towards the beginning as opposed to cramming them in the last two weeks with finals.  Overall I would still recommend.

    Awesome class! She is an expert at her subject and very well at helping students improve. The quizzes are manageable, just do the readings ( which are not too long), the speeches are clearly outlined.  If you want a blow off, do nothing class, don't take, but if you want a teacher who KNOWS what theyre talking about, its a must take.

    Take her, worth your tuition dollars!  Not always said about classes at depaul.  What everyone wants to know:  3 Quizzes all multiple choice and one short answer.  Final was online.   Easy teacher.  Great constructive feedback.  Fun and energetic projects.  Grades are posted online!(super plus).  Speeches cover all topics and are fun! A+ teacher!

    Great professor with solid real world experience. The crux of the class comes down to speeches which can be very intimidating for some. Recognizing this, she incorporates good ice breakers to make everyone feel at ease. She is strict but as long as you show hard work she can be understanding.
