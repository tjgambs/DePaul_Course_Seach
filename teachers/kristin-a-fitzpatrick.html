Mrs. Fitzpatrick toes that line well and rewards disciplined students with good marks and help.  Her group work and peer reviewing tactics are not too arduous, and she makes the material approachable during her interactive lectures.  Not bad for a mandatory class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2011<br>Class Name: LL150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seemed distracted during the quarter, couldn't seem to remember deadlines, etc. If you are looking for helpful writing feedback, look elsewhere it. For a ten week course, things went slower by the fifth week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2008<br>Class Name: LLWRIT<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was just in a writing workshop that she facilitated.

I do not like this style of learning. Too much interacting with peers.</div></div></div></body></html>
