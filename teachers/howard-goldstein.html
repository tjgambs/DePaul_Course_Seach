I did REALLY REALLY bad on midterm and yet i still got a B+!!! and my friend got exact same thing and he got A-!!! In other words, dont worry about grade, and DONT BUY A BOOK!!!  Lectures boring (insurance, cant be exciting) but just go to class and do the SMALL amounts of work and get a GREAT grade!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although the lectures will put you to sleep, the professor is very nice and more than resonable. (He let me get away with stuff I would never condone). If you're late on a hw or didn't get the grade you want, just talk to him. Tests are a bit hard b/c his study guide is all the ppt presentations for that period. Nothing is too hard though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy, but SOOOO boring...It's worth it though..Easy grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2006<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Goldstein is not bad. Tests were written very confusing. A lot of double-negatives in his questions. There were two tests. The writting assignments were relatively easy as were the presentations. He is a very easy grader as long as you do the work. Attendance is key in this class. Lectures are boring so bring Sudoku. He loves his sweater vests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Agree, he is very boring. Nice though. Repetitive PPT's all class.Even though there may not be many ppt slides class dragged by him talking on one for over 30min. Tests are not that easy. Midterm & Essay scantron/essay based. Generous grader on special topic report assigments. Offers extra credit. I did not do well on exams and got an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2006<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the most boring class I have ever taken!

I really didn't think that I would be interested in learning nor did I think that I would learn anything. But by the end of the class you end up with an A and a good understanding for Insurance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy, easy, easy, you dont have to show up to class and still get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Real real cool guy. Has a love for insurance. Easy one page assignments every week. Midterm is multiple choice, no final test. Just a little group work for a final presentation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2005<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Real good guy. Weekly assignment and a group project. But thats about it. All group work in class. A real easy elective.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2004<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, Fall 2004 was the first time this guy was teaching in his life. The class is very unorganised and it seems like taking a philosophy class. You don't quite know what he will ask on his essay questions! YES There are essay questions for the exams.NOT A SINGLE FINANCIAL PROBLEM in the whole class.</div></div></div></body></html>
