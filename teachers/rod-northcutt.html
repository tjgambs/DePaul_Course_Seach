He's one of those people who seems to know everything about everything, and not only within the art world.  Art assignments felt regimented and restrictive, but he believes that this is what design is about. (In the beg. anyway).  He will cut you a little slack if you know how to ask for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2006<br>Class Name: 3DFOUNDATIONS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ROD IS THE****!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2006<br>Class Name: 2D105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class, very helpfull, critiques are boring..very easy..A+</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: ART113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome and a babe!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2005<br>Class Name: ART113<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2005<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher, knows how to get the students interested and uses all media to do so.
