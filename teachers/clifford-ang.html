    Not a bad guy.  Grade is based on a Midterm, Final, Group Project w/Presentation, two Problem Sets, and Participation.  Tests are tough but you will receive a better grade than your actual percentage.   He has good real world experience and is willing to help you out for the most part.  Study the slides before class and you will be fine.

    He seems like a nice person but does not teach well. I did not learn anything in his class. Take him if you are only looking to pass.

    He's a terrible professor, but he will not fail you. He doesn't care about the class and he is extremely boring. His grading scale is based on class ranking with about 15% getting As, 15% A-s, and the rest B+ through B-. He will not give you a grade lower than B- no matter how poorly you perform.
