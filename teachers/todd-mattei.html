Not the greatest teacher. Wish he managed his time better and organized more hands on activities during actual class time. I won't be taking a class from him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2012<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a wonderful professor who is clearly passionate about this subject.

I really enjoyed this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2012<br>Class Name: DC225<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Todd is a great guy, and if you show interest in the subject and talk to him about it on a more one on one level, you will learn a lot! He's really into the Chicago art and music scene and so you should definitely talk to him about that! He's shy, but passionate about his subject!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2011<br>Class Name: DC225<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was easy, but not much of a teacher. He did not communicate the lesson very well. I feel like I learned nothing in this class. So if you want the grade go right ahead, but if you actually want to learn something I would not recomend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! He really loves what he does and isn't afraid to show it. Very realistic about attendance/expectations. Extremely helpful. Definitely take him!</div></div></div></body></html>
