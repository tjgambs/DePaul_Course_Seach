I was not excited for this class whatsoever. The class material is difficult (I only took Chem 140 because of the honors program I am in). Dr. N was a godsend though. He does better one-on-one so if you are struggling, absolutely go see him. He really cares about the students. Wish he taught 142 and 144. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2014<br>Class Name: CHE130132<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Niedziela was a fantastic teacher, but his specialty is physical chemistry, so sometimes I had a tough time understanding what he was saying. If you asked for a one-on-one explanation, he was much better at "dumbing it down" and helping me understand. He's super funny in a nerdy way and I really enjoyed his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2014<br>Class Name: CHE130CHE132<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Without a doubt, Dr. Niedziela is one of the best professors I've had. The amount of interest he displayed in class combined with his teaching style kept me interested in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2014<br>Class Name: 132<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bad professor. Never used powerpoint. Doesn't know the material. Can't ask question or else he'll get mad. Cris ovies. Avoid this professor. DePaul has many other more qualified chem professors!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2014<br>Class Name: CHEM132<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher and keeps things light and interesting as far as chem goes, but you need to use the book a lot or you will fail.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2013<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He writes on the board so you can actually follow along and write down the notes with him instead of just flipping through Powerpoint slides. Sometimes he has students come up to the board to do problems. Even if you don't understand it, I suggest going up there because he helps you through it. TAKE HIM. THE BEST.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2013<br>Class Name: CHE133<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for lab. He is a GREAT prof. Take him if you can! He really cares about his students AND chemistry! One of the smartest and most knowledgeable professors I have ever met. Answers questions and e-mails very thoroughly. Would walk around and make sure experiments were running smoothly. Only bad thing is labs aren't returned quickly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: CHEM131<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really looks intimidating at first, but he really does care about his students and he loves his job! this class was really tough but he puts out time to help and he really cares about his students! if i had any chem teacher it would be him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2012<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Niedziela is great.

He is always willing to help you out; Takes a sincere interest in the success of his students. He knew every person's name in an 80 person lecture. Unlike gen bio profs, the gen chem profs tend to go the extra mile for students</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2010<br>Class Name: CHE112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. N is the BEST professor at depaul! I really enjoy how nerdy he is and how much he loves teaching! He is also very encouraging and always willing to help. He is  the reason I'm switching to a chemistry major. He makes the class fun and interesting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2010<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't have him for lecture but I had him for lab.

But he is extremely helpful - I worked really hard for the final and was in his office with questions multiple times a day.He is completely reasonable, lame yet entertaining sense of humor, super into chemistry, but one of the best teachers I have had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2009<br>Class Name: CHE211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for P-Chem II....

Tests were somewhat difficult. It was obvious he really didn't want to teach this class. Sometimes offered examples related to his field, often beyond the comprehension of his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's so nice!   its a ****, easy class (math using excel.... come on...)  but he makes it tolerable, i took an 8:30 class so i fell asleep alot.  you get to leave as soon as you finish your assignments so every day i left fifteen to thirty minutes early.  highly recommend.  super nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brilliant professor, but sometimes when you ask for calrification or for help, he tries to explain and it just goes over your head. He is almost too smart to be teaching a basic ISP class. Probably a great chemistry professor, no doubt, but I struggled to understand sometimes in my math class because he explains it in terms of science.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good enaugh to get a B</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2006<br>Class Name: CHE192211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Niedziela is great but if you are looking for an easy way out, he (nor chemistry) is not the way to go.He provides more than enough opportunities for you to succeed in his classes.He's available to help whenever you see him around and once you get past the initial initimidation caused by his brilliance, you'll see he's a genuinely caring, great man</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2006<br>Class Name: CHE192211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't listen to all the freshman/Bio majors. Chemistry is a hard subject and Niedziela is a challenge but in the end you are a harder worker and know a lot more due to him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2005<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RUN!!! Dont even bother, he is a waste of our tuition money. About 70% of the the class failed 1st qtr, and another 15% dropped cuz our grades were so low, and ended up retaking the class anyway. His tests are nothing like his lectures either, you think youre prepared but are in for a big surprise when you dont know question #1...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2005<br>Class Name: CHE1922101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Also took CHE301.  The best teacher in the department.  Makes the class challenging but definately prepares you.  He comes across as unapproachable but is always willing to help students.  I took him 4 times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: CHEM131<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The hardest class I have ever taken.He seems to get a kick out of watching students struggle to pass his class.He is brilliant at chem and expects you to be just the same.His lectures definitely did not prepare the class for any of the tests.70% of the class dropped the class after the 1st quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far one the the worst teachers I have ever had! Gets a kick out of failing 90% of the class. Very unclear, difficult and is has a huge ego. Even if you try to get help, he has an attitude that makes you feel like he doesnt really want you there. DO NOT TAKE HIM EVER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2005<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His part of the class was quite hard and the tests were just as hard. He always picked the hardest homework questions to put on the test and doesn't explain much.  If you do not have previous experience with chemistry, don't take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: CHEM131<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He did nothing to make the class easier. He was not clear and his tests were quite hard. He wasnt a helpful teacher. I learned nothing from what he explained. Dont take his class if you want a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: 131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he was horrible. he has a huge ****en ego and on top of that he expects you to be awesome at chem just as he is!dont take him unless you can teach yourself chem</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2005<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures were perfectly clear, but the tests were AWFUL! Only ten multiple choice questions and then the rest were short answer questions, which means there's lots of work to show! Be ready to dedicate lots of time to the class, esp. if you don't understand the concepts! Attendance taken daily!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2005<br>Class Name: PCHEM12<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful, always around to answer &#63;s.
