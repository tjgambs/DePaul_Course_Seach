She is very clear with what she expects of her students, and all of the exam questions come directly from lectures. She has a bit of an accent, but it's really not an issue at all, and there was never a time I couldn't understand her due to the accent. She also is really friendly and approachable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2013<br>Class Name: BIO134<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jingjing Kipp is an awesome professor! Super easy class. Our homework consists of coloring in a coloring book once a week, midterm, final, and a group presentation. I would highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2012<br>Class Name: BIO310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Kipp is a good teacher. She's super nice, willing to help you, and hands you the slides for her powerpoints before every class. She also gives you practice problems which are similar to the ones on the exams. Her accent really is not a problem. I recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2009<br>Class Name: BIO202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT take unless you have a Bio background.She curves well during the quarter but does not put those curves in the final grades.Kipp knows her stuff no doubt, she just does not know how to teach it.I have Bio background so I did alright, but not because of her teaching.Lectures and tests are in broken English.I STRONGLY advise against taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: PHSYS2222<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr kipp knows what shes talking about, buuut, she has trouble conveying that to the students, especially with the tests....I did well in the class because Ive taken many science classes and know how to study for the tests, but the majority of the class werent science applied. test avg's 60%..3 tests plus lab work..she does curve well though.</div></div></div></body></html>
