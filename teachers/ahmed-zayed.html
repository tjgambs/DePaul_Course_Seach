Lectures were completely clear; not a chalk-stroke wasted. His proofs were bulletproof (bad wording sorry)     If you are a math major, TAKE HIS CLASS!  Prepare to work hard and be amazed at how awesomely his mind works mathematically.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2014<br>Class Name: MAT100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst teacher, don`t take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2008<br>Class Name: MAT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Attendance wasn't strictly mandatory, but most classes had either homework due or a quiz. Both homework and quizzes were best five out of, I think, seven. There was also a presentation/paper. Lectures were pretty understandable and sometimes pretty cool, but a lot of review.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2007<br>Class Name: MATH301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not the most approachable professor and does get defensive when you ask questions BUT when you he gets use to it and is more responsive. I would recommend him because he does explain the material very well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2007<br>Class Name: MAT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very nice professor. If you are unsure of something, ask him about. Very easy quizes and exams if you've kept up with homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: MATH123<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hi is so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: MATH337<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He kicks ass!! One of the best math teachers for upper level courses. He makes sure you understand the material with weekly quizes and homework. Gives good examples, repeats concepts so you really grasp the material. Nice guy, willing to help outside of class. All around great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2006<br>Class Name: MAT336<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Clear explanations, motivating</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: MATH150<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay by far the worst Math teacher in the world. He is so unclear, and talking to the chalk is not condusive to learning. I am actually going to take MATH 150 again so I can learn something. Don't take this man...especially if you want to pass. The quizzes by the way suck!!!! Oh, drink lots of coffee - you are going to need it to stay awake.  :(</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2005<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He isnt THAT bad. Yes, his class REALLY drags. However, he is helpful. Just ask LOTS of questions during class. Also, you can go to his office before class as well. While i wouldnt recommend him, his class isnt that bad. Another thing, quiz once a week. The quizes are immpossible. HW is easy. You just need to hand in like two question.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ONE OF THE VERY WORST MATH TEACHERS EVER.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2005<br>Class Name: MATH150<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh my god!

He's very smart and a pretty clear lecturer, but he does tend to trivialize your questions.  More of a &quot;math major only&quot; kind of professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2004<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst instructor I ever had.  He is very unclear and needs to take an english class.  He is very rude and will not help students before or after class.  If you ask him for help, instead of trying to help you  will tell you to look in the book.</div></div></div></body></html>
