I approached him twice with questions, but he was absolutely useless. He spent no more then 5 mins reviewing the midterm and final, which had nothing to do with the essay question.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: PSC263<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>&quot;If you do the readings and study for the tests you will be fine&quot;&#63;&#63; again kids rating on here are ridiculous.

He's a 67 y/o man that lectures from his head, often rumbling indistinctly.  He writes chicken scratch on the board and his lectures have no organization.  It's supposed to be a 100 level but i was lost already</div></div></div></body></html>
