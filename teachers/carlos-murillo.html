    It's unfortunate that Carlos's ego prevents him from being a great teacher.  During last year's new play workshop at the athanaeum he routinely dissed the play to the actors and design team.  The man completely lacks even the most basic ability to interact without being awkward and he lacks any modicum of professionalism.

    Class was okay in the end. Grades harshly and critiques are scary. I'm not a theatre major, but I think that HE thinks we should all be.

    The class was challenging but really interesting.  You have to work for an ok grade but he makes the material interesting.  I would take him again.

    Horrible teacher.  Boring.  Unnecessarily difficult grader.  Not friendly.  Everything you don't want a teacher to be.  Take him at your own risk
