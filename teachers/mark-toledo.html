He's very knowledgable and doesn't have a &quot;chip on his shoulder&quot; like many professor's at DePaul.  80% of the questions from his exams come from the practice questions he gives and the other 20% come from the book.  I actually learned alot from his class.  He teaches some things from his real life experiences.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: FIN335<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy, curves a lot, but sort of confused. His answers do not match with quizzes and book.  Tests are from his quizzes, but he additonally gives questions that are not always logical, not to students.  Overall, he is very knowleable, nice and helpful.  Good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: FIN335<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TRICKY QUIZZES & TESTs...

Making appointment with him is similar to playing a lottery. Chances that you'll win are comparable with chances of him seeing you before class. overall - he is OK, but no more than OK.</div></div></div></body></html>
