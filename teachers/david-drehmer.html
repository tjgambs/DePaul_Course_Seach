It was one of those 5-week, 7 hour classes, but the time went by pretty quickly. You watch a lot of videos and there are no testsquizzes. You have one final portfolio to do that is pretty long, but I procrastinated and did it in one day (but it was still good!). No book, no final. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2014<br>Class Name: MGT589<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing Class, I didn't believe all the hype going into reading these posts but I was pleasantly surprised. easy class with mainly group work in class to reinforce the material. he shows good video clips and really genuinely cares about you learning the material.

It is all about learning in a fun , particle environment. It is very hard to get board in his class and not to stay focus.

If you have seen "Dead Poet's Society" he is as close to Robin Williams as any professor I have had. I took this course over the December Session and we only met four class. The only assignment was a portfolio that was really interesting and interactive. I would highly recommend Dr. Drehmer to anyone to take!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2013<br>Class Name: ICS392607<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>most amazing professor ever. worth your money and time.

He cares so much more that each student takes away something meaningful from his class than to load students with assignments/exams. Awesome professor. I'd take any course he teaches - don't go miss out on the opportunity to learn from him. He has great passionate, insight, and experience - worth every penny!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2012<br>Class Name: MGT529<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Drehmer is one of the best professors I've ever had. I've taken two of his classes and have experienced amazing things in both classes. The most SOCIAL classes I've ever taken! He conducts class in such a way that allows for open, honest, caring communication. Take ANY course   offered by Drehmer and you'll benefit in unexpected ways. AWESOME!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great personality, knowledge in every area you can think of.

Conservative students also might feel uncomfortable because he uses an approach to get the whole entire class involved. I think it would be better if he interacted with the class as adults and not make the class a circus. He did not dis respect anyone though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2009<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT Professor!

He's very though-provoking, engaging, and genuine. He's also the only professor I've ever had that made it a point to shake the hand of every student on the first day. Seriously, take his class - you absolutely will not be disappointed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Drehmer rocks!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2008<br>Class Name: GSB798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>David Drehmer is brilliant, and if you like to think, then he's a great prof. If you don't much get into thinking, he's not the guys for you. There were a few of the non-thinking variety in my class, and they didn't get much out of it. I don't really understand how someone can go through his class and not learn anything, but the world has all kinds</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2007<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class during the winter intercession.  He is an excellent professor.  His lessons are applicable to every day life.  Class is interesting and interactive.  Homework is relative to class lectures and fairly easy.

Took it over the winter intercession and dreaded going every time.  I have never taken a more worthless class at DePaul.

Method of instruction varies each class and he is always well-prepared. Cares about the students and the class-time experience and encourages participation.
