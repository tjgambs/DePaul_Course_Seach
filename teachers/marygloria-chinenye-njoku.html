Doesn't really teach us anything about drugs and you will get an A on everything you do. She has no control of the classroom and students disrespect her and each other. Going to class was like a little glimpse of hell. Did not enrich my knowledge of Alcoholism drug addiction and recovery ONE BIT.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2007<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty much a very confusing class, you never knew what was expected of you. class walked all over her and she had no idea how to control them.  She also seemed like she had no idea what was going on most of the time.  Not a good teacher for a drug and alcohol class, out of touch with Western drug and alcohol culture.  like a 5th grade DARE program</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok... really nice lady, but she definately should not be teaching an Alcoholism class. She lets the class walk all over her and is so vague on assignments and projects that I dont know whats going on half the time. Lots of videos are nice but I'm not paying $1500 for this class to watch movies Ive seen already.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's a bit hard to understand.. thick Nigerian accent. easy material and assignments.. if you took high school psych, this is a breeze. she doesn't seem to care about attendance but it may bite you in the ass at the end of the term.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2006<br>Class Name: PSY106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady...an ok teacher.  The class was really easy. One test, a paper and a few small assignments.  However it is hard to motivate yourself to go to class b/c she puts the lectures on blackboard.</div></div></div></body></html>
