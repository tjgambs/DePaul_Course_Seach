I really felt he taught the concepts well and made it easy enough. Easy tests (every problem you've already seen before) and pretty easy homework. I really enjoyed this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2015<br>Class Name: 260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't use the book at all. It's amazing for poor college students because you are getting everything you need out of the book without having to buy it. He creates his own homework assignments and tests. You are never surprised by what you see on exams because he tells you what will be on them. Show up, take notes.</div></div></div></body></html>
