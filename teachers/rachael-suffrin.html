Her love for others is apparent with the way she talks, teaches, and interacts with her students. Being the first class she's ever taught, I give her props for being so flexible. Although the program wasn't exactly what I thought it would be, I'm still glad I did it - learned a lot.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2015<br>Class Name: PSY310312<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Rachael is incredibly passionate about the course curriculum and it shows during class discussions. While the structure of the class was sometimes poor due to factors beyond her control, she was able to keep course material both relevant and very diverse.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2015<br>Class Name: PSY310312<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked rachael, but felt the program was poorly planned.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2015<br>Class Name: PSY310312<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Rachael is an amazing professor.

She really tries to connect with her students and makes sure you are doing well in the course. She prepared the class well to be mentors with the readings and lectures.  Pretty lenient when it comes to late work. She really wants everyone to participate in the lecture! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2015<br>Class Name: 310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a fantastic teacher! The readings are not long at all and are an enjoyable read. There are a  few reflections assigned, but not hard to complete at all and are only two pages double spaced. She's a super sweet person who grades easily and is willing to help you if needed. Take her!</div></div></div></body></html>
