He made the real analysis sequence managable. The homework was absolutely BRUTAL (he drops the lowest one), but the midterm, quizzes and final were way easier than the homework. Don't be afraid to go to office hours or talk to him. He is nice, hilarious and always willing to help you.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/23/2014<br>Class Name: MAT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ramsey is.. brilliant.  Majority of the class liked him. Crystal clear lectures. He's personable but has that Harvard-snide to him. Needs a little gratitude in that attitude. Not my cup of tea.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2014<br>Class Name: MAT215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors DePaul has to offer. Take him no matter what class he is teaching. Really intelligent and just and overall awesome guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2012<br>Class Name: MATH335<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great to listen to in class.  Willing to help. In class portion did not help on the homework at all. Would not recommend him if there are other teachers available.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2012<br>Class Name: MAT110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great professor. He may be a little scatter brained at times, but he makes class enjoyable. I love how he doesn't force students to participate in front of the whole class, but gives them an opportunity during small groups. He is very approachable and if you need help he is always there for you. I hate math, but enjoyed his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nick is an amazing professor who helped me to feel confident in my ability to engage with Mathematics and never made me feel incompetent, even though I haven't done math in 7 years. I worked hard and got an A. Take him, he is a nice guy. Also, he offers funny side stories etc. Ask him about beer brewing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2011<br>Class Name: MAT999<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Harvard PhD, kthx. Simply brilliant. Clarity of lectures is unbelievable. Take his classes if you enjoy learning things. One of the best professors I've ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2011<br>Class Name: MAT261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Clear lectures, readily available for questions. Two midterms 20% each, homework 30%, final 30%. Everything curved at the end. Make sure you bring sunscreen to uv-land!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2011<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had a bad feeling when this professor said that the averages on his tests were around 47% but I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the hardness of his class. In the end, the exams are difficult and more complicated than the homework and they also include a True/False section. Overall, AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher! His passion for the subject makes the class really enjoyable. He explains step by step ways to solve problems, as opposed to just teaching from the book. He gave 2 midterms, which were fine if you studied...so DO THE HOMEWORK (office hours help). As long as you attend class & take good notes, youll be fine. Take his classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2010<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nick is a great and fun guy - he made a class I dreaded not quite so awful as I had expected. The class is hard work but Dr. Nick was an understanding and comprehensive teacher that did a great job presenting the information clearly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very intelligent and very willing to help students learn.

Lots of note-taking. He is very willing to answer students' questions during the lecture at any time. Offers help on homework problems as well. Only real problem is that he has a corny sense of humor. :] Basically if you pay attention and take notes you're good to go.</div></div></div></body></html>
