    For a 100-level class, this guy expected WAY too much. He was totally arrogant and cocky. His exams were IMPOSSIBLE. It's all short answer/essay, you had to write out actual definitions for some of the terms, then answer essay questions that he was really hard and specific in grading.

    this professor is a wonderful man, highly intelligent, and i really enjoy his lectures. he is accommodating if you approach him.  i did okay. however, the lectures often went over the top of everyone's head.  only take the class if you are smart, seriously.

    He was okay but I think he wanted too much.  He should realize that it was a lower level course.  He also did not explain well what he wanted. His test were hard. I am use to getting A's out of classes he gave me a B-. Talk to him I think that helps you out in the end.

    AT first I saw this class as a challenge and begin to apply myself then after I got a's on exams and perfect attendance and he gave me a C in the class I just thought he was a jerk. What I learned in this class was not worth it.

    People who whine and complain about him are the kids who were freeriders in high school and never really had to do any work. He'll work you hard but in the end he does care about his students and he does his best to cater to different needs. Extremely intelligent, highly reccommended.

    At First I thought the class seemed ok, then I got to know the professor who is an annoying, indie rocker wannabe.  The class is incredibly boring, the test are hard, and the teacher thinks he is gods gift to the world; if that sounds good to you then take the class.

    He was a good professor don't get me wrong, and very intelligent; just that it was hard.  Philosophy seemed like 'a not that bad of a course' when I was going in to take it, but it made it harder than it really was for me.  It seemed that I would understand everything, but once I got the test...I do

    Definitely the hardest 100 lvl class Ive ever taken.Heck,the hardest class period. Tough tests, quite a bit of reading to do. HAVE to post on blackboard, otherwise no HW. The guy himself should be nicer/go easier on such a low lvl class.

    this class is so hard! way too hard for a 100 level class! the class is based on 4 tests and a final. there are no papers, but after you take the test, you'll wish for papers. the tests are all essay and all very complicated and require you to remember everything from the long chapter. so hard!

    BEWARE!! This class is EXTREMELY difficult! He is very arrogant and just talks the whole time, leaving no room for questions, and then he complains that no one asks questions. When people did ask questions, he intimidated them into saying/thinking that they don't know what they are talking about.

    He is really pompous, and is a really hard grader. There is a LOT of reading to do, and when you ask him a question, he'll say, &quot;It was in the reading.&quot; How about explanining it&#63; He also doesn't give you a good idea of what will be on the tests.

    Eh. .. . The topic itself is pretty complicated so props to him for being a good explainer-compared to other prof in this area.  But he also does not need to be so picky when grading. 2% for each absence-come on! Keeping up on the readings and paying attention in class are KEY!

    Was kinda worried the first day, but he surprised me.  The readings are interesting and he teaches the course with great breadth on the subject.  I'm not a business major, but this teacher makes the subject interesting and thought provoking.

    It is a very difficult course, and there is a lot of reading, but he really explains the material in class so reading isn't 100% necessary! Definitely advise everyone to take this class!
