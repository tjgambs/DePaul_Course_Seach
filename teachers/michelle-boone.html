You have weekly readigns and discussino board posts. She grades very difficult for the useless assignments she gives. Not a mean teacher, just an unfair one. Dont take her if you dont have to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2009<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is useless and a waste of money. you have weekly assignments which require reading 10+ pgs and responses to other people. 3 or 4 papers and a final project. She grades hard, not enthused at all, and kind of cold. shes not horrible but nothing close to good. you can easily get by with a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2008<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Should not be teaching... doesn not know how to.

I ended up getting a B even though I did everything. Despite what the person below says. Not very hard but need to put some time into it. if you have achieved alot like being president of a fraternity, working your way up to upper mgmt, make alot of money, then take her. If not, you will get a B+ at the most.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2006<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher...there are alot of assignments and blackboard postings...do all the postings and all your assignments and you are guranteed an A....she is very undrstanding as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2006<br>Class Name: ISP250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a hard grader compared to other professor.
