During class, he was very confusing many times and most people were wondering how he got an answer because he does not explain things well. Final was fairly hard. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2015<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very nice guy and willing to help. There are homeworks, quiz every week, a midterm and a final. I'm. It a math person. But this class is okay. You can use note during all exam</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an amazing professor.  If you put effort into his class you will definitely do well.   There are short quizzes each week, homework, a midterm, and a final. He is very willing to help his students.  I met with him several times outside of class and he was very helpful. I would definitely take him again! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: MTH137<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take his class. Most of time he talking to himself. quizzes 20%,midterm20% HW-30% and final-30% </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2015<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard to tell what is going to be on the quiz, his online homework doesn't aline up with the content on the quizzes. I didn't pass the class, the homework was time consuming and all, but didn't help with the actual learning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/26/2015<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn' really explain things, so if you're trying to actually learn, don't take this class. He writes and talks to the board almost all the time, so it's very difficult to pay attention. Excel assignments are a joke. Overall, B grade teacher, take him if you need the credit and can't take it anywhere else. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great statistics professor and humorous. I already took AP stats in high school so 137 wasn't so bad. From my perspective, Prof. Hayes is great at explaining material and taught me new ways to go about solving problems. He is very helpful and will make sure you're well prepared for the exams through the weekly quizzes and review packets.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy. Extremely understanding. Does not hesitate to assist students and understands when kids make a good effort and takes time to recognize and reward that effort. Did not regret having this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy. You'll never understand anything he's saying for the first 3/4 of the class. Pay attention in the last quarter and you'll be good. Assignments aren't too bad. Work with others and you'll be fine. Midterm and Final is similar to worksheets.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137506<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>This is by far the best math professor I've had at DePaul. I had him for my Business Statistis; which I had previously failed but he made it look easier. Go to class, do your homework, and you will be fine. Uses excell for some assignment, very easy. Take this guy, you won't regret it. The exams' problems are just like the hw assingments he gives.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult class to understand and easy to get behind in. Content was difficult, but it was a little boring, sometimes he was hard to understand, but always willing to go over problems. Excel assignments were lame, but easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2014<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hayes is the sweetest guy ever. He's the type of guy you email and he responds in 20 minutes with several paragraphs trying to help. MAT 137 is a difficult class for people who dont like math but Hayes will do whatever he can to help. Definitely take him if you're required one of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2013<br>Class Name: MATH137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Hayes is a really great guy. I came in to his office hours EVERY single time and he always answered my questions. He answers all emails and is extremely helpful. The worksheets and exactly like the midterm and final and you get a cheat sheet on both. Not very difficult to get an A. Make sure to study and ask questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Base on previous comments, he has definetely taken constructive criticism. He did not use a single powerpoint and made sure people could grasp concepts. Not a big fan of math, yet he makes it manageable. Pay attention and do the worksheets and the midterm and final should go very well. Extremely nice guy too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Didnt really need the book. Fairly easy class. Mostly lectures and examples on the board. Midterm and final not too hard. The excel assignments very easy. Not too difficult to get an a.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2012<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Imagine someone teaching a class without using the board or a power point. Almost impossible to teach a math class with just talking. Not a good teacher, not recommended at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2012<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hayes is a breeze of a class. Although you can get by if you are not strong mathematically already he isn't someone you should take. He teaches of power points from the book but doesn't explain or finish examples. He gets off topic quite a bit and while usually I am a fan of professors doing this Hayes does it and it hurts your in the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2011<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class is quite boring tbh. He runs thru powerpoint for every class, barely explains anything. If you have not taken stats before, dont take him. Optional homework but mandatory weekly assignments. Optional mandatory.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Hayes was very helpful and really wanted you to succeed in his class. He would do almost anything to help you if you needed it, including meeting with you one-on-one outside of class or extending the review session for as long as was needed. Hard material, but if you keep up with the homework youll be fine. Gives reviews for midterm/final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2011<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED this professor. He is extremely helpful and adapts his course around the class. He obviously spent a lot of time creating assignments for us that would be stimulating and help us grasp the topics. He tells you exactly what will be on the test and assignments. Definitely recommend him. Great professor.</div></div></div></body></html>
