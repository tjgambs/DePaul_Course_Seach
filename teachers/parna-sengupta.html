She is an excellent professor and demands VERY LITTLE of her students, readings are far from laborous, 5 quizzes, drops one. Two short papers, as in 2-3 pages. Straightforward midterm and final, not cumulative. Reading isn't required for class, but it is for success on the aforementioned assignmentsRecommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2006<br>Class Name: HST257<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good,helpful at all times,makes it clear, though high speed lecture.Before taking her class I thought it was going to be a boring history class but it totally change my perspective bc I could learn a lot, and easily.

Sometimes can go too fast in lecture throwing out lots of names and terms quickly, but will gladly back-track if needed. A fair amount of reading, quizes are easy if you do the reading. Learned a lot in this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: HST256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her! She makes India very intersting and you can understand it if you are not Indian. She so willing to help you in any way possible. Just study your notes and guides that she gives and you'll get a good grade. She very pretty just can pick out matching color schemes with her clothing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2006<br>Class Name: HISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great personality, very smart, always was well prepared.

She combines lecture and discussion in her class, and shows good documentary films sometimes as well.  She also is creative, as we have a &quot;Show and Tell&quot; component.  However, do beware of her lecturing: she goes incredibly fast!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: HST258<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class. She asks you to do a LOT of reading but doesn't really check up to make sure you did it. She requires some writing (in-class essays, midterm papers) but gives an option to write a final paper or take in-class essay final. Very nice, helpful, knowledgable, clear/organized, fair. This is her first year here, but I recommend her :)</div></div></div></body></html>
