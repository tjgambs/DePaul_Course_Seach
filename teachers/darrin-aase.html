Professor Aase is a major hottie and is an easy grader and like on the work but he is so not approachable. When i talked to him i felt he talked to me as if i was stupid and never real wily answered my questions. His class was good but i like connections with my teachers and he just was not the teacher for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you need to take research methods, take it with this teacher. I think he already has his PhD(&#63;), even though he's super young, so everything is fresh in his mind. Tests/hw are straightforward. He's always willing to make time for you if you're confused, but he's very clear in the first place. He makes a req. class pretty painless, & he's funny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2011<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good stuff!</div></div></div></body></html>
