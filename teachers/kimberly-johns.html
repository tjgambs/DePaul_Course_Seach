She was detail oriented in her grading, but was fair and really cared about helping students improve.  Highly recommend her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: MPS570<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible, made you feel bad if you didn't do something correctly.  She thought she was so smart because she graduated from the same MPS program. Worst class I have taken in the program.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She liked to talk a lot, and had endless readings on blackboard. She has numerous pointless papers, and though this is a class to &quot;explore chicago&quot; she was more like a writing teacher. She liked to act as if she was the smartest person alive. Not my favorite teacher.</div></div></div></body></html>
