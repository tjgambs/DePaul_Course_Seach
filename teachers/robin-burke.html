Homework assignments, that require multiple weeks to complete, aren't explained very well and few, if no,  worthwhile in-class exercises are done to help you figure it out.  Test questions are completely unrelated to classwork.  Solid foundation needed prior to taking this.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: CSC299<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He doesn't really give you any idea of what you're doing. He tells you to do complex operations and then doesn't even cue you into the syntax of it. Every assignment just leaves me trying random things until something works or I get too frustrated. Even when I succeed I don't know why. Haven't learned anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2014<br>Class Name: CSC299<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher. Our subject was Data Mining. Poorly organized class where quizzes were too long to finish in 15 mins/labs were done in class after his hour long lecture(leaving 20 min for labs;not enough time to understand the material)/projects are rushed. Teacher does not explain things well on top of that. Expects you to self-learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2013<br>Class Name: GAM376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took Game AI with him. He's very intellectual and so if you can follow him class and discussion is interesting. Basically it's a lecture and take careful notes class. Followed by projects and homework using those notes. Seems a little high level for something so technical. Doesn't take the time to apply the techniques we learn. Leaves it to HW :/</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2012<br>Class Name: GAM374<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Burke is someone that doesn't take responsibility for anything. If he doesn't have a grader for your work, he'll continue to assign more while complaining that nothing will be graded while he has no grader. He has you use ambiguous code that he doesn't explain and you can't google because it's from another teacher's engine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: GAM374<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a really nice, personable guy. Grading was very strict and hard. I took Game Programming One and it was one of the hardest classes I've taken. Uses some weird language on top of C++ which makes it really hard and time consuming to do assignments unless you're an ace at note taking. Learned a ton though and was a great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2011<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In class participation is worth as much as the final project, but even if you attend each class, its as if he expects you to be raising your hand and commenting on every thing he says. I haven't missed one class or been late and my participation is 20/70. If your grade goes down or you miss an assignment, he offers no chance to redo or make it up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2011<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. Burke grades ridiculously hard. There are no chances to submit or redo late assignments/quizzes, and quizzes are based on in class lectures to a degree that you would had to have listened to every single word he said. It doesn't matter if hes nice or if he &quot;tries to help you&quot; Heed this: IF YOU TAKE THIS CLASS, YOU WILL PROBABLY GET A BAD GRADE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good game teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2010<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was soooo easy! There is a lot of writing, but it is VERY easy writing. He is not a bad teacher, he kind of rushes things. If you like to play video games, take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2010<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decent class, a lot of writing but it was very easy writing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2010<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Decent teacher, a lot of papers in my class but easy overall.

I put tons of effort into the hw and papers and still only got a B.  I dont think he gives A's</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2008<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst teacher ever</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2007<br>Class Name: GAM206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst prof ever! crazy about having reading quizes everyday from packets that he hands out which are super long and boring, hard to pass the quizes even if you really did read, too many aissingments given out, lectures are so boring that most people fall asleep, this class is hard and not worth taking at all!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2006<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a ridiculous on papers.  I followed the outlines exactly and still had to do a rewrite.  Way too much work for a gaming class, this class requires more work than my other classes COMBINED.  Every week there is a paper or a project due, and he doesnt even remind the class!  Stay away from this guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes the class much harder than it's supposed to be! Lots of tedius work: reaction paper, analysis paper and three small projects..He grades unreasonably HARD on the analysis papers and requires rewrites. If you're lookin for an easy elective to fill THIS IS NOT THE ONE! Look elsewhere!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2006<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away from this class. This guys is so anal on every detail of homework and everything. Will not give A's unless you devote your life to the class....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expect lots of work and indepth analysis of games. This is not an easy class, but Burke is a helpful teacher and a nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2005<br>Class Name: GAM224<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly anal on papers, expects you to pull out every minute detail of the games you write papers about...TONS of work, an assignment every week +3, 5 pg papers, a large group project, and other smaller group assignments.  Don't be deceived by the name and stay away from this class/prof!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Long, boring lectures. Some labs. Fairly easy homework assignments if you pay attention in class. Few quizzes. No tests, midterms, or finals. Just a final project at the end of quarter. Ok class and professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2004<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are very boring, but he is a very nice, helpful, intelligent man. No tests for midterm or final- just a final project (the chance to redo all of your hwk assignments, for potentially full credit). Overall, I would recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2004<br>Class Name: ECT270<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was easy (even though I didnt do to well) but it is a lot of work, there is a fairly large project due every week.  The classes are also pretty boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2004<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a cool teacher. Sometimes classes can be a bit boring but he's sometimes funny. He sounds like John Ritter but looks like Ned Flander but he's a really nice teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2004<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well he is very helpful and friendly. He makes sure he answers everyone's questions. And another cool thing is that there is no midterm here or final. Just a portfolio that you have to turn in at the end of the quarter.</div></div></div></body></html>
