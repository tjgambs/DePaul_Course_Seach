She is always willing to help when needed and explains everything clearly. She makes learning Japanese not only easy, but fun as well.

Definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2012<br>Class Name: JPN201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really a sweet and great teacher.
