He explains to everyone in class--on the first day--that he teaches from a Judeo-Christian perspective, and refers to bible teachings.  The book relates to morality from a less religious, but moral perspective in terms of broad-based issues concerning Americans.  I saw nothing wrong with his appraoch to the subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2005<br>Class Name: AI188<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kevin teaches from a Communist/Christian Fundementalist platform.
