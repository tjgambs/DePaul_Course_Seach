Her GTA is very rude.  She tries to give everyone grammer lessons.  She post that her students are not effective writers and she wants say questions to be answered as if they were academic research papers.  She has a very big ego.  This class has been terrible.  Do not take her online.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2011<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's is so nice! She's really helpful and classes are fun! The activities we do in class really help you to understand the subject matter. There or no tests, only online quizzes that you do as you read the chapter or article assigned. There is also one final group project. She is highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher! Nice and young, working on her PhD I believe. Young enough to understand lecturing all day leaves the students learning nothing when the quarter is over. New and interesting hands on activity every class. This method made me actually learn and understand the concepts, I was amazed. Take her I urge you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2011<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor! Young, and energetic. Shes an actual archeologist! Great class (hands on) activities, and brief lectures re enforced what you read in the text. NO TESTS! Just online quizzes based on the readings and one final project!Her method of teaching is great! TAKE HER! You wont regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2010<br>Class Name: ANT103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, fun activities every class and you happen to learn arch along the way, very nice person.</div></div></div></body></html>
