She is so passionate and open-minded about every aspect of the course, as well as her students. I will rework my remaining schedule to take another class with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I went into this class thinking I knew a lot about gender but this mind-blowing class proved otherwise. I enjoyed this class but the material got heavy at times. There were a few major papers and I recommend meeting with the prof if you don't know what she expects from you--she's more than happy to guide you in the right direction. Good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Going into the quarter I was thinking that this class was going to be like my other LSP courses, an honest waste of time. But, this class was amazing. Just do the readings! Three papers, then a final paper. No midterm, don't meet for the final. She is great. VERY LIBERAL, conservatives beware. You can miss a class if you let her know ahead of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's nice professor. Pretty easy class. Annoyingly Liberal however. Don't take if you're Conservative.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2011<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an intelligent teacher that relates well to her class. JUST DO THE READINGS and you'll be fine. Midterm and Final were easy. She grades the papers hard, but as long as you support your ideas she'll be fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2011<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed her class. Took it in the summertime, so the reading wasn't totally overwhelming since I was not teaching at the time. At times, she would get up on a soapbox, but I thought that discussions were thought-provoking and intelligent. I would tell others to take her class, but in a time frame when you can devote time to reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2011<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's difficult for me to leave this review, because Dr. Webster is a kind and enthusiastic individual. But she is a poor professor. Her teaching is painfully basic; tests are badly written; her lectures are awkward, off-topic and mostly about her tangential personal beliefs. I support these beliefs, but class is not a forum for emotional advocacy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2011<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared...you will be expected to write as if you were publishing for your PhD.  She assigns 6+ readings a class session.  I think she honestly forgets that we are working professionals who care about teaching.  Instead she thinks we are learning to become published sociologists.  I would not take her class if I had the option.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy grading, readings are straight forward, but a bit much. Allows multiple absences IF you let her know ahead of time. Mid-term is 1/2 multiple choice 1/2 essay &#63;'s & final is 3 essay &#63;'s out of 5. Also an early final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Webster is super nice and is very intelligent. Her class about gender and society had a lot of interesting readings and clips but her lectures can get a little boring. She is a relatively easy grader and seems to really care about her students. I'd recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2010<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Since I'm the first reviewer from sociology 101, I highly recommend people NOT to take her. Her class lectures are straight off (word-for-word)the sociology textbook that she requires you to get. Her exams are quite hard but your essays better be written in the way she writes. She marked me down for writing the way I write and not how she writes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2010<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. A lot of reading required.  As good as it gets though.  Dr. W. is intelligent and willing to help.  Would take her classes again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kate Webster is a great professor!!! I would take her again! Interesting class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Webster was always understanding when you needed to miss class.  Just as long as you told her ahead of time she would excuse you.  She was really passionate about Gender and Society, and that was really refreshing.  Work load wasn't overwhelming.  She never considered anyones opinion but hers and shut you down immediately if she disagreed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really passionate, intelligent professor! Class is a decent amount of work but she is more than willing to help out students. I'd take her again.</div></div></div></body></html>
