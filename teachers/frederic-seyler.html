Also, he has an accent so he's really hard to understand. I literally dreaded going to his class, although it was really easy. Honestly, take this class with someone else. You will hate your life in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2012<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>100 level class with more work than my 300 level classes. Terribly boring. I literally would look back over my notes and see where I started to fall asleep.  I was excited to take philosophy and he defused my interest.  I dreaded going to class everyday.  The lectures were dull.  He asked for class participation but cut students off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2012<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Seyler is such a great guy. Super passionate for philosophy and although I'm not one to find it interesting, he made it so that it was. He is traditional in the sense of attendance and turning in your work but he does allow extra credit opportunities. Yes you will turn in over 20 papers total throughout the quarter, but they're super easy. Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2012<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If I had 1 hour to live, I'd spend it in this class because it feels like an eternity.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2012<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although the class does include alot of short 2 page papers, in all the class is fairly easy. He's a really nice guy and is always willing to help</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2012<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Though he does have a thick European accident, he was always understandable. He's a traditional professor in the sense that you should be on time and hand papers in when they are due. Don't be freaked when he says there's a paper due every class; they were 2-3 page summaries of what you read and he didn't grade them harshly. Very interesting class.</div></div></div></body></html>
