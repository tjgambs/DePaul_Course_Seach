    He's super intelligent, and pushes you to think it out. But he got repetitive so lectures got boring.  Helps with papers if you need it, which is great.  You can tell he loves Philosophy, but sometimes he seemed to want to be an English prof because he wanted us to become better writers not learn the material. Not bad overall, but not my favorite.

    Oh my God I love Prof Bleeden. He is so down to earth, so crystal clear on his lectures and assignments and so helpful both in and out of the classroom. He offers additional help with papers. He is patient and approachable. Lots of writing but his lectures are so thorough that you will know the material so well by the time you write your papers.

    David is simply brilliant. I learned so much from him. He is truly interested in helping you out and makes sure you come out of his class learning lots. He offers to help outside of class whenever you need it. He makes himself very approachable too. I learned so much from his insights. Highly recommended.

    I loved loved loved David. He is the perfect role model for high school and college kids. He's everything you'd ever want to be as an adult. He's cool, edgy and very well rounded. I didn't know what to expect about philosophy and I wound up loving it as a result of his teachings. He's hilarious too.

    David is coolness personified. He's edgy, sporty, brilliant, articulate and an engaging professor. He elaborates his topics clearly. He does not attempt to complicate the understanding of philosophy quite the contrary. He takes the time to explain and to make sure you get it. Highly recommended.

    This class was interesting,I expected to dread it but I really learned a lot. He pushes you to think for yourself. He is very smart and will go over something again in a different manner if you didn't understand it. He grades you on two papers:midterm and final.

    He's consistent and understands topics. Grades are based off of two papers, second builds off of the first. Allows the first midterm to be corrected in final, which can lead to another grade higher, for the midterm grade. He keeps the class moving, and tries to keep his personal opinions to himself.

    The only con is that he travels a lot to random places like Greenland and Jamaica and what not and therefore he will take forever to return papers and essays. Don't get behind on the reading or you'll kick yourself come finals/midterms. Overall helpful an kind.

    He is a great teacher, is very helpful but really challenging at the same time. He teaches the class on a much higher level than what it really is. The only problem is understanding the material, it takes a while to read and understand the material which will be most important on the final paper. If you want to really challenge yourself and how you think the take this class, if you don't then stay away.

    Took him for PHL 232.  He's a GREAT teacher!  He just wants you to comprehend the material.  Read and take excessive notes during lectures and your papers will be a breeze! He goes over all of the material you read typically sentence by sentence to help you understand the language. If I hadn't already fulfilled my PHL classes I would take him again

    Great teacher.  He really wants you to learn the stuff and the lectures are a basic outline of your papers.  You read and then he explains everything you read in class. Also a fair grader and very understanding.   Often gave extensions. Take Him!!!

    Awesome teacher, great guy, super intelligent. He is great at getting back to people from emails and he helps so much when writing papers. PHL 100 wasn't too interesting as a Sophomore in a class full of freshman but then again that material is dense and boring. He worked with what he had, made understanding it much easier with great charts
