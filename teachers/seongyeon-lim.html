If you actually care to learn finance and take the class seriously, then you will have no problem with the material. Her tests are fair given that you study and stay on track of the material. also, she is very knowledgeable about the subject. if you want to learn, take the class! ps accent is decent</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2010<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!

It was the first time the course was taught and the class consisted of a trading proposal,test in week 8, and participation. if you have an interest in the subject take the class. All the talk about her accent almost made me not take the class. it wasn't bad at all. very accessible great class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2010<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very hard to understand but the material is not that bad if you are willing to look at it outside of class.  Most of the exams are based from HW problems, review, and powerpoints so not so bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Heavy accent. Hard to understand her and not so clear on what she teaches.

Also, she has a huge attitude problem. I emailed her asking her for help and her response was useless. I guess u can take her, but beware, her exams are tricky. She'll always pull something on u. Just pay close attention & have a friend to study with!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Why is &quot;Hard&quot; aligned in survey w/ &quot;Useless&quot; and &quot;Incomprehensible&quot;&#63;  Grad school costs $$$ so Hard is good, otherwise time and money is wasted.  As pointed out in other ratings, Dr. Lim has an accent.  I did not find this distracting in the least.  She also knows the material cold and works hard to elevate your knowledge during the course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very hard to understand so just be ready to read the whole book.

The course requires a lot of work, but you will learn a lot at the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Did not like this class at all. She was very unclear when trying to explain the material. I had to learn everything on my own!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not sure why DePaul has decided to use a non-english speaking professor for a such an important course. That said, she does not know how to teach. She kinda has an attitude and enjoys playing the 'tough' professor role. Her exams are 'tricky' because she does not know how to write exam questions in english.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>How to get an A: Don't buy the book, just go to class and listen.  She gives about 5-7 homework questions each day.  Do them because she might call on you for the answer.  She likes to call on people she knows are frequently absent/don't do the HW. Finally, she gives review guides for each exam.  Know these and you'll do well and LEARN A LOT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She wants everyone to know their stuff.  She gives really thorough power point slides and she tries to integrate the class into the outside world by showing mini video clips.  Overall, she's a good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lim does her job really well as a professor. Her lectures are detailed and she tried really hard to explain everything thoroughly. Gives homework that is challenging but prepares you for the exams. Practice exams help. Grade is based on 3 exams which means you need to study. Avaliable for outside help. Overall, take her if you are willing to work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Some of her test questions are from the review sheets, but many are not.  So you need to do more than just studying the review sheets to pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/03/2007<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not as bad as people make her.

She is not bad at all</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2007<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not great, but she is not bad. A lot of people on this site are saying that the mid-term and final are EXACTLY from the study guides and h.w. I just took her over the spring and let me just say that is NOT TRUE. I think she has changed her teaching styles, only like 2 of the problems from the study guide were on the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2007<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE PROFESSOR IS AWESOME.. SHE'S GREAT.. BEST FIN. 311 TEACHER.. TRUST ME ON THAT.. MID-TERM AND FINAL WERE SIMILAR TO THE REVIEW SHE GAVE US 1 WEEK AHEAD OF TIME..

She will occ. throw a curveball.  H/W is harder than tests - but that's good b/c it prepares and isn't has highly weighted.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty good, people hate on her too much. If you take notes and look through the book, the class is easy. All the problems on the tests are ones she has gone over already in class. the tests are not bad at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2007<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i had Lim for 310 and I thought she did a great job explaining the material. i took her for 311 too, and i have to say i was disappointed. keep in mind that there's much more theory in 311 than in 310, and for some reason Lim is not that good at teaching &quot;concepts&quot;. midterm/final/attendance</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's not perdect BUT HOuston is the devil so take her for 311!!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2006<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice professor...not hard to get a C.

The class was not that hard.  She does have an accent but all you need to do is take good notes and go over the problems she assigns.  If you do that then u wont have any problem getting atleast a C in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2006<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not bad of teacher. Her test are over the review problems. She has a accent, so pay atten well. Also she is better than Houston!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2006<br>Class Name: FIN311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its a good class, not great.  Doesn't really explain why this is important.  Its just learn this formula and plug numbers in.  She does have an accent, but its understandable.  Reveiw problems are almost the same on the test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  Very clear, goes over the problems step by step.  The exams consist of the problems that were done in class, she just changes the numbers.  There is nothing wrong with her english, she just has an accent.  I cannot believe people would compain about her.  The class requires some work (surprise), so how you do is entirely up to you</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>only someone who's either out of their mind or downright dumb can give Lim 2 on easiness. her exam problems are the same as those we do in class (she just changes the numbers); how easy is that&#63; her english is fine, and she's always willing to help. i'm absolutely amazed that people complain so much about her...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think she's a good teacher. She knows her stuff and she takes you through step by step.  the book doesn't help much, nor do her slides so I suggest going to class. Her english is not as bad as what the ignorant, spoiled non-cultured people say. This is college, stop whining! email her, she'll help you 1-on-1 if you need it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, I did not do so well on the first test so, I dropped it. This class is just too much work and on top of that she wants you to think, hard. Take this class by itself and hybernate in a cave. She speaks english well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE DOES ALOT TO HELP STUDENTS.  Okay so she doesn't know english very well but thats really her own downfall if you email her with a question she'll help you just pay attention in class and stop blaming your bad grades on someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not as bad as people say she is. Even  though it is a little difficult to understand her at first, you adjust. Besides, the practice exams she gives are VERY similar to the actual tests. if you know how to work out the practice problems, you should be able to get an A on all three exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Before I started the quarter I was so scared about her class cuz of student's comments I got an A- in the class.  3 exams, hw, and attendance.  The hw helps boost ur grade. You don't really understand her at first but you get used to it, she puts all her notes blackboard and gives practice exams a week before the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: FIN300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't know DePaul offered finance classes in Japanese, had I known I would have chosen a different professor.

She knows it, but she can't explain it, and it has nothing to do with her accent. Because you can catch on to it. Book is not very helpful either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a real bad accent to hard to understand. But if you just need to get Finance 310 out of the way, and can apply yourself a little bit, you can easily pull off a B. She curves everything, so non-finance majors, its a guaranteed pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does try hard to help, but unfortunately that is not good enough.   FIN majors, I would suggest taking someone else because you REALLY won't take anything from this class- she is very hard to understand so learning concepts doesn't really work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She SPEAKS NO ENGLISH!!!FOB...Looks petrified when she teaches and has to curve the class by 20 points in order for students to pass...avoid this teacher!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She konw her stuff, but when you ask her to explain something she does not do a goo job. Her voice is really soft,n hardly hear her half the time in class. If you want to pass, you really have to understand the formula and concepts and do homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible!!

I ended up with an A because of the HUGE curve she had, but as said that shows how badly people did-- take someone else if you can and buy a fin. calc. it'll save your but!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2004<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think she is a really intellegent teacher but cannot really express.However like the ratings says i dont think she is that bad.

Can not understand what she is saying.  Worst Teacher (even though i'm getting an A).  You have to literally teach yourself.
