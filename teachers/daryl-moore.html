This course fulfilled a requirement but became much more to me. My writing/reading greatly improved as we dissected many academic works. His feedback was very constructive. He kept regular and flexible office hours, often working individually with students. TAKE HIM if you want to learn and grow.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: PHL381<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Moore is a brilliant Professor that really takes your breath away with the things that he teaches. If you ever have the chance to take a philosophy class, take him, because I have never met a more amazing man than him. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2014<br>Class Name: PHL231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Really interesting class! Mostly class discussions, so participate for easy points. Ask questions if you don't understand he really just wants you to grasp the concepts. Easy class if you go to class and read. Also enlightening on the racism and segregation that is still very much so prevalent today.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2013<br>Class Name: PHIL380FOUCAU<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has complicated language that leads away from topics, so its necessary to be part of any discussion possible. Because this course echoes gender studies, GLBTQ studies, and philosophy, its important not attend class. Moore isn't a tough grader but can be a grammar queen...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2013<br>Class Name: AESTHETICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the smartest people in the department and in any department. Always engaging, encourages discussion and critical thinking. Great feedback and willing to talk outside of class if you engage him. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2012<br>Class Name: PHL341<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG!! Everyone must take a class with Professor Moore,he is amazing! He is just so out of the box that you truly enjoy his class. He does tend to call people so do not think for a second that you can hide the fact that you did not do the readings, which are alot, but interesting. He literally opens up a whole new world for you. LOVED it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2010<br>Class Name: PHL383<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Moore is one of the most brilliant professors at DePaul. Considering he is a professor, at times his lectures can appear unorganized however they always come together in the end. Given the caliber of most students who attend DePaul University, it's no wonder everyone is trying to rip him a new one. GREAT INSTRUCTOR!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2010<br>Class Name: PHL380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Moore for Fanon and I'd recommend taking him. If you don't want the tortute of having to receive a grade have the class audited. The paper assignments were few. we did a lot of reading. Come to class on time. Do all the reading and be on your best behavior. He does single students out but don't let that break you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: PHL231<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not reccomend this teacher to anyone that did not have a very specific interest in the subject and who did not need much guidance, the classes were long and boring and his grading is terrible. He can also be very condescending.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor should be dismissed.  His professionalism is lacking and he thinks it's ok to single out students just because he doesn't like them.  Ridiculous.  He is part of the group of professors that don't deserve to teach.  He needs to get over himself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: PHL341<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy and can be entertaining in class, but his lectures are very unorganized and have no direction. When he grades the papers, he edits them and does not comment on content (much like ENG 103).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2005<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Moore is so smart that he is sexy. He isn't much to look at but once you listen to this man speak, you will fall in love. The class was pretty easy, there weren't many writing assignments and they were all easy. He require you to watch a lot of gay cinema but they are all good and he explains them well. You will learn  a lot with him. Easy A!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2005<br>Class Name: PHL206<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class was relatively difficult and extremely boring for a non-philosophy major.  There is not much required, only 4 papers, but it was not a very fun class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL246<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brilliant. Covers interesting materials including films. Lectures=fascinating. True, he can be condescending, but itll make you strive to become more intelligent. HOWEVER, he is an unfair grader & picks favorites. If you want to learn a lot, take him (and suck up). If you want an easy A, run.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>eh, he challenges you to think... his way.  His assignments are rather vague, tough paper grader, doesn't believe in &quot;Grade Inflation&quot; which pretty much means you dont get an A unless your socrates himself... I wouldn't encourage you to take him, but I wouldn't encourage you not to...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2005<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor, actually makes you think.  Although phil is not my particular thing...he made it pretty bearable.  Just read the assignments (not difficult) and come to class.  One of the best profs I've had so far.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL246<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He annoys his students and he is a jerk, who doesn't have a point. He has his select few and if you are not one of them, you will know it right away.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: PHL246<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The man does not know how to teach. If you ask him a question, he won't answer it. My papers were not graded, they were edited. No comment whatsover on their content. He is very intellignet, but he is full of himself, too. Gave out readings that bordered on ****. AVOID AVOID AVOID.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: PHY246<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/03/2004<br>Class Name: PHL296<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is a great teacher... may seem a bit intimidating at first but is very much willing to help students. email him outside of class and he is alot nicer, will help you on anything... get to know him and you will learn alot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he did intimidate students, but i thought he was pretty cute. i would take his classes again. im a guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

He will not let you turn in crap and he will pick on you if you have not read the assignments. Also he can be pretty damn intimidating but I guess I think stuff like that is funny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2003<br>Class Name: PHL231<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although he DOES seem to talk down to students that don't know as much, he can be very nice if you email him outside of class. He'll sometimes have pity on certain kids and give them easy grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2003<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Moore tends to play favorites and suffers occasional bouts of picking on students.  He is also kind of smug and while he can be nice, his moods are so subjective that I have to recommend that you stay away from his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2003<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is more like a talk show host than a teacher. he likes to provoke people to say interesting things, but he does not care about controling debate or sticking to the reading. On the up side, he is easy, since he doesn't care.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2002<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unfocused, unclear, plays mindgames</div></div></div></body></html>
