THERE WAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYTHING. SO MANY PIECES OF PAPER. It was like a new assignment every 15 minutes. She moved so quickly, so that's why it was easily graded but just a stream of confusion. Nothing was explained well, sort of a crap shoot. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2014<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I will provide the voice of dissension to the general opinion. Though helpful and a fair grader, I felt the amount of group discussion brought down the level of the class. Get into a bad group and there goes any chance of meaningful insight. Text-heavy PwrPt slides lead to long lectures from someone who is obviously intelligent and capable. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2014<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Dohrn has been one of the best teachers I've had at any level.  She keeps class discussions interesting and sets you up for success in her class.  She is very straight forward when it comes to assignments. If you follow directions and put in some effort you will receive an A.  High recommend her for MGT 500.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Dohrn's class was my first experience in grad school, and was a good way to ease back into classes. The Illiad and your assigned group are the best part of this class; if you make the best of them, you'll have a fantastic experience and great MBA colleagues going forward.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2013<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I describe Dohrn as harmless. If you're looking for an easy A, this is it, but if you're actually hoping to dig into management practices & theory or business ethics, prepare to be disappointed. She has zero business experience & her knowledge of & approach to the material are superficial. Not thought-provoking & not money well spent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2012<br>Class Name: MGT356<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a Sports Management class and if you are not much into sports and dont have much knowledge about it then you will have lot of hard time in this class because she assigns papers every week, Plus she is a hard grader, Attendance counts and will take off points for comming late to class. Not Recommended!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2012<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really great professor.  Is easy in the sense, that she tells you what she wants and if you do it you will get an A.  Simple as that.  At the same time I really did learn a lot in her class.  Really like how she makes you were in groups.  Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2011<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class, but she tries to keep it interesting by keeping students involved.  Reads off power point and her voice will put you to sleep.  If you go to every class and work witin your group, you'll get an A. No mid-term. She gives you a study guid of the finals material the wek before the test and it's pretty easy if you study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really easy teacher.  Just be sure to go to class and participate within your groups.  Never used the textbook.  Only a group final presentation and a final exam that was all material went over in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  Kept a somewhat dry topic very topical and interesting.  There is a healthy amount of class participation (discussion leaders, case examples) and a group presentation.  Guest speakers added a lot of value to the class.  Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2011<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very easy going and cool professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor was likeable, fun, funny, used lots of interesting video clips and excercises to get the point across. Felt a little like undergarduate, was hoping for something more challenging?but then again it was a nice easy A, good summer course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! This was  my first DePaul class, and I was very pleased with it. It didn't exactly challenge me, but I did learn a lot in the course. There was a lot of reading, but it's nothing too heavy. I would strongly recommend her for this course!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! She certainly keeps things engaging- the class normally went by very quickly. There is a lot of group work and reading, but it's all relatively easy. I really enjoyed the class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very fair.  Easy if you do your work.  Shows an interest in students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: MGMT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought this was a great class. Stephanie does a good job of breaking up the lecture and making it interesting. Paper, group work and final and extra credit opportunity. Really enjoyable class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2010<br>Class Name: MGMT500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is horrible. ALOT OF WORK!!! Do not take this professor, her assignments are very unclear. i took this class as hybrid (half online & half in class). Lots of group work. online assignments consist of 4 page papers. AVOID this professor at all costs. the class in general sucks. so glad that my concentration is not mgmt</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>real world examples a little out of place</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Minimal work, easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2009<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She keeps class interesting and uses a lot of active group work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2008<br>Class Name: MGT798<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sport Mgt: Stephanie is a great prof! There is no way you will end this class without learning. At times the lectures get dry, and she gets a bit flustered, but the guest speakers she lines up are AMAZING! She expects you to work for your grade, so don't take this as a blow off class or act disinterested because you WILL LOSE participation points.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2008<br>Class Name: MGMT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Dohrn is awesome.  She is very caring and wants you to learn the material.  She has a lot of hands on material that help you understand the concepts.  I would highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2008<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor. REALLY HELPFUL and good person to study with. I came from India and she was my first professor. Great to start studies with such professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2008<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is an easy A but it?s really tedious.  There?s a final, presentation, and assignments or self assessments that are like 3 pages long and only worth 10 points.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2008<br>Class Name: MGMT500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really makes class interesting and interactive.  There were many hands-on group activities that were really helpful to get us to understand and apply concepts.  There are a lot of work assignments to do outside of class, but they really taught me a lot about my strengths and weaknesses in the workplace.  Lots of journaling assignments as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2007<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class. Some in class group work. Some busy work, but not too difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2007<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really enjoyable. If you're anything like me, after a long day at work the last thing you want is to be lectured at for 3 hours. This class isn't that way at all. She makes it interesting and interactive. Every week there are activities and  in class group work (not graded). I'd take her again in a minute if she offered something I needed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2007<br>Class Name: MGT530<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class was highly interactive and we stopped doing lecture in lieu of group discussion and projects by class 3. Final was a group presentation.  Never bored, but could have used more concept work. Overall I liked her a lot.  She's not pretentious and really tried to make the coursework applicable to our jobs/lives.  Not tough.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2007<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She assigns way too much work. However, you learn a lot about yourself and the in-class exercises are extremely helpful in preparing you for the business world.  I think that I will be a better manager for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Teacher.  Doesn't try to overanalyze management.  Lots of groupwork.  An A is easily attainable if you put forth the effort.  Recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2007<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is teaching wonderful and good teacher.
