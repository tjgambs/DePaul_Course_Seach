He never learned anyone's name in the class, which is bizarre and degrading.  He never returned any of our e-mails, which is also incredibly irresponsible and impolite.  He just didn't seem to care at all about the individual students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2006<br>Class Name: LEAD801<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher....classes are always interesting and thought provoking</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2006<br>Class Name: CTH180<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very, very nice professor, knowledgeble, funny, and pretty easy, definatly take him any chance you get!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2005<br>Class Name: AS498<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fr. Dosen is such a wonderful teacher! In all the classes I've taken with him, I've never found him out of sync with reality. What makes a great teacher is not the manipulation of jaw-breaking words or being a &quot;task master.&quot; It is the ability of the teacher to ensure that learning has taken place that is the essence. Fr. Dosen is a great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: LSE250<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy grader, he took off a ton of assignments towards the end.
