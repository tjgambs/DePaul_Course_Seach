She seems to be more of a conceptual person ...who can help students see beyond the tips of their noses.  She seemed very sincere, authentic, and interested in student learning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: ISPISP<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher isn't too bad, but she really is motivated to teach what she's passionate about. She also has strong opinions, and sometimes disregards what students say, but otherwise, she is available for meetings and cares about her classes. Her classes are pretty boring, and sometimes, she gets too excited about what she's teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you ever see her name run the other direction! She likes to belittle her students when they ask perfectly good question that she just happens to know the answer to. And she says that the syllabus is key, but 2 weeks into the course she had already gone off it and made the entire class confused.</div></div></div></body></html>
