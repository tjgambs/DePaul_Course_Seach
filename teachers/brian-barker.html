Don't buy the book </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: HSP101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brian is a good professor overall. He's a nice guy and tries his best to really make sure you understand the material. Sometimes it was a little confusing and he wasn't completely clear for second half presenters of when things were due - but overall a really good professor and really passionate about what he's teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: HSP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As an adult student and who's taken a bunch of classes, this guy is average. Not a lot of work but when it comes to quizzes and tests, the way he words the questions are very confusing. He also sends out emails last minute for the class agenda. Like if there's a quiz, he let's you know last minute and this is on top of the confusing way he talks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2015<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brian is very nice, and very helpful. If you're interested in hospitality, he's a great start to the industry. His lectures are crystal clear, and he goes over everything you need to know for tests. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2014<br>Class Name: HSP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Brian is really funny and responsible! He is super easygoing and tried his best to make the class funny and meaningful! We had a few hotelrestaurant tours, and he help students to find internship within the field! Can't love him enough. The quiz are easy, but not the final, I thought I would have an easy A but the final really took me down.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: HSP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Brian Barker is one of the worst professors I've encountered here at DePaul.  Not only do I question his teaching skills, but also his intelligence.  If you plan on emailing him with questions, you will only get gibberish back. The class is an easy A, but it is not worth your time and energy to deal with such a professor.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great guy, has a ton of experience in the industry, and he really knows his stuff. He requires one group project, midterm, and final as well as three random pop quizzes based on the readings, so make sure to do them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2014<br>Class Name: HSP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Barker is all over the place. He makes up assignment as he goes, and changes the syllabus a lot. He skips his own slides and lectures to instead do made-up in class activities. The tests easy and the class is easy, but there is no structure to this class- expect to teach yourself everything. He's not much of an educator. Takes attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2014<br>Class Name: HSP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Very nice man, knowledgeable,  able to answer questions as they come up. Straight forward syllabus. He doesn't really give a true lecture. It's more like a review of what you were supposed to read. He posts the lectures online the night before, though, so you can read those instead of the book. Really liked him and his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING PROFESSOR. He is so passionate and his class is crazy easy. Definitely would recommend anyone to take him!!!!!!! He loves what he does and you can tell.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2014<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>This professor helped me realize that hospitality was what I wanted to do.  He's very experienced and wants to share that experience with his students.  As long as you read the chapters before class (he even says by reading the summaries you will be OK) you will do well on the quizzes.  Drops the lowest quiz.  Take this professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome prof! So nice and very straight forward. Quizzes are ok..1 group project. gives EC. Midterm & Final he gives the questions and gives u correct answers on your quizzes-which are used on your test as well. very easy! Interesting class. PPTs online</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2014<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Barker is very knowledgable and passionate about hospitality.  He is really nice and easy to talk to.  I had him his first quarter of teaching ever and he was awesome! Two small group projects, 3 pop quizzes so always read and he goes over topics prior to midterm and final. Take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2013<br>Class Name: HSP100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Easy grader. He says in class what will be on the midterm and final the class prior, so always attend that. It's very helpful. Overall not a bad class, just read the material and you'll ace the quizzes and midterm/final.</div></div></div></body></html>
