It's up to you if you want to learn something or just get an A. You will definitely learn about leadership. The prof. is truly an inspirational person. He will let you work on assignments at your own pace. Guest speaker is also very interesting. I would take any class with this prof. again and highly reccomend it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2015<br>Class Name: IS500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very relevant.  There wasn't a class I went to that I didn't enjoy, and I learned many lessons about the real world and how to become a better leader.  Would absolutely take any other class he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2015<br>Class Name: IS500<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is no focus to his lectures. He just rambles. He is not sharp enough or  have enough of a business acumen to teach the case study method using Harvard Business School cases. He tries to make you into a management consultant but he isn't qualified himself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2014<br>Class Name: IS511901<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, you get what you put in.

It did not add to my career development in the class. This professor is not professional, take the class if you want an easy A, but if you want to actually learn something in the IT fields, I suggest that you don't even waste your money investing listening to useless teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: IS511<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He lets the student teaches the class, while he states some points or tells a story about it that are interesting. Overall, easy 'A' but your learn nothing in the class but will learn interesting facts from Prof. Fisher.</div></div></div></body></html>
