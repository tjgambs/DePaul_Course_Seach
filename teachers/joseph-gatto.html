But welcome to grad school required classes.  That's part of the point of going to grad school, taking advantage of the experiences of other professionals around you.  Overall, a very fair teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2011<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quizzes are done online outside of class time, and they are HARD.  You have 10 minutes to complete 12 questions.  Get an e-book!  You are graded on participation during every class and it is worth 35% of your grade, so speak up!  He is a nice guy, and makes the discussions interesting, even if you have no interest in IT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2011<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If at all possible, I would advise you NOT to take this class with Gatto. If you do, expect a lot of busy work, long class periods, and forced participation. Though the classes were not too boring, they did little to reinforce anything that you learn in the book (which is useless by the way). He also always keeps you the entire time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2011<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I personally hated this class. The class sessions were absolutely useless.  I did not learn a single thing the entire semester.  The professor grades you every class on participation so people are forced to say dumb things in order to get a decent grade in the class. I would NEVER take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was a joke.  Gatto is purportedly an IT wiz but shared zero knowledge the entire term.  There was no need for any professor at all the way the class is structured so not entire Gatto's fault.  Be prepared for dumb reading and horribly boring class sessions where you will say stupid things to get your participation points.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Let's get one thing straight...this class is a grind. But it is not Gatto's fault, from what I hear all syllabus' are the same for MIS555.  Gatto I think manages it well and is very fair.  His classes are very well organized and directs conversation well.  Fair grader.  But be prepared for a ton of reading and yes people talking for the hell of it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2008<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class.  It was not too easy, but very helpful.  The prof. makes learnign fun and spurs conversation and debate.  NO TESTS!  although no tests, a ton of work to prepare for each week including 10 minute timed quizzes.  Highly Recommmended (I got an A)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>35% of your grade from participation is NOT a good thing.  The classroom is a football field with students fighting to get called on.  Prof. Gatto does no teaching--you learn from the book and the repetitive chatty people.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While I received an A, I don't like his grading method.  It's extremely subjective.  Thirty five percent of your grade comes from class participation.  This encourages people to talk just for the sake of talking.  I did not like the class discussions because they were pointless.  Prof. Gatto relies too much on the students to teach each other.  He</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a lot of busy work. heavly in participation. weekly quizzes. If you take this class, it would keep you busy. Reading the textbook is helpful. Talk as much as you can in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes self absorbed and egotistical. The class is required which is the only reason I took it.  The format is the same no matter who you take it with. It was the worst class I have taken at DePaul. I learned nothing from him. The class consisted of people just talking to get participation points. He barely divulges anything about his knowledge of IT.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of busy work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2007<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is a lot of work in terms of reading.  Quizzes are based on the book and participation is 35% of your grade.  Do the reading early and know the fine details.  Joe is a former CIO, encourages active participation, and expects nothing but professional graduate work.  He's a good prof if you are interested in IT management.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2006<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class.  Lots of reading.  If you participate, you will do very well in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2006<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he was a good teacher and I do not have a background in MIS. Some of the material was difficult to understand but I just asked questions and he explained the material. Grade is dependent on participation, so ask questions. There is a lot of reading and quizes but no mid-term or final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with everything everyone else has said about him.  Students would learn a lot more if he would share some of his knowledge, but he is very reluctant to do that.  All in all, you will probably enjoy him if you have some interest in the field and enjoy shooting the breeze talking about IT related topics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of work, but you learn a lot. Participation-worth 35% of grade-is tracked every week.If you do not have an IT career you will be challenged because you will not be able to contribute as much to the class discussions because you are learning-so your grade may suffer. If you take this class, make sure class size is small so you can participate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2005<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like the class...BUT I highly suggest taking a different prof.  This is the most ineffecient use of time I have ever spent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2005<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do NOT take him!  He thinks everyone is supposed to know everything about MIS and he actually sits in class marking quality and quantity of participation.  The book is mind-numbingly boring and so's the professor and his methods.  This is a req for MBA but take it with someone else.  Non-IT people will have a difficult time in his class.</div></div></div></body></html>
