You can never understand the man. He doesn't care when no one understands the material, he keeps moving forward even when people have questions. The textbook in the syllabus was "the wrong textbook" according to him. Also, his tests are ridiculously hard. He goes off on tangents that have nothing to do with the class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2014<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Do not be intimidated by his accent. He repeats the important things. READ the book it helps understand him when he lectures. Quizzes can be found online.Midterm easy. I slacked on the final and did less reading hence the B+. Easy class if you do the reading and study power point slides. The homework also helps prep for Test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2014<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He comes into class unprepared, and late on a regular basis. Easily gets off track and doesn't explain anything complicated thoroughly. He just runs through power point presentations, and doesn't stop to go through examples of anything. All of his homework can be found online from other universities and he clearly isn't motivated to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2014<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very confusing lectures with no clear path on where it is going. Jumping from multiple points without even checking if everyone is on board. If you try to challenge his opinion in class he will be defensive and will try to ignore you. Don't take it with lee find a different professor to learn economics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2014<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is dry as they can get. He makes this class confusing and boring. He will keep talking to him self over and over again without even looking at us. I am sure he knows economics but this guy can't teach and I would say try to avoid him if possible (GSB 420 and ECON 509)and good luck getting a valid respond from him via email or in person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2013<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is interesting. Professor is passionate about the subject, funny and nice person. It is assigned quite a lot of homework and online quizzes, but it really helps to understand the material.  Two short open book exams are easy. Midterm and final exams are more difficult, but generous curve was applied. I would take him again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2013<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard to understand his accent, but he's a nice guy who will help you to understand. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2013<br>Class Name: ECO31203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was very funny and tried to stimulate interest at all times.  You can use any version of the textbook, so you can find an older version at a very cheap price.  He  wants you to succeed and learn.  If you try, there is no reason not to get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2012<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lee is a great teacher and is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. Take the Macroeconomics class with him if you are serious about learning and are willing to put in some effort. He makes you apply the theory by using real world business events and is very articulate in his lectures. I learnt a lot from this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2012<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lee is one of the only teachers who actaully teach GSB 420. His use of the computer lab makes the class so much more interesting. Forget the boook as its totally worthless. Hes a funny guy and loves Stats/Calculus. But aside from him being a good professor, this class is brutal and stay on top of everything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2012<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great teacher as long as you do the work and pay attention in class. Yes, his english is not perfect but if you just follow along with the book you'll do ok. Lots of extra credit opportunities. He was also very funny and absolutely loves calculus and statistics. I would take his class again for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2011<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice guy, but forget trying to pay attention in class.  His English is alright, but the good news is that if you follow the book, and do the assignments you will get an A.  If you just study you will be fine.  The best part about Prof. Jin Man Lee is that he is a very easy grader! Make friends early for Study Groups: THEY HELP!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2011<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mid-term was fairly easy but Final was really tough.  He's a pretty easy grader though.  Taught myself mostly from the book, but enjoyed listening to him in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is passionate, enthusiastic, and very friendly. To top it off, he really is an excellent teacher as long as you attend every class. One of the best DePaul has to offer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor really enjoys math and it's clear he's passionate about the subject. However, his method of teaching is based on beating the material into you by massive amounts of homework. His tests are extremely lengthy and is more about time management than anything else. I learned a lot but I feel I could have learned more in a better way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mixed feelings about this class. I rarely understood what was going on in the lectures, however, he teaches directly from the book.  If you are able to teach yourself from the book you will do okay. The last couple of chapters are hard though and you may need outside help to really understand it. I've heard he is easier than other sections however.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2010<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can tell professor Lee truely loves statistics.  I took this class during the 5 week summer session.  He assigns a lot of homework, but it's necessary to do well on the tests.  Tests are open book.  He is a fair grader and gives you points for showing your work.  Don't be afraid to ask questions, otherwise he'll move forward and you'll be lost.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2010<br>Class Name: ECO315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Does not speak english. Very difficult to understand. Just hated this class. I literally never understood him. Doesn't teach anything that is on the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned a lot from this class. He is very patient and helpful. I wish I had him earlier when I was in college.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Lee is very personable, and truly enjoys Stats.  He gives two exams and weekly homework.  His exams are like marathons, but he's a very fair grader (points for your effort).  The homework is from the textbook, post your answers on blackboard.  Textbook was a pain to read through, but needed for the exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I haven't seen any professor like him. He is one of my best ones who made me understand calculus/stat/regression even though it was my first calculus/regression class. I highly recommend him if you don't have much background in math.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jin Man is awesome - really nice guy who's not looking to screw you but is very tough.  Its certainly not an easy A but you'll learn a lot.  Came out way ahead of students from other GSB 420 classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Lee is a very knowledgable person but having a heavy accent doesn't help much especially for such a technical class. Be prepared to work hard and self study quite a bit. He does curve exams which helps.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very passionate and kind professor.  He is a bit hard to understand at times.  Midterm and Final is 70% of grade and they are heavily curved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, enthusiastic about the topics he teaches. The book his uses is horrendous, though. Written by another DePaul prof, it is light on subject matter and heavy on muddled grammar. I felt sorry for people in the class without a solid math background.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very personable and friendly professor.  He really wants you to learn and is willing to help if he can.  I advise not to take this class if you need your hand held and you need very specific directions. You almost have to teach yourself off of the book moreso than the lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very enthusiastic about the business analytics and statistics, which is great for this topic.  Unfortunately, he does this thing which I've grown to hate about professors...testing you on things he does not properly teach.  So if you are following the class properly and doing well on the homework, don't expect to do well on his tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this in summer and almost killed myself doing it.  I had never taken Calc or Stats and Lee assumes that everyone has some background.  He goes over the material and explains it pretty well although he accent is a little tough at times. Tons of homework questions but the exams are open book and fair. Be prepared to work HARD with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very funny and nice guy, which balances the fact he flies through the lectures. If you have no prior knowledge of Calculus, etc; he could be tough. He curved the exams, which made them fair. Don't expect much help from him outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely fair and well-organized.  I took this class as a 5-week summer course and it was tough, but the prof was very reasonable when designing the exams and such.  He is funny and mixes his humor into the lectures.  Highly recommended for this killer course!</div></div></div></body></html>
