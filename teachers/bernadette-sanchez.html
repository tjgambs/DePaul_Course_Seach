Not much quality learning, just discussion based on undergrad's opinions.  She's not very helpful.  One plus is that you won't have to study for any big tests (just weekly quizzes), but there is a 25 page paper due at the end of the quarter</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2007<br>Class Name: PSY220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Made the class very fun and interesting.  Quizzes were relatively simple along with the midterm and final.  Class discussions were entertaining.  My only complaint is with her final project, it was very vague and difficult to execute when you have a full quarter of classes.  Everyone in class seemed to be having issues with the final project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and really sweet.

I didn't find it too difficult but rather more interesting than previous psychology classes. Very clear on what she wants and tests for. I would take her again.

Know that she's a community psychologist and most of the topics will be geared towards that subject (not my interest, but she still teaches well). The things that aren't related to com. psych, her stats are a bit off.
