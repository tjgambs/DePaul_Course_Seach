Her final is a killer, she basically tests you on the entire book which is 15-17 chapters, if you take her please keep up with the reading.  Class is basic goes through the slides the entire class.  I didn't learn much from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2008<br>Class Name: IS433<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arlene does a good job teaching IS. The class is 30% (5 easy assignments), 30% paper (min. 5 pages, you choose IS topic), and 40% final. I took this class DL but I recommend her in class. Read all assigned chapters. Final exam is comprehensive with short answer, multiple choice, and T/F. Must know all terms. Final is closed book/note.</div></div></div></body></html>
