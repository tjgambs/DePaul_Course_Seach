However, his grading criteria is very unclear, he's not very helpful nor does he explain any of his assignments, and he grades everything at the end of the quarter, so you rarely get any feedback. Easy A if you're ready for days of work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Duncan is pretty cool. Take his class if you want a chill LSP seminar prof. He shares really interesting personal insight to the material covered in class and encourages students to do the same. It is a seminar class after all, and you spend the entire three hours discussing the topic. He makes it as bearable as possible. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was laid back and pretty cool, but he never responded to emails. Seemed like this class was just something on the side for him so you could tell he was being lazy with it. It's not too hard, but it's a lot of work. I found myself working on stuff for this class more than stuff for the classes related to my major. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class discussions are eyeopening.

The stuff you learn is interesting and the readings are pretty engaging. Take him if you want a chill class, I'd recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2013<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was informative as we discussed the current issues in education. It required a lot of reading. Work-wise I wouldn't say it was horrible, but he isn't very good with giving clear expectations, feedback, and your papers back. This frustrated many in the class. He has high expectations for you, but he just doesn't communicate them very well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2013<br>Class Name: SCG409<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Duncan was great and very laid back. The class was all discussion so it was very interesting. A few papers to write and he isn't the easiest grader, but easy enough! Be sure to read! I wanted to take 409 over my other two options and I am glad I did. I'd recommend taking this course with him, or any other course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Duncan is a beast. Makes class interesting and definitely makes a night class fun. You will open your mind to so many new things and class discussion flowed very well. Although there is a good amount of writing, the papers were graded easily and there is no midterm or final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2010<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE C.Dunc! SUPER HOT. took his class with my best friend and we drooled over him the whole time. and the class is interesting and he's really helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Surprisingly interesting class, never boring topics, will definitely get exposed to things you've never thought about. Class can get long though. Many easy papers to write on readings & final paper. Easy grader, super easy class while interesting. This prof is very prepared. Most papers take 2 wks to get graded. Just participate every so often.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2010<br>Class Name: SOPHSEM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG He is sooooooo HOTTTTTT! WOW! You will spend the class staring at him daydreaming. Interesting class. Easy prof. Take this class! You will NOT regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Duncan is great.  Night classes are usually long but his lectures are interesting enough to keep the class moving.  Interesting taking a gender studies class by a heterosexual man.  This class is not only for females...lot's of male perspective too.  5 or so papers.  He's an easy grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class and Mr. Duncan is an awesome teacher. He is still young and passionate, so that really helps make that class more interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Duncan is the man, plain and simple. Alot of writing but it is all opinion, so its easy. Lectures are fun and interesting. He is not afraid to voice his opinion to stimulate class debate. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's a Soc 101 class. Everything is common sense. I didn't open the book open and managed to get an A in the class. You'll have a 7-10 pg paper in the end. Don't worry about it, I did it a day beforehand and got an A. As long as you can scribble words together you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof! Really down to earth and likes to joke around with the students. His papers are easy and he's a real fair grader. His lectures can get boring at times, but it's just because the class is BS. I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>other than him being REALLY HOT he's a decent teacher. classes were boring, nothing but power point lectures of key ideas and definitions from the textbook and posts them up on blackboard and relates materials to everyday life. only short answer quizzes (read the material!) and the final was just a paper...i'd take him again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2007<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>JUST TAKE HIM. You wont regreat it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class focuses on sociological issues that you learn in any sociology class, but mannn is Duncan HOT! This man is smokin'! I loved going to class and daydreaming about him all 3 hours and 15 minutes. The class is easy as well. I never got below a 95% on anything. He's an easy grader, easy teacher and he relates to us because he's young and fun!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200GENDER<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The information presented in this class is so cliche and absudly obvious. It is a very liberal class, so watch out for that too. However, it is not Duncan's fault, it is Depaul University's fault for creating such a dumb class... &quot;women are equal&quot; really&#63; I have never heard that before! Obvious BS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Duncan is an excellent professor. He likes to engage the students in the material and is not afraid to offer his own opinions on certain issues in order to stimulate discussion. Lots of papers, but easy grader. If you pay attention, participate in class, and do the work (in short, if you have a pulse)you should have no problem getting a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of papers but awesome professor.  Very interesting discussions in class and loves to get  you to relate material to your life and interests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor...  He is easy going and makes the course fun (watch movies, class discussions) but expect to participate in class and turn in all the assignments on time to get an A.</div></div></div></body></html>
