We didn't really learn much in the class about development.  She's an easy grader and will help students whenever they have a problem.  She also showed some interesting videos.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2008<br>Class Name: SCG434<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Good is GREAT!  She treats her students like the adults they are!  The group work helps us all teach different subjects to the class and look for different ways to get our lessons taught. She is very smart and allows for thinking outside the box. She should teach a class for other professors on how to TEACH GRAD school!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very laid back and easy going. She knows her stuff and treats her students like adults. You need to try really hard to get a bad grade. She lets the class teach the class. Would definitely take her again:)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2008<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She spoke the first day of class and she presented two videos. That was the extent of her instruction.  She let the class read and present each chapter with minimal input to the discussions.  Wonder why I'm paying all this money for her to sit in the back of the room&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2008<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NO invested interest in the class. Props feet up on chair in front of her and complains about how she would rather watch America's Next Top Model!  Did not lecture ONCE the entire quarter.  Books entirely irrelevant.  Never received back work.  Couldn't hand in work early because she didn't want to &quot;help&quot; students.  Waste of money and time!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: SGC403<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Super nice, really interesting class.  She gives a TON of group work and saves all the papers to be due at the end.  Super likable professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2007<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is good, and she's pretty down to earth so if you're in a jam she understands...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: SCU337<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was wonderful.  I got to volunteer rather than write a final paper and I got so much more out of helping under priveleged middle schoolers than researching for a paper.  I love Dr. Good!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2005<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Assisgments that allow creativity</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2005<br>Class Name: SCU337<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She tries to make class easy for all.Very nice and laid back.We didn't do much in class and watched a lot of videos, but they were interesting.Take her if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2005<br>Class Name: SCU337<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely nice.

She brings up issues you would never think to discuss, and her class is very enjoyable. Three hours seems like forever in some classes, but not hers! She relates to students well. I would take her class again, no questions asked!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't even think she read the papers we turned in.  8 pages and all I had was &quot;good job&quot; at the end.  Class gets a little out of control, but super super easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2004<br>Class Name: SCG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A wonderful teacher and a wonderful person.
