Take him if you must but you MUST do the work. Not a bad teacher but very hard to understand. Class is NOT fun and is often boring because it's him talking the entire time. Look over his work because he tends to make mistakes often when doing problems on the board. I would not recommend him for those terrible in math.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quizzes every class. Good teacher, hard class, hard tests. Have to put in the work to get an A. May be hard to understand for some bc he has a slight accent. You do not get out early, but he goes over any questions you may have. Not for slackers or the faint of heart. Absolutely need to do homework - uses homework on exams. Be ready to work!</div></div></div></body></html>
