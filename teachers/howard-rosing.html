    PROF ROSING is AWESOME!!! he is the kindest most understanding guy I've ever had at DePaul. He really cares about his students and is a positive person.  It was a food politic class and the only thing that sucked was that there was a 3-4 page paper answering questions from the readings each week.. exam is so easy and take home. im expecting at leas

    Take this class if you have any desire to learn a lot more about our society than what you see on the news and if you want to try to work to make things better in chicago and the U.S in general. come in with an open mind and read the articles, they are really interesting, this is a great class even if your not a comm serv minor

    I took this as a night class and it was hard to get through partly because I was missing too many Cub games. He is striaghtforward and a nice guy. The class itself is not an interesting topic. Community service is required for this coarse and all other Junior year experimentals.
