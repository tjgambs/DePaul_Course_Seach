This guy is my dude, he made accounting exciting which I was pretty sure couldn't happen. He wants you to do well and is totally there to work for you if you're ready to work for him. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an amazing professor. He made me like accounting even more and I really understood the concepts. He tells you to study the starred slides because that's exactly what he tests you on in the quizzes he gives. With his explanation midterm and final were a breeze. Def take him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2015<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Reddic is the best! Go to his office hours if you need anything because he will gladly help you. He's really fun and interesting so you don't really realize that you're taking one of the hardest classes of the business core. Tip: take notes before the class so you can keep up with the lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2015<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Such an awesome dude, and wicked smart to boot. If you don't do well in the class, it's your own damn fault because Willie provides you with all the tools you need to succeed, even if you're like me and don't have the first clue about accounting. I had him two quarters ago and he still waves to me when I pass him on the street. Love this guy. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2015<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Reddic is one of the best professors at DePaul. He cares and he will remind you of it. His lectures are fast but he's ALWAYS there when you need extra help.  He puts the power point presentation on d2l after class  & he does offer midterm and final review guides.  He teaches you exactly exam materials so you don't have to cram useless information. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Was a great professor to have. Truly cares about you performing well. Lectures are most entertaining they can be and greatly encourages questions. Makes the classroom  not an awkward environment. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div> He will do anything to help you pass that class. He met with many of his students after to help tutor them. His philosophy is that he is their for you.  Around week 4 or 5 he started class off with a survey. He took our feedback and made appropriate changes to the class like more examples and slowed down the lessons. I am still in contact with him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/12/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Reddic is very excited about accounting and will do anything to help you understand. The course in general is confusing at times so you will have to study to fully understand. Spends time before midterm and final to review. Take him. He is very helpful. He's fun. You won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accounting is really a class that chews through freshman as it's 75% tests, and very dry. Willie Reddic is a good professor teaching a difficult subject. If you put in a decent effort, you'll do fine. Also, 25% of the class is just tedious, but helps bolster grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Covers the material pretty fast. Felt like if i read the chapter before class I would be able to follow along better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best professor I've had at DePaul so far. He genuinely wants his students to be successful and tries to make lectures the least boring possible- does a lot of group work and is always willing to help. Online quizzes are due on Saturday afternoons, and there are in-class quizzes every week to review the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really nice guy! He tries to keep the class interesting and he wants everyone to do well. He kind of rushes through the material, so make sure you ask a lot of questions! He gives weekly quizzes and there is online homework due 8am Friday mornings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a great Prof. Always willing to help and also always available for his students.  He really wants to be sure we all understand this course. I really like his teachings plus, he's really funny & attractive !!!!  Thanks to him, I really want to understand accounting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2014<br>Class Name: ACC100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is by far the coolest professor I have ever had. He comes to literally every class with so much good energy. Classes are not boring and he is willing to do whatever to give you extra help. He does move a little quickly, but if you're doing work outside of class it isn't a problem. Online portion to homework. A quiz a week. Extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2014<br>Class Name: ACC100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Goes through the material way too quickly and isn't very clear during his lectures. His powerpoints are however very good overviews of the chapters and they give you all the info for the midterm and final. Not a great teacher though.</div></div></div></body></html>
