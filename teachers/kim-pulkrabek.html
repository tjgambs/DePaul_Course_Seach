And although she is a a nice person, her lectures are very basic and barely helps with the homework.. which is online. The online homework doesn't help at all. Very difficult to understand the content when you it's multiple choice. Not a very good teacher. She's not recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2010<br>Class Name: CHEM100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best.

Did not tell us when writing assignments are due and is too hard of a grader for not telling us what she expects. DO NOT TAKE HER..

Does not tell you what she expects on writing assignments, which makes grades even worse.  I would avoid her at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2008<br>Class Name: CHE175<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lab instructor made me hate orgo. Spent more time first lab telling us how to pronounce her name rather than purpose of exp. Stalked around lab looking over our shoulders but never offering help only criticism. Definitely had favorites.  Made snide remarks like use a powder funnel for powder transfer you know that's why its called &quot;powder&quot; funnel.</div></div></div></body></html>
