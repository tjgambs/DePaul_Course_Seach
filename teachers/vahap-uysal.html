There is a lot of information that he covers but you will find lots of uses for it later on. I would take again, but you have to be on top of your game. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Doctor Uysal is one of the best professors I have taken at DePaul. Yes the material is really hard and his final was complete bs but honestly If you put a lot of time into this class any other Finance course will seem like a joke (which is good because you can sit back and relax). If you want to be knowledgable about finance this is your guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: 362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Wow, save yourself the hassle.  Tests are super hard, he loves to give surprise questions, does not tell you what to expect, doesn't even pass back the midterm, has the most insane grading scale for a Finance class I have ever seen, and my personal opinion is that he doesn't even care if you pass or fail.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>The professor is great, but dont get me wrong, this class was VERY challenging. 5 quizzes and 1 pop quiz, all contain three questions pertaining to the previous two lectures.  A midterm and a final. The final was VERY difficult. Not enough time to complete the test. If you put in the work you should receive a decent grade. He is very knowledgeable </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Uysal means very well, but teaches with a heavy accent and a fundamental focus on the math behind risk management.  Classes are always over 3 hours, and he does not clarify his examples during class.  5 Quizzes, 1 Pop Quiz, and some extra credit.  Very tough class.  Have to want to study and know eccentric formulas to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I've taken at Depaul. Subject is hard and doesn't provide means to try and overcome that. Throws material at you, and expects you to memorize it. Around 30-60 slides per lecture. He WILL pick on every single student at least once during class, which wouldn't be much problem if he actually taught the material. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Uysal has a thick accent, but he is a GREAT professor. The notes cover everything that you need to know. 5 quizzes + 1 pop quiz with the lowest score dropped. Plus midterm, final, and option for 2% extra credit. If you study for each of the quizzes and exams, you will do great! No surprises on the quizzesexams. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2014<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor. Learned a lot. Requires a bit of studying before quizzes / exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2014<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor. Not an easy class by any means, the pace is a little fast but it's a lot of material to cover. Towards the second half everything starts to come together. If you actually pay attention in class and go over your notes, the quizzes and tests are identical to the ones you go over in class. I'd  definitely recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2014<br>Class Name: FIN362H<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very strict. Hard to understand. The class is amazing though. If you like to learn, take it. Funny guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2014<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away. Hard to understand anything he says. Goes over concepts way too fast and tests you on them as if somehow you were an expert. Horrible experience. I passed his class but moving forward, I won't find anything he tried to teach useful whatsoever. Knows a lot about the subject and will test you based on his experience and knowledge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2014<br>Class Name: FIN362<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Vahap is not a good professor.  He is Turkish and does not understand American culture at all.  He is unclear regarding test material and does not discuss grading policy at all.  Avoid him if you want to avoid a headache.</div></div></div></body></html>
