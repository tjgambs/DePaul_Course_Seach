    Seriously loved this class. You learn so much and there is a LOT of hands on activity, which I love. You go on a lot of field trips and meet authors. There are a few papers, but mostly reflection. I didn't even read the books and got A's. Totally recommend this class. Meyer is super funny, nice, and knows a lot about the topic.

    The class was interesting but Karen tends to be rude to her students. Prepared to be called out in front of everyone for doing something wrong. She grades easily and will not accept any late work. She relies on the readings a lot so make sure you read for her class.

    Makes class pretty interesting. Lots of information. No notes, only 2 books and they are both novels. A few papers, but they are short and mostly reflection. Attendance is pretty mandatory because if you don't go to class you might not be able to write a couple of the papers and she won't help you. Overall it was a great class.

    She's a really easy Professor but her class is totally interesting. You learn a lot whether you pay attention or doze off. Plus she shows you how being disabled isn't the end of the world.

    Great professor. Keeps the class interesting and it's easy to relate to the articles she gives. As long as you pay attention in class and do the paper, you'll be fine. I recommend her course.

    Karen Meyer was an amazing professor. She definitely was able to relate to everything she taught in the class. I highly recommend taking her Disability Culture class for freshman focal point seminar.

    Awesome professor! Really easy. Just come to class, dont even really have to pay attention, but its interesting anyways. All reflection papers and she's an easy grader. She does tend to have favorites so try to get on her good side. I'd reccomend this class for an easy A!

    Easy course. I wanted the course to be more about Chicago's actual disabled community, but it was more about disabled community in general and Chicago disabled services. Professor Meyer is nice.

    Karen Meyer is disabled herself, so you'd think (teaching a disabled class) she'd push her own views/expect you to know every historical detail, but she doesn't. She only wants you to learn, enjoy the class and grow as a student. Who wouldn't want that from their teacher&#63; Two Thumbs Up! Bravo Karen Meyer!!

    I think this class was really intersting. Profesor Meyer really is explains everything well, you have to read! Particapte its important and show up for class. The final paper can be challenging depending on what orgazantion you choose to focus on, however, you really do learn a lot from this class in the end. I think its a great class

    Great teacher, not much work just a short chapter or two for each class which you can skim in order to participate in class.  Final paper is 10 pages but not hard at all.  I'm not usually an A student and I got an A in her class.  I missed 2 classes, never read, and still got an A.  Take this class!

    Karen is VERY knowledgeable on the subject matter.  She has a lot of compassion on the subject as well. If you do the reading each week (which is not a lot at all!) and pay attention you'll be fine.There are three papers due throughout the qtr, but shes very generous with the grades. TAKE HER CLASS!
