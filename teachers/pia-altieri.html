    Pia is a great professor. She knows how to stir her students minds. She's incredibly smart. It would be fun to pick her brain. She's got a great sense of humor and is down to earth/approachable.

    I'm going to be very blunt about this. WORST PROFESSOR EVER! Do not take her because you will regret it. I don't understand how she's still teaching. DePaul needs to fire her IMMEDIATELY. Unfair grader. I followed the prompt even went to the extent of going to the writing center and she still gave me a poor grade because we did not get along. Avoid

    Professor Alteri is super passionate about what's she's teaching, but let's face it, she's a mess. She gives too much information, that ultimately still leaves you in the dark as far as what she wants. If you're not super interested in the subject, don't take her. You'll just wind up irritated and stressed over her huge in concise assignments.

    The grades were about 10 A, 10 B and 15 C. This professor was unorganized and incomprehensible. There were 2 tests,a 12 page paper &amp; a final. The teacher never explained what an A paper was. She expected the class to guess what ethics was and never taught it. I would  avoid this teacher. It is very hard and nearly impossible to get a good grade.

    Pia was the worst professor I have ever had.  Not only are her notes a mess and the class does lack clarity, but it seems that she is pushing her faith on you at times.  She assumes that all of her class believes in and loves God.  She taught us about how God's love affects us and how God's love prevented saints body's from decomposing.Worst prof

    Professor Altieri is one of the best professors i have ever had. She helped me a lot to become a better individual in so many levels. If you really pay attention to what she's saying and take notes you won't have a problem in her class. I would recommend her!!!

    Professor Altieri doesn't assign homework. This makes it so that you have two grades all together. So if you screw up then you screw up. She does not write in legible words but signs on the board. She does all this because she is lazy. If she cared one ounce for her students then she would write in actual words on the board.

    Altieri's class isn't for people who want an easy A. You actually have to use your brain and work for it, but it is extremely rewarding. She's tough, but she is always willing to help. She was educated at 2 of the best schools in this country. Attend class, do the readings, pay attention, put effort into it, and you are golden. slackers beware!

    this teacher has changed my life. idk why so many people have had a problem with her. Her class is not that hard. Just attend every class pay attention, and email her or ask her in class if you have a question. There is no way you can fail this class as long as you do the work. She is very nice and always willing to help.

    Altieri is a horrible professor. She is all over the place when she teaches. Her notes and grading system are extremely confusing. She uses numbers and symbols instead of actual coherent sentences. Do yourself a favor and avoid any of her classes.

    She is the worst teacher at DePaul.  No matter how hard you try you will never be able to wrap your head around anything her hampster says.  She may be a Harvard graduate, but she a complete idiot.  DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER!

    Where do I begin about Pia...well, she is very interesting and knowledgeable about religion, but what she expects from a 10 week course is near impossible.  She crams a lot of information in every session, and still seems to have time to go off on ridiculous tangents.  Her communicating skills are quite inefficient as well.  I don't recommend!

    Nice lady, but really, really horrible teacher. Will send you three pages of instructions on how to write your paper, but they are so incomprehensible that you still can't figure it out. Asking for clarification results in twenty minutes of rambling with no satisfactory answer. Plus, you will be unpleasantly surprised by your grade. AVOID.

    She means well and loves what she does, but it felt more like my quarter was spent trying to figure out how to pass a class taught by Atieri than how to learn about human rights and religion.  She can be very confusing and she seems to assume that everyone is operating on her same wavelength... which is way strange.  That said, an A is possible.

    Kind of out there. Would have never thought she went to Harvard. Always talks about hampsters. She rates your yawns, so try to hold them back if you dont like being called out in class. She is kind of scatter brained when explaining material so you have to really pay attention and come to class or you will be really lost.

    She's pretty scatter-brained so sometimes its hard to keep in step with her. Her notes are wacky so mostly just listen to what she says and ignore what she writes. She's real anal about detail and specifics in your writing to the point of rediculousness. Overall she's not the worst i've had but if you can avoid her, do it.

    I was kinda worried about this class when I first took it but I have to honestly say that if you pay attention and participate, you will walk out of this class knowing more about yourself and the kind of person you want to become. Professor Altieri is kinda quirky, but at the same time she is really nice and more than helpful if you have problems.

    She'd be great to just have a conversation with, but her class had no structure, and she didn't even follow her own syllabus. For someone who brags about going to Harvard, she hasn't a clue what constitutes proper grammar. Paper grades may surprise you in a bad way. Don't take her if you like structured classes or if you want to learn anything at all.

    She is a good hearted Prof. but in school thats not what you want.  She uses too many symbols to explain her lesson, and gets too touchy about her subject.  Its good that she likes her class but it was jus too much for me. She gives too much work,and  I would not reccomend her.

    Pretty much the worst professor I've ever had in my life. I'm fairly certain I'd have been better off if this course had been taught by a kindergarten teacher. At least they know how to write. She draws pictures and arows all over the board, constantly talks in circles about the same religious cliches. I'm not sure how she is a teacher at all.

    Energetic and interesting professor. Assignments weren't bad, though the essay topics, and sometimes her lectures, were a bit unclear (she has quite a vague writing style). Still, as long as you incorporate what was dicussed in class, you'll do well!

    My worst experience at DePaul.  Class =  mediocre films and books (2 Mitch Albom books!) and constantly discussing the same themes.  Class begins to feel like deja-vu - the same, unrelated lecture every day.  Grades papers based on how many &quot;a-ha&quot;s you make, not if you make intelligent or articulate points.  Avoid at all costs.

    A very nice, laid-back, and helpful professor. She is an ethics professor and, even though I took her &quot;comparative world religions&quot; class, the focus of the class was really on ethics, morals, and values of certain individuals not religions--which is my only complaint. Read &quot;Tuesdays with Moorie,&quot; if you like the book you will surly like the class.

    She's friendly and means well but that's about it. The class starts off easy (you can get away with not reading a book a week) but then it piles on and you will grow tired of a-has, unpack, and hamster remarks. Emailed reading guides make no sense. You will read at least 4 books, pdfs, 5 papers (3 in the last 2 weeks). Seek another option...

    Textbook barely (if ever) used; she assigns readings and movies that you must work in groups to decifer. The whole class is based off of group work, with 3 tests. She grades hard on your writing and you must &quot;unpack&quot; everything you jot down. Also the bragging about Harvard is no lie-- she mentions it atleast once per class. She's also overenergetic

    This class is not an easy ride. You have to work in it, but it's not impossible like other classes.  A lot of the time you can put in your own views and opinions on the tests/paper.  She's an pretty cool prof. Readings are easy.

    Horrible professor and lecturer. Brags everyday that she went to Harvard and she is complete imbecile who assigns insipid and mediocre texts and assigns barely sketched out paper topics. Terrible jokes too. Avoid at all costs.

    If you have an option of taking it with someone else, take it. She is all over the place, assignes stuff late and gives it back late (if ever). 80% of all the course work is in the last two weeks-you have to produce almost 2 papers/week. She writes numbers instead of comments on the papers and wants you to micro analyze everything. Also-she makes you watch rap videos in order to find 'deeper meaning' in them. Just avoid!

    I just got my grade back for summer-I don't feel it is what I deserved. This teacher utilizes movies and TV program as though they are fact. Her exams and material are extremely simple but she grades like she's teaching neurology. This class should have been an easy A. With all the bright people in my class, I'm surprised anyone got less than an A.

    She has No teaching skills, No hand-eye corridination, and No idea what she is doing.  All she does is talk nonsense and draws animals on the board.  Her grading is insane.  She makes up all the information you learn on her own.  This class was pointless and made no sense.  Oh, and she never went to Harvard, she just talks a lot of smack.  RUN RUN!

    Great teacher. I would highly recommend her, her teaching style is a bit wild but she keeps it interesting. If you go to class you will probably get an A or a B, just write down what she says and you will be golden for the quizzes and the final. Our final was open book.

    So unclear you will want to rip your hair out. She made the class much more difficult than it had to be. She's funny, but thats all she has got going for her. Don't let her humor mask her inability to teach.

    EASY EASY EASY A!!!!   Most people complained about her notes on the board, but you are lucky she is even doing that!!  Most of my teachers do not do that.  Plus you don't need to look at the board, just listen to what she says and write it down.   It was a very easy business ethics course compared to any of the other teachers.

    Nice teacher, however she was mean to a couple of friends of mine. She is also confusing, she writes a lot of the stuff on the board using pictures, she uses Greek and Hebrew letters it seems when she does write on the board, and she has students teach a lot of the class. She is also not very organized. Some of the class was interesting, however.

    she is a sweet lady but definitely has an alternative teaching style. do the reading and take good notes, you should be fine. be prepared for a busy last few weeks, she dumps on a bunch of extra work at the end. be honest with her and she will help you, she wants her kids to do well.

    This might have been the most boring class I have ever taken. Quizzes are hard. Alot of readings. Last two weeks of class she goes crazy with assigning all this stuff. Students teach the class not her because she makes every student steach the class atleast once with what she class as the daily respondent.

    the class is simple, but she's EXTREMELY disorganized. also, pictures may have been OK in her college notes, but they're foreign for most students. means well, but needs a new job. biggest gripe = weekly reading guides. one list at the beginning of the quarter would be far more appropriate. i'm convinced she's making the course up as it goes along.

    everyone is complaining about her notes.. they are bad BUT she means well. You can easily get an A or B if you do the work (and its not hard work like everyone is saying) the quizes however, you MUST do the reading AND ITS NOT HARD READING.its short and you go over EVERYTHING in great detail in class so you'll be fine. Id take her for another class

    dont get afraid about the low scores this woman has. she is easy. shes like a little kid; she draws picture on the board isntead of notes, so instead of learnign half the time we are playing pictionary. and like previously stated, if you get a tree drawn at the end of your paper, that means you got an A. shes an interesting character. i love norm

    the note she writes on the board are in short hand or hieroglyphics, you spend 10 mins trying to figure out what she is drawing. New reading guide every week. Honestly I think she wings it each week. grades with pictures, if you like grammer school teaching take this class. SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO TEACH! total waste of time
