She was condescending, unavailable by email, and discouraging.  Take the class from an instructor who cares. Very middle-school-oriented.  Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2010<br>Class Name: TL424<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is quite funny. Definitely grades harder than most and sometimes I found her grading system hard to understand. Will let you improve your grade. She's been in this profession for a long time. A bit hard to communicate with through email. Try reaching her over the phone. That may help. You will learn a lot about lesson plan preparation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: TANDL424<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Mau is one of the best. She's personable, professional, and knowledgable about education, plus she dresses great!We learned practical skills to use in the classroom and really helped build a solid foundation in teaching. We delved into portfolio development, teaching philosophies, and lesson presentation. Ideas are respected in her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2009<br>Class Name: TL425<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very helpful lot of unit planning for teachers must have all work completed and in!

She's extremely helpful, obviously passionate about contributing to our development as teachers, she's funny and flexible and always prepared - you cover a lot in class, and she shares with you little details about teaching (she's still teaching in middle school). Great prof, highly recommended!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/16/2006<br>Class Name: TL405<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Mau is not readily available by e-mail or appointments if you need to speak to her outside of class. She also has a very dry personality, which I found quite uncomfortable. There was a general consensus among many of us in the course that we were not always comfortable during open discussion, because she could be somewhat condescending.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: TL405<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely fantastic teacher.  Funny, interesting, and very clear on assignments and making sure you're on track.  Grading on reflections a little harder than I'm used to, but with just a little bit of work, you can still pull off an A.</div></div></div></body></html>
