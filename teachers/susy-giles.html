No, this is not a blow off class, but you will learn a lot from her if you do the work.  One midterm project, one final, one group exercise and a presentation.  I highly recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: ARTART<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have always loved art, however when I took this class with her, she literally made it seem as if it was a 300 level course, and it was a 100 level! I truly believe that she is a tough grader, especially with participation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2010<br>Class Name: ART113<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Also took ART 115 with her. She is a genuinely nice woman but she is not the most personable teacher I have ever had. She doesn't offer much advice or guidance and she grades fairly hard and it is not entirely clear what you should be doing to get that A instead of a B. She is serious about her job but you will learn much in her classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2010<br>Class Name: ART115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Giles is a great professor! It is not by any means an easy class, but it is fun and challenging. She is definitely here to help and doesn't want to see you fail. A plaster carving and a Cast clay head are the two projects, with mini presentations in between and a final paper. Awesome if you're into art and good with your hands!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2009<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely nice, patient and caring lady. She made art class so fun for me =) I enjoyed the field trip we had to take to the Art Museum. No books need, only an art kit costing $60. Take her, you wont regret it =)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2009<br>Class Name: ART113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The way Susy teaches is so perfect for non-art majors because the projects are all challenging, but accessible.  She still demands quality, not just effort, so it's not a cop-out class. I was really pushed to make amazing things and I suggest beginning sculpture to ANYONE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2009<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, challenging, but also inspiring, willing to help in any way as well as allows you to better your grade if you do not like what you ended up with.  Highly recommend for those who are serious about art.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: ART113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Susy definitely challenged me.  For the most part I thought her grading was fair- not easy though.  She grades especially hard on participation surprisingly.  I definitely learned a lot in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2007<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Giles is okay.. She's really skinny, but that's besides the point. but other than that the class is cool. If you dont like spending around 12hrs a week on hw, then I suggest you don't take her class. There is a final paper that you'll have to go to the chicago art museum for in order to complete. she's interesting though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2007<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher, her assignments are very diverse and fun but also challenging. you will spend a lot of time on them, probably more then you want, but its basic art so its not that hard, just time comsuming. for critque days talk a lot, they might be worth only a small percentage but its a good way to show her participation which helps with other grades</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2006<br>Class Name: ART110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>2-d foundations: (didn't know class #-sorry) NO TEXTBOOKS! About $70 in materials, but you get to keep all of those. Wonderful teacher that completely explains all of her assignments and expectations. Projects are very time consuming, but as an Art major I loved it. You do not have to know how to draw at all- we use tracing paper- a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/15/2006<br>Class Name: BEGDRAWING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was great at acknowledging the various skill levels in the class, and encouraging both ends of the spectrum.  Her class is relatively challenging, (graded homework and assignments) but she was an extremely fair grader. Some of the best critiques I was in last year were from this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2006<br>Class Name: BEGDRAW<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seems pretty tough at first but she is extremely helpful and nice as the class goes on. I recommend this class to non art majors because she is very understanding of those with lesser art skills. Lots of sketchbook hmwk assignments (not hard at all). No tests, just final drawings that you finish in class for critiques.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2005<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very good professor.

She understands not everyone is an artist and she grades very fairly.  I would love to take more ART classes with her if I could.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2005<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is cool but she gives too much homework. She will grade the homework easily but you might not have enough time to do it. Don't take this class if you don't havve any time. Otherwise, it's a fun class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>a little rough on the edges at first- but incredibly brilliant and motivating as the course progresses</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: ART115<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best art Prof I have ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2004<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Susy is definitely a fun and interesting teacher.
