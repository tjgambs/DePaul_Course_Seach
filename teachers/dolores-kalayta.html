Database is not hard but I like learning one step at a time especially if I have other classes to take. I understand some of you guys do this on a regular basis so it comes easy but when you teach an intro, you should teach in a manner where you assume people don't understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/19/2013<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very clear and is happy to answer any questions.

Read text book and ask questions. Cheat sheet allowed for exams. HW will help understand the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2012<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Read the text, ask questions. She's pretty strict on the code, but it's programming, so she has to be strict. Overall, good class. Not easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2009<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a bad teacher but not a great teacher. Sometimes it was easy to space out during a lecture but maybe that was just because I knew the material fairly well before taking a class.  She utilizes COL-Web well and is very quick and informative when it comes to grading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2009<br>Class Name: IT236<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I left this class with a clear understanding of the subject matter. Her lectures are crystal clear and she give you all of the tools needed to succeed. The mid term/final are hard HOWEVER she is very clear on what the requirements are.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: IT236<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree that she is demanding, but I came away from the class with a clear understanding of visual basic. I think it is important to note that as you move into writing the more difficult programs, she gives infinitely more help. She practically wrote the last two programs for the entire class.  Pay a bit of attention and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: IT236<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I disagree with the previous comment.  She's not a bad teacher at all, just fairly difficult and demanding for a class labled as &quot;IT236&quot;.  I've taken many 300 level courses and am confused as to why this is only a 200 level course..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2006<br>Class Name: IT236<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the worst teacher i have ever had. if you are a graphics major and ahave to take it236, do NOT take it with her!</div></div></div></body></html>
