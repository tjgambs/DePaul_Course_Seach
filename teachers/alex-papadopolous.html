Now there is A LOT of reading, and usually the lectures are not based on the reading. BUT in order to do well on midterm and final (which were take home) you have to know the reading.  Ask him for help! He's very welcoming and understandable when it comes to students and dilemmas.  Purely lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2012<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Required freshman class, but he made it interesting--lots of field trips, good lectures.

Midterm and Final in-class written exam then a final research project with presentation. Talks the entire class, with break. If you like a long lecture this is your class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2010<br>Class Name: GEO233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this course that I needed for a requirement. This class is about &quot;world cities&quot; and the history of some major cities and how they deveolped. This includes economy, goverment, society, and geographical influence. If you like those things take this class. He's awesome and helpful, I just do not understand social sciences.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2009<br>Class Name: REL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is quite possibly the most knowledgeable person of his given subject that I've ever met.  If you are into studying cities, this is the man to know.  He amazed me on a daily basis with his casual use of vast amounts of knowledge.  He is a great person, also.  Humble and not demeaning.  That said, you need to read and study quite a bit for the A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2008<br>Class Name: GEO201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful teacher.  Very jolly, sweet man.  Actually worked for the UN so he is VERY knowledgeable.  I learned so much from him.  He is very encouraging of questions and discussion.  I would definately take him again. Tough grader, though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/12/2008<br>Class Name: GEO201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazingly informed on the subject; outstanding lecturer; demanding but fair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2008<br>Class Name: GEO316<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing command of all things &quot;European Union&quot;.

I didn't understand most of what he said; neither did the rest of the class. If you're really into geopolitics, take the class, otherwise, take something you enjoy. Knowledgeable, but he expected, from freshmen honors students, senior-level work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2008<br>Class Name: GEO201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is too much readings. But the worst part is that he doesn’t explain anything completely, he assumes you know all European and Middle East conflicts. The texts also don’t explain anything from the beginning they are more like a criticism of what have already been said. My class also did bad in the midterm and he had to curve the final grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2007<br>Class Name: GEO201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too much reading not clear to follow especially if you have no previous geopolitics knowledge, the prof is picky with what he wants in his tests, more than half of my class failed midterm. Midterm, 6 pg group research paper, and final. It really piles up in the end, in order to do well have to do the readings! Still Papadopoulos is a very nice man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2007<br>Class Name: GEO201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>yeah, its interesting but way too much work for a 201 class. crazy research paper and final. only take this if you are a int or geo major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2006<br>Class Name: GEO201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Beautiful Greek Man!!! and lovely prof too, very interesting and clear</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2006<br>Class Name: GEO201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Geopolitics is not really my thing so this class was kind of challenging for me, but he was very helpful and met with me to discuss papers and stuff. He was very nice and VERY excited about his subject. If your not a fan of geopolitics then I wouldn't reccomend the class but if you have to take it I would deffinitly reccomend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: HON204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a great guy. This class, is not easy though.. so if you want an easy A, look somewhere else! However, if you like a challenge and want to learn a lot-- take him! He knows his stuff and I def. got my money's worth in this class.He's a funny guy with a GREAT accent and has a whoooole lot to talk about!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: GEOPOLITICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very interesting and helpful. I went to hid office, and he was very willing to talk to me about my academic problems.  I loved him!

However, this is not an easy class.  Be prepared to do a lot of work if you want to do well.  It is not impossible, by any means, you will learn a lot and meet one of the best profs at DePaul.  Great teacher.  Highly reccomend him for any class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Globalization - He can be hard to understand (Greek for sure!) but was a good teacher...until grading. Grades unfairly and biased towards past stereotypes. Not very helpful, and picky on subject matter. Ignores the positive to chase the negative on assignments. Seems like a blow-off class, but it isn't, by far.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: EUROPEANUNION<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor, very nice and intelligent guy.  For this class: boring lectures, horrible book, strange class format and grading scheme.  He was very lenient about our midterm, though, and could have made it WAY WAY harder.  The final paper (done in pairs) was graded according to criteria he didn't give us.  Worst thing a prof can do, by far!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: GEO201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures were super boring and unrelated. a lot of people skipped regularly or just left early. assigns a huuggee research project for the end of the semester. mid-term isnt so bad, but he grades hard. got a D on midterm, but managed to get a B at the end of class. just had to work harder.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Can be scary at first. Especially when you are a freshman. Talks to make the class seem hard. Can be hard if you dont do work. Also can be intersting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: ISO102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting.  He really cares about his students.  He was my favorite professor last semester, and I am really interested in GEO now.  I will take a class with him again if i get the chance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2004<br>Class Name: GEO300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart, very passionate about Geography. Was more than willing to help us out in any way we needed and acclimate his course to us individually. He's tough, but worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2004<br>Class Name: HON204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic professor who is very intelligent.

I wouldn't recommend him though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2004<br>Class Name: EXPCHIC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor to welcome you to college.

Funny and very open minded. He expects you to do the readings and write well. He only gives one midterm, one final, and two group projects. If you screw one up, DROP.
