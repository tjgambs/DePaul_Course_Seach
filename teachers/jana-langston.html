She makes you raise your namecard when you answer a question bc she is too lazy to rememeber names for the ONLY class she teaches. She only knows commerical real-estate and loves to talk about herself!!! Easy class, you need the book for quizzes but puts you to sleep.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2008<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an easy grader, but useless when it comes to a teacher... Her class is mandatory, but it is SO hard to pay attention to her boring lectures.  Midterm & final super easy and come right from her quiz questions.</div></div></div></body></html>
