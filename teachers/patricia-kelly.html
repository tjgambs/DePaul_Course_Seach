I thought she was a good hip teacher. Very knowledgable and understanding. agree with what others say below. I ended up getting a B even though I was disapointed with a C on my paper. I liked her though, learned alot about different paintings and artists</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2007<br>Class Name: ART322<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really smart and gives great lectures. However, you have to take great notes and study your ass off to get a B on the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice person, and definately knows her stuff, but her class sucks, this course wasn't the bs course i expected, definately demanded lots of studying and attendance. You don't learn as much as you memorize slides. One paper, she demands a lot of detail for paper and definately tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy requirement A. fast-paced lecture, but make sure to take a lot of notes so you can ace the exams. super easy. don't buy the book! you won't need it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2006<br>Class Name: ART239<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All memorization for tests, 3 written assignments are easily graded but the midterm and final take lots of studying to learn all the images and details about them, easy B but with lots of studying, took me 2 days to learn all the images we were tested on, need to go to class to get all the details, 5 images to write about for the exams out of 30</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: HON202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2005<br>Class Name: CONTEMPORARY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is nice but she talks really fast and notes are all over the place. She is organized but its hard to organize your notes when she talks. I learned so much from her course. 2 papers,midterm, final. The art is interesting but the concepts behind them are a bit difficult-very philosophical. She will help you but be ready for work- its not easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty boring class looking at slides everyday.  The tests are straightfoward.  She is a relatively tough grader although you wouldnt think so after meeting her.  You dont even have to go to class if you have the book and study it for the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2005<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like art, you'll like this class. Pretty tough grader, though. She knows what she's talking about. Take notes. Don't buy the book, I didn't and never needed it once.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: ART239<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher grades extremely subjectively and plays favorites. Guys beware... Also, dont bother to buy the book, she wants you to regurgetate her lectures... the book wont help much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: ART239<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great professor. has great knowledge of the topic and makes it really easy to understand. she tries to make the class as easy as possible for her students. she picks only the slides that have been greately discussed for the test. would highly recommend her as an art professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: ART<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Trish Kelly is so smart, and she really makes you appreciate the arts, if you know I mean.  I wish all teachers were like Professor Kelly. I took this course in the winter, but spring has definitely sprung.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: ART235<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is awesome, with sense of humor.
