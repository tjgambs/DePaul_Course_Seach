Benson is painfully clear about his grading criteria and EXACTLY what you need to do to earn an A. It is NOT a blow off class, there are homework assignments almost every class, but they are very manageable. Tests are all online and are very nit picky, primarily designed to see if you read the text. Overall great professor and a solid class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2015<br>Class Name: 229<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher! Always there if needed and lectures fluently. States whats on test and points it out as well. It is an easy A as long as you do the readings.. all of them.. watch the videos and don't miss discussion posts. Those will make that A at the end. Great teacher overall. Favorite thus far at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2014<br>Class Name: REL229<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Benson is absolutely great! He's super funny and  down to earth and he's very clear with what you need to know for exams (which are online!) If you go to class, he'll specifically say, "this will be on the exam." Notes are very clear. Don't miss any discussion posts! It'll make or break your A! He's so awesome though, and it's a great class!</div></div></div></body></html>
