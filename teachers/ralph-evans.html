Lectures were always clear and precise. Never rejected anyone for asking questions, he actually encouraged them. There is a lot of material to learn, but with enough studying this class was no big deal. Professor Evans thanks for an insightful course. Keep up the good work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2009<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting professor. Appears to be on mass amounts of caffeine. Does NOT allow questions for clarification during class. Also will scrutinize every sentence of your paper for plagiarism. Does a great job of explaining concepts visually. Study for his exams and don't cheat.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2009<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor I've had.  Tons of work- 9 worksheets, 9 in class assingments, 5 papers, 3 exams.  Tests are very hard, even though I actually read, took notes, and studied.  Horribly boring, teaches exactly as it is in the book-waste of time and my money.  Don't take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2009<br>Class Name: PSY360<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So I signed up for a class with this guy and got Matt Evans as a teacher.  Son&#63; Same guy using a middle name&#63;  All I have to say is its time to pick a new career.  He was awful! Taught power points straight from the book.  And guess what buddy, when the whole class does bad on a test, its not the class, its you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2009<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class. Must study for his exams. They are hard. Not a blow off class at all. 7 Reflection papers, a midterm and a final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2009<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy. Five reflection papers and five quizzes. A final paper, midterm and final exam. He's very knowledgeable on the subject and will help if you ask.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2008<br>Class Name: PSY360<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He can seem dry, but he is actually an okay guy.  His teaching is good overall.  Tests are okay, but we had to write an 8 page paper, which was kind of a pain.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is a challenge! READ THE BOOK! Questions on quizzes and on test are not necessarily from his lectures. You will learn so much if you take advantage of this course.He drops lowest quiz score and lowest response paper score and gives a lot of extra credit, enough boost your grade up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>5 quizzes from readings and notes. 5 reflection papers from readings and notes. 1 final paper. Midterm and a Final. You HAVE to study. You HAVE to know all names in conjunction with their theories and be able to describe them. Not a blow off at all. Doesn't return papers or quizzes- instead encourages office hours. Nice guy. Not bad at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2007<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
