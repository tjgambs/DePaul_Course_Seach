Midterm, Final, 4 homeworks, and a group project.  Not that difficult, just pay attention and you'll get an A.  Also had class activities every class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>About average as a Research Methods teacher. The entire class is based around a group project in which you test your own correlational experiment. On top of this there is a midterm and final exam, each of which have about average difficulty.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2015<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a really easy grader, his classes were lecture based and he always relied on slide shows and little clips to teach his class. I didn't mind that at all, I just wish he would have given us more time to write the actual notes. He always sped through them very fast. He gives occasional pop quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2015<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice, approachable young professor. Professional and organized. Classes mostly lecture but I thought the material was interesting so I didn't mind, and I enjoyed his commentary. Tests were easy, multiple choice only. Homework rare & easy. A lot of pop quizzes (easy 100s) so go to class & go ON TIME! Take notes and read your book for an easy A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2014<br>Class Name: PSYCH104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Cool guy, just needs to slow down a bit on his lectures and change his teaching techniques every once in a while. STUDY YOUR NOTES- he gives pop quizzes almost everyday. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First time teacher and didn't know how to teach this type of course. HORRIBLE explanations. Homeworkactivities not explained well. Exams are okay. HORRIBLE with setting up group projects and knowing how to effectively teach them. Couldn't explain analyzingrunning the data at all. Worst "professor" I've had at DePaul so far. Sad because he's nice.</div></div></div></body></html>
