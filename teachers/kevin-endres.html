    Kevin was really bad at providing feedback. Never saw any feedback on the quizzes which made them feel like a complete waste of time and energy. Also took awhile to get the midterm paper back, he mentioned how he was working on his own film and you could really tell it took precedence over the class what a waste of tuition.
