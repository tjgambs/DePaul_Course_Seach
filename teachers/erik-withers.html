His class isn't the hardest, but there is still some work involved.

Seriously all we do all day is watch videos of tv shows and talk about how they're related to society. He's hilarious and is practically a kid himself. This class is ridiculously easy so it's awesome. Best professor ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ridiculously easy...watch lots of films and shows. In class, he spends time talking about his weekend and thinks about what he should be talking about. Not exactly a teacher by any means. Awkward guy...not the brightest... but nice and easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His teaching isn't the greatest, but he's nice and definitely deserves the chili pepper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took professor Withers for my sophomore seminar. By far my favorite teacher I've had. Very smart and a great sense of humour. A lot of discussion in his classes with very little lecture, easy grader too. You won't be dissapointed if you take his class.</div></div></div></body></html>
