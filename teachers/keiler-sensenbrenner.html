It's weird how she knows though because she never once did role call.  She's nice but strict.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2009<br>Class Name: ART218<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Somewhat helpful, tends to favor higher level students. I have received minimal attention from her during class time on drawings. Does not control class volume well, which is important in a studio art class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2008<br>Class Name: ART218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I heard that she kickboxes in her free time.  Sounds awesome to me-- you should ask her about it in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2007<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice and helpful. But she is a little strict on attendance and tardinees. She dropped my grade for being tardy! Take her she is really nice overall!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2007<br>Class Name: GPH211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is funny and nice, although if it's a night class it's kind of hard to sit till the end, but she always helps everybody.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2007<br>Class Name: GPH211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  She knows the material can be dry and tries to make it fun, but the lectures can still be a little boring.  Very lenient on attendance even though she says it's mandatory.  Would definitely recommend to everyone I know!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2007<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice, and as long as you do ALL your work and show up to class you should be fine. Be make sure you follew directions concisely too though, because you might have the most beautiful piece in the critique, but if it isn't what she wanted get prepared for your grade to hurt. But I say take her, she is very good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: GPH211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's her first year teaching this course, and she really tried.  Knows plenty about art and theory, so class isn't one dimensional.  She has a great personality and she's really easy going.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2007<br>Class Name: GPH211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is really sweet.  It is hard for her to get people to assist her in critiquing student's photoshop art. If you help, she'll definitely help you out.  Really easy going even when photoshop becomes difficult to deal with.  Definitely recommended for new art students/elective.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2006<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's nice,but very picky on ur work.it's art-an expression class-and she'll say ur work is wrong.she says she's an artist who's suck-perhaps it's bc she lacks creativity.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!
