    She is a great professor &amp; her midtermfinal review guides are just like the actual exams. The bad part is the time-consuming online hw &amp; quizzes done through Cengage, which is a pain, but you have to put in the effort. Lectures are long, boring powerpoint slides. Just do what you're supposed to and you will get at least a B if not an A.

    Professor Dabrowska goes extremely (and sometimes painfully) slow to make sure everyone knows what's going on, since this is one of the most commonly failed classes at DePaul. All you need to purchase for this class is the online content (Cengage) so do not waste money on the physical textbook. Be aware that your midtermfinal are always on Friday.

    She is an amazing professor. Accounting 101 is not an easy class in itself but she does a wonderful job explaining the material. VERY helpful, goes over homework &amp; quizzes. There is no way you shouldn't at least receive a C if you put in the effort.

    Great Professor, gives a midtermfinal exam study guide and tells you exactly what material willwill not be covered on the test. Homework is done online weekly along with a quiz, but they are pretty easy. Lectures are interesting and she explains everything in depth. Definitely recommend to those scared to take accounting.

    Joanna was amazing. I'm an accounting major and loved her! She explained things in depth if you didn't understand and you could email her about difficult hw problems and expect a reply within the hour or so. So helpful and really prepares you for the midterm and final. Take her if you get the chance! Amazing prof.

    Professor Dabrowska is awesome! Always takes time to answer any questions, gives great lecture notes and study guides, and will go over multiple examples until you get the material. Accounting is definitely not a blowoff class, but she makes it interesting and doable! Great professor overall!

    Great professor, one of my favorites at DePaul! I was scared to take accounting because I had to drop it at a previous university. She was very helpful and made sure you understood everything. She provides handouts and powerpoint slides. She made accounting enjoyable for me. I highly recommend her.

    she gives out really helpful handouts for every chapter. if you go over all the handouts before the midterm and final you will do fine. hw and quizzes are online. 8 quizzes, drops the lowest 3. you can take the quiz twice, she takes the higher grade. Overall easy class.
