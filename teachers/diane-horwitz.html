A lot of reading, a couple of 6-8 pg papers, three 2 pg papers, and that was it. Prof. H was pretty nice, sometimes she rambles on but we get back on track, but all in all I liked her and the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2012<br>Class Name: ENGENG<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Babels on about things that dont matter this week it was about grapes?  Is rude by constantly interrupting people and making fun of them if they disagree with her.  If you disagree with her she also will retaliate against your grade.  LItterly wrote on my paper WRONG OPINION and gave me a C.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2011<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Passionate and opinionated professor, who is open to hearing other world views and welcomes students' opinions. Don't be afraid to share in class. The reading material is well selected, albeit one sided- towards the liberal side. However, it is consistent w/DePaul's philosophy of urban/multicultural education. Great class overall!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2010<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like Dr. H. She and I probably took a little while to warm up to each other, but she was very helpful. I learned a lot in her class this past Spring. I had a little snafu regarding references and she was very kind, very patient.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2009<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very sweet and passionate lady. More work than other Elementary courses but managable. Participation in class is a must. She picks favorites</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2008<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful, expects you to participate in class discussions, so reading is critical. Group discussions first, then class discussions. No tests, just papers every week, and a project or a presentation. Final paper 7 pages, not hard at all. you can only miss one class, depends on schedule too. mine was 3 hours, so only one class missed allowed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2008<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very boring, she talks like she giving a bedtime story, very lost in class and very sleepy. needs to retire</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/04/2006<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have never had such a painful experience with a professor.  She jumps all over the place in her lectures and her reading assignments, gives her personal opinion WAY TO MUCH.  Very one sided in her views and is not open to alternative opinions.  Everything you fear about a liberal arts/education teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: SCU207<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Majority of class failed first few quizzes so she changed quizzes to written take home assignments. there was a 2 pg paper due every week. If you do the reading (not too bad)youll do fine. Lots of small group discussions.  I dont think there was 1 day that she lectured the whole 90minutes.  Final is 5pgs. and project or presentation.  Good prof!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Horwitz is very nice, but very flakey.  She jumps from one topic to the next w/o notice.  I never know what she's talking about in class.  The topics are interesting but she assigns more reading than could possibly be done.  She's good about helping you out though, and answers emails quickly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2006<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
