Grade is solely based on tests.  Would have preferred more relevant homework assignments to make the tests less of a surprise.  True, nothing you see on the test isn't anything that wasn't discussed in class, but you could also read the entire textbook and say the same thing.  Funny lectures and a very nice man.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2014<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved the class.

Get a good nights sleep, do some jumping jacks, and bring coffee/red bull to prepare for the intense 150 min. of complex lecture that the exams are entirely based on.    Within 24 hours review and add to your notes to make sure you understand all concepts. Don't need a the book.

The explanation during the class is not always clear. Mid-term and final are really tough,book is not helpful at all,only his lectures and handouts can help prepare. Class average was C. I'd better recommend someone else for this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/04/2011<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredible professor.  Only a midterm and final for grades, along with two short essays that he doesn't even read (automatic A's).  However, getting an A in the class is a chore if you don't truly listen and ask questions.  He doesn't teach out of the book, so don't bother buying it.  If you really want to learn, this is the guy for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the only class I ever received a B in during my MBA.  It was very hard. Good professor.  Keeps you the FULL amount of time every class. Tests are very hard.  He makes the class average approximately 80%. I was so happy when class was finished, however, I think I learned a lot. Would not take again because it hurt my GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough class but it was definitely worth it. You will never use the book except for chapter 4 and 7 (you can live without). You must attend every class and take notes as the tests will be on his lectures. He is the best professor I have ever had so far and I have learned more than any other class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2010<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Opiela is a great teacher. He challenges his students and at a graduate level this should be expected. He is good about explaining things, however, he does talk quite fast, so its hard to get everything down in lecture.  I would recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2010<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Let me just say that this is a very tough class, but that you are dealing with a very tough subject. That being said, Professor Opiela is the the best professor I have had in the MBA program. He is engaging, witty, and really funny. But, most of all, he is an excellent professor. He cares about the subject and his teaching style is excellent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2009<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good Prof.  The course is more difficult than others.

He keeps the class's attention because of his odd humor.  The first test was not difficult but the final was hard.

He explains the material very clearly, good examples and a great snes of humor. I am neary finished with my MBA and he is by far the best teacher in the program. However, this course requires a lot of work. This course is not an easy A like many others in the program.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely helpful and tries to explain material in laymen's terms.

Go see him in his office if you need help.  Think outside of the box when studying.  As long as you can practice switching his formulas around, you can master the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2008<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tim is not a very good professor.  He is unclear, has difficulty in getting his point across, and gets easily frustrated.  Several times during the course students had to come up with better analogies to help him with his explanation.  Being 75% through my MBA he is definitely a professor who scores in the bottom 10%.  AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very, very tough teacher.  Although tough, he has a lot of energy and makes GSB fun if you can believe it.  I hesitate to recommend b/c he makes the material more difficult than needed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2008<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough class, but at least he tries to make class interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class if Econ is your major. He digresses a lot. Exams are hard b/c you dont know what he is looking for.  Impossible to reach via email.  Usually a 2 week lag in response.  Personally I found it boring and hard to stay focused in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to learn econ this is the professor to take.  Yes he is hard, and his exams are challenging, but if you study his notes and lectures you should do well on his tests.  He has a strange sense of humor, but makes class interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy makes ECON class interesting...tough subject and tough tests, but you'll learn some great, applicable information that will help you understand what's happening in the economic & financial world around you. Suck it up and challenge yourself by taking Opiela, the education is well worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a difficult class. You have read before class to understand the lectures. I worked hard for my A, & learned a lot in class. No projects, just midterm, final, and homework( as long as you turn in something you get the 20%). I liked him and took him for ECO 509 as well. If you don't understand something he will explain until you get it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Time moves very slowly in this class; you never get out early and the professor makes it work by staring at his watch throughout lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2008<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smart guy who knows his economics.

Loved the material and sometimes ran a bit further down the road without us as a result, but made sure to swing back to pick us up.  Test questions demanded analytical thinking, not rote memorization.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is difficult, but you will do fine if you take good notes, read the book, and PRACTICE problems extensively. He writes LONG exams, and 80% of the final covered a very specific part of the book discussed only in the very last class. He does not take roll, but attend every class because if you miss something, you will fall behind.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is an extremely difficult class. I worked harder for a grade than ever before in this class, but if you do ALL the work required, you can do well. I would take this class again because I did walk away with a great deal of knowledge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof is extremely intelligent, but has difficulty explaining complex material. He's tough to track down outside of class and does not return calls or emails. His tests are tough and half of the material on the final exam was covered in the last 15 mintues of the previous class. I recommend him if you have a background in stats or calc.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2007<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor.

He is also willing to answer every single question students have until everyone gets it. His tests are difficult, but fair if you attend class and take good notes. I recommend him, definitely worthwhile.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2007<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests are tough, but his supplied notes with your notes from class help you to understand what is required for the Mid-term and Final. No quizzes, some homework is required but it is never looked and everyone gets full credit. Tests are hard (M/C,fill-in-blank,essay) but he makes a effort to make sure everyone understands the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher.  You can tell he is smart because of the way he explains concepts (e.g. show the derivation of a formula rather than just write it on the board).  The tests are not easy, but they are fair.  You have to work very hard because there is a LOT of material.  But if you do that, you will succeeed.  I would take another class of his.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smart, knows the material, and a nice guy who cares about the students but the class seemed to be unbearably disorganized at times.  Tests are moderately hard and quite lengthy.  Grades on a curve and allowed reweighting of the mid-term and final.  Would consider taking in the future even with the class lacking a structured approach at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2007<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a little quirky, has dry English type of humor.  Really knows his stuff, and makes sure that everyone understands the topics.  His tests can be really hard, but everything is straight from his notes.   Makes studying a little easier.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice guy and makes semi good jokes. Very knowledgable, but like many, cannot teach very well or too clearly. Expects you to know Econ at Master level, which is kind of uncalled for midlevel course. Overall, I would say to avoid him if you want easy grade, but take him if you're willing to work hard. You will actually learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2006<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really great class.  Not easy, but if you go to class and take lots of notes you will be ok.  The mid-term and final really do test your knowledge, but he is a fair grader.  I recommend taking his class if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2006<br>Class Name: ECO798<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a smart guy, explains clearly and he makes sure everybody understands his point. Gives several real life examples. He never responds to emails, so you have to contact him personally if you have questions. I recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: GSB450<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXTREMELY DIFFICULT exams but graded with a curve.  60% of final was covered in the last 10 minutes of the last class.

He is an amazing listener and does his best to ensure that the entire class understands the material.  He will put in the extra time with the students if necessary.

Fair grading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2004<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2004<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful.....very excited teaching style...this is not a boring ECON class..however, you MUST know everything for the tests..but the tests are fair (multi choice, fill-in-blank, essay)..one of the best classes I've ever taken..very effective teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2003<br>Class Name: ECON509<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Required class for some folks.
