The journals are a wreak, everything the speakers say is worthless in a paper. He doesn't discuss any of the papers he hands out at the end of class, making them impossible to understand, the book doesn't help. I don't know how he got a Ph. D. Poor teaching all around</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: EXPLOCHIC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible educator.
