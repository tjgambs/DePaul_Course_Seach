As long as you put the work in, and do what is expected of you, there's no reason that you can't do well. I highly recommend not only taking this class, but taking this professor. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2015<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Cheng is really great! His lectures are informative, clear, and relevant and I really enjoyed having him as a professor. That being said, this is a graduate level course, so be prepared to put some more effort into it than an undergraduate course. The students who complaindon't do well are the ones who don't apply themselves or pay attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2015<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Being my first online class, I was almost sure it would be my last. He assigned a ton of readings each week, and a quiz or two per week. The quizes answers can easily be googled, so the reading isn't always necessary. There's two huge papers at the end of the quarter that he gives very little feedback or info on, so that was a little stressful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2013<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Dr. Cheng! He's passionate about teaching and it's obvious that he cares about his students. You won't regret taking his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2013<br>Class Name: SCG406<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great online class.  Made the material interesting.  Supplemented with a lot of videos and articles.  Tons of reading, but not really required to participate or pass the class.  Vague due dates, but easy to clear up by asking.  Overall great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2012<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this professor, he is really excited to teach the information, the only thing I would warn against is he does have a really strong accent, but you do get used  to it after a little while, worth taking he is very sweet.</div></div></div></body></html>
