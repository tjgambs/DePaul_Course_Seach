    I agree that JoAnne can be a little confusing, but she definitely makes up for it with her willingness to help and her passion for the subject.  While there was a bit more work than your typical non-production DC class, this course was extremely valuable in developing my skills.  Plus any acting class is harder if you're shy...

    Working With Actors. Basically she is often unclear about what she wants, but if you do exactly what she tells you for your project and follow her &quot;suggestions&quot; you'll do fine.

    She's interesting to say the least, if you don't like getting up in front of class and acting out scenes this class isn't for you. She kinda puts you under the spot light but she is really nice and helpful with homework.
