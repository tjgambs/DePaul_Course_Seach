It was a 3 hr night class and it didn't help that he read from the PowerPoint the whole time. The tests are ridiculous even though he curves. Occasional mistakes in grading. Must attend class. I wish we would have done some in-class problems. You have to read the bookstudy on your own to pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2012<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely would not recommend. All he does is read directly from the book published powerpoints. Going to class is absolutely pointless but is required as part of your grade. Two research papers are required, but he doesn't even read them. What a waste of time. Midterm and final are ridiculously hard, but he does curve the midterm a lot. Nice guy, but not a good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material is hard and challenging but it is learnable. The professor reads off the power points and rarely, if ever, does any examples on the board. The professor is a little boring and seems to be occupied with things other than the class. Overall he is a nice guy and if you study enough you will receive an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT383<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is not easy; however, the teacher makes is possible to receive a good grade in class. Huge curve plus extra credit essay question on the exams. Attendance and research papers count, which help your grade. The teacher is very understanding! Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2011<br>Class Name: ACC201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hey his a nice guy and all but not such a great teacher... if he went over the hw and show how to do problems specifically he would be a good teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2011<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher lectures with powerpoints Attendance is taken 3 papers Midterm &  final There is a huge curve This class is not easy. It is either Foth or Jakalski The class can be confusing It is way more difficult than ACC 380 Just getting by is difficult given the difficulty & complexity of the rules. T/F M/C & strictly graded essay for exams</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2011<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough class, but HUGE curve on the midterm.

The final grade is based  on the mid-term and final exam.  There are two papers, one that is required (but worth 0 points) and one that is extra credit.  The syllabus is either wrong, outdated, or he was too busy during the semester to care.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2010<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Reads off of the powerpoint slides. too much material for the exams. coming to class is pointless</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2009<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked Professor Jakalski. He is very clear about the material he teaches and although the course had a lot of information his exams were given in a manner that wasn't overwhelming. He curves the exams and overall is a nice and knowledgeable guy.  I'd definitely recommend him for ACC 380!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Actually kind of liked this guy though my class consisted of all babies that cried about everything. He was very reasoinable and made it easier after the Mid-Term ave was a F. Dropped  lowest quiz score. Turn in HW. People, accounting can be hard but you won't be disappointed if you take this guy. I'd give him a 7/10. I got a B in the class.</div></div></div></body></html>
