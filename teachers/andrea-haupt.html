It helps you for the surprise quizzes. The midterm and final are in a similar format. I highly recommend the class. She really cares about her subject and knows a lot.

Shows films that go with the class. I recommend it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2009<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is extremely helpful, and very knowledgable about the material.  Also, if you talk to her after class or express interest in something that she covered she will suggest related readings that might interest you.  She was a great teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2009<br>Class Name: POLSC150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took 150 and thought it was a really cool class.  She really cared to make it interesting. When you listen carefully, you notice her dry sense of humor and she is very helpful when you talk to her. I did not like the surprise quizzes, but they did make me read more.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2009<br>Class Name: PSC250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was challenging but I did learn a lot from it. She expects A LOT from the students. Make sure you do the readings and review for the midterm and final. She is very nice, I didn't find her super helpful though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2009<br>Class Name: PSC250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Western European Politics with her and learned a lot, but the class was very difficult. There is a lot of reading and you have to do ALL of it in order to do well on tests. She is very nice and will help outside of class if you need it. However, make sure your other classes aren't too demanding because hers will take up lots of your time!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: PSC250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Alot of kids didnt like her or her  teaching style. i thought she was good and enthusiastic. Its her first year and our class didnt participate at all so it was really our fault</div></div></div></body></html>
