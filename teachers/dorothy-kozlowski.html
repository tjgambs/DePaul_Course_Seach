DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. She goes over everything you need to know in detail and does not assign anything from the book. I waste 200$ :( She is very clear and also willing to meet for office hours. Super smart lady and answers questions based on her wealth of knowledge! Would love to take again! Do not miss class </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2014<br>Class Name: BIO440<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really good with explaining concepts.

I really love her course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2007<br>Class Name: BIO340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is open to suggestions and really tries to base the class on what we (students) want to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2006<br>Class Name: BIO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a great system of teaching the class, it is very direct and the homework is easy to follow from the notes. The exams follow the homework and class lectures exactly, so it is very easy to understand. The tests are long but not too difficult. She is very easy going and a nice lady!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/26/2005<br>Class Name: BIO305<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a very organized and direct approach to the class.  Closely follows the text so you don't really have to attend but I would recommend it if you are not familiar with computer stats programs as she gives helpful hints.  Overall a good prof but I dont think math is her strong suit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: CELLNEURO<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Study the steps and lists in your lecture notes and you'll do well on the tests. Very clear lectures and doesn't mind questions. However, if you go to her for help outside of class she seems irritated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2004<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy class.. .all class discussion.
