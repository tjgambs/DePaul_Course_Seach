    Extremely nice guy. He runs a very laid back class. At least for my class, he has a ridiculous grade margin, giving A's all the way to 85%, and B's all the way down to 70%. Very fun, and a good speaker.

    He is a soft-spoken, extremely pleasant guy. But he has an obsession with health that students may not hold. He expects a research paper to be written before one's taken research methods. But he will provide A LOT of help if sought.
