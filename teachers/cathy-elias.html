    Great class for people who like the Beatles. You have to learn some music theory but she is always willing to help. Fun class; teacher knows a lot.

    She knows a lot about The Beatles but the articles for the presentation you have to do suck! They're really really hard to understand . Also, most of the students taking this class are MUSIC MAJORS. As a Marketing major I felt as if I was being JUDGED ALL THE TIME by the professor and the students when I didn't know music terminology or theory.

    Cathy knew what she was talking about and did her best to address everything about the Beatles. She was a great teacher and I enjoyed the class a lot.

    Dr. Elias is an amazing professor. She definitely will get mad at you if you don't have your stuff prepared and done but it's motivational. Everything she does is relevant to the tests and she really tries to help everyone out as much as she can. If you make an effort to do well in her class, she will make sure you do well.

    Very scary woman, I love her to death though. She yells a lot at kids who don't know their stuff, so come to class prepared. Second quarter gets a lot more difficult and she really piles on homework, but none of it is busy work - it is ALL useful. As a teacher, she can be intimidating, but is really very nice if you show real interest in class.

    What an awesome woman! She's so smart and full of stories. I think some of us could have been challenged a bit more, though. First year musicianship was extremely easy.

    She is a very nice lady her classes are interesting because she is very knowledgeable about the Beatles.  However she does not realize that not everyone is a music major espeically in the Loop and she explains music theory verrrry fast.  Has way too many books to read (6) She should pick 1 not 6.

    This lady rocks my world. She's absolutely one of the coolest people I've ever met. Not only does she know absolutely everything about the subject, but she's really passionate about it. Ask her about her experiences at The Julliard School sometime...her stories are *hilarious*!

    She's so smart and helpful.  She works really hard to make sure you understand the theory and history and prepares you very well for the tests.  Also has the best stories about her juvenile delinquency at juliard prep and in college.  Shes hilarious.

    She is so intelligent and a great teacher.  She really prepares first year students for the following years. I hear that she is really hard on grad students, but I was an undergrad when I had her.
