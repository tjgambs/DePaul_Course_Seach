His grading is very simple and somewhat easy. All in all though, he's a good guy who engages the class and can be funny at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2011<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Scott Young is one of the best teachers at DePaul. Just go to class, read the book before each quiz and you should get an A. He is very knowledgeable and you can learn a lot just by attending class. 3 quizzes all of them with good curve. I wish I took him for MGT 300.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class.
