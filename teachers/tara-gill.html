    Great prof! Provided clear objectives and expectations. Made herself available for extra help. Very knowledgable of topic/research area. Great discussions. Challenges you to put forth your very best which can be difficult, but totally worth the effort in the end!

    Perhaps Tara got her act together, b/c she never missed class and if late, only one or two minutes. She is very nice and outgoing. She allowed there to be open discussion (basically the class went where ever we took it). The work load is not extremely heavy (midterm--no final, two 1-3 pg summaries, 1 pg proposal, 6-12pg final paper, and readings).

    Tara is great! I don't know what these people are talking about, she cancelled one class the whole quarter, she knows a lot and she is very helpful with anything you need help with. This class was amazing, I learned a lot and I really don't understand what all these people are talking about...

    This professor is the WORST I have ever had in over 4 years of college. A HUGE waste of my time and money. Grading is very unfair... a paper receives a &quot;great&quot; accompanied by a 22/25 with no other comments. The teacher is unavailable and very unhelpful outside of class. Awful!!!!!

    I was really excited to take this course until I noticed her pattern of not attending class at least 9 times. She was not interested in teaching which was obvious and she was unclear what she really expected out of us. I recommend she never teach unless she is monitored by a senior professor.

    Easy as hell.She missed more classes then I did.Arbitrary grader,when she got around to it. (ie; &quot;great paper! 21/25&quot; !&#63;)Boring,boring material.powerpoints were useless.She was a nice enough lady,just NOT interested in being a teacher.I'd be surprised if she teaches again,totally unprofessional.

    Good class to take if you want to waste your money.  She missed class 9x and didn't seem to care about teaching us, only about earning her PhD- didn't seem too worried about the class that we were each paying over $4000 for.  HUGE waste of time &amp; money-the class was worthless and bored me to tears.
