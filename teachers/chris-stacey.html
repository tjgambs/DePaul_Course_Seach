He is so understanding when it comes to assignments. If you need an extension all you have to do is ask, no reasons at all. The midterm and final were both three essay questions, but you get the questions before hand and they are super easy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2015<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>Stacey was a good lecturer and he kept class interesting, but he taught the class as if it was a 300 level. I took 376 (Post-War America) the year after with Dr. Doody, and she was a MUCH easier grader than Stacey was, and the class had a comparable workload!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Stacey is one of my favorite professors at DePaul. There is a lot of reading, a lot of notes and a lot of listening but I have learned more in his class than I would have ever excepted. He makes history very relevant by always connecting it back to the "So What?". He is VERY clear as to what you need to know for exams. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2014<br>Class Name: HST240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are interested in Chicago History you will love this course. Do the readings as much as possible and come to class and pay attention and it will be a fun and easy class for you. Final and midterm are take-home essays. One project. He is a great lecturer but can sometimes lose his temper so be prepared for that. Overall, highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2014<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You spend class mindlessly taking copious amounts of notes. The midterm and final consist of memorizing as much info as you can for 4 essay questions, but be prepared for 6 or 8, since you don't know what 4 he will ask. After midterm, we read a book, discussed in class, then wrote 8 page paper on. He's a nice guy though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2013<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Stacey really wants every student to do well and doesn't give below a C for completed work. Really flexible with extensions and an overall nice guy. Don't come to his class and not pay attention because he'll just stop class and stare at you. Try to keep up with the reading, it will make exams so much easier.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not a bad professor just extremely boring and at the end for midterms or finals you feel like you're losing your mind because THERE IS TOO MUCH INFORMATION TO BE COVERED. Plus the class information is a snooze anyway.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2013<br>Class Name: HIST183<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE is a great professor makes things very clear. His lectures are very boring and you want to fall asleep.  Upside you dont have to read because he answers all of the questions for you in class you watch 3 movies and write 2 papers. The midterm and final are essay based and he gives you the questions participate a little for good grade!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: LSP250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really nice guy but a really tough grader. He is one of those teachers who is extremely smart, which makes it hard for someone with little knowledge of the subject to understand what he's talking about sometimes. Classes are entirely discussion and sometimes videos, but the readings are LONG and there are A LOT of them. Also many papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2011<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>boring and tedious. assignments take ages, and any missed requirements carry irrationally heavy consequences. missing page requirements by a couple lines might leave you with a failing mark and might not even be counted in the final grade. all in all, a lot of work that goes unrewarded. is not as knowledgeable as he leads on to be.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2010<br>Class Name: HST183<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems like a nice, laid back guy.  He was extremely friendly to our class.  I really liked the format, reading and discussing the chapter openly and then watching a movie from each decade.  It made me much more interested to participate with such an open discussion.  2 take home exams that are actually very involved and quite difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2009<br>Class Name: HST182<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>B-O-R-I-N-G.  He talks the whole class and all you do is read articles that are at least 25 pgs long. I think he purposely looks for long boring articles. There's quizzes on them every couple weeks but they're take-home.  I never read and do the quizzes the night before.  Participation is a big deal to him, but he won't make you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2009<br>Class Name: HIST182<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems a bit rough around the edges, but he is a nice guy.  He really wants class participation, and it's hard to do that because many of the readings are long and boring.  No tests, just 3 papers based-off readings.  Try and skim through the readings(30 pages or more) so you have a general idea of what they are about so you can participate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2007<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher and likes for students to participate. You watch movies and read a few books. Take good notes and do the assignments because they all build your grade up. The mid-term and final are long but he gives you time to do the different assignments. The class as ok. i got a B and i was late everydayI got a c on the mid and a on final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2006<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not that bad.  It could of been better but I've had worse. Just do the work and you will be fine. Got a B+ in the class but I did work for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't like the books we read and was bored in every class. He is an easy grader but not a very good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I could agree with everone here. I worked really hard in his class but I got a B because he was very willing to spend time to help other students as long as they cared. As a lecturer he is not the best, but was a class to look at American Hist in a different way. Didn't learn much I think he is O.K</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a jerk. I did not like him at all, he does not respect students in any way. I would avoid him at all cost. You have to memorize movies and readings, just for the quiz. Which there are 3 of. A final exam, and a research paper. AVOID HIM</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: HIST282<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is a person, but he is very picky & seems to be rough around the edges(you can tell he was one of those kids in highschool who got picked on alot and now he seems very bitter).Once again he is a nice teacher and is very open to helping his students. Just expected too much and was hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2005<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His class seemed like it was in week 1 the whole freaking time. There are lectures that teach you something but he offers no lec notes or outline to follow. Jumps around a lot and gets pissed off over petty****. If you tend to be late, don't take him. He's like a h.s. teacher in that respect.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wosrt teacher ever. Avoid him because he is a liberal pain that knows nothing about American History. Expects too much from a student because Bush is still in office. Be forwarned and do not go near this class at all costs. Who needs history when you have a teacher like him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What are you guys talking about!&#63; Sure the material is hard but history is hard in gen. This professor is awesome. Extremely helpful & always available for his students. He's so compassionate & understanding with situations. He'll even help with recommendation letters. A+ with his dedication.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2005<br>Class Name: HST282<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst teacher I have ever had. When I was sitting in his class, I felt like nothing I ever did was good enough for him. Way too much reading and writing, I felt like I was in an english class more than a history class. Don't take him, avoid him at all costs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2005<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>avoid him. he's the hardest grader i've ever seen.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2005<br>Class Name: HST350<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so hard.  Half the class failed.  I'm a student who gets straight A's and he gave me a c-.  His quizzes are worth 100 points each and each time he has to curve it because it's so hard and you still end up with a c.  The final is ten pages.  We have four books and we have to read two other ones</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2005<br>Class Name: HST<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I do not like this professor at all. He does not do anything in class that is relevant to our hw.
