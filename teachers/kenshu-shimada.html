He is the best professor I've ever had!  Words cannot describe how great of a professor he is.  Always making jokes during class, so lectures are never boring.  He loves his sharks and children, always talking about them.  You would not regret taking his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2015<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: Rather not say</div><div id="right"><div>professor Shimada is a good professor. he's hilarious! I was never bored in his lectures. He gives specific examples. He doesn't give study guide but all you gotta do is go to class, write down important details in his lecture, review it again and again and you'll be fine. i recommend Dr. Shimada to anyone, seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2014<br>Class Name: ENV116<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shimada and enthusiasm go hand in hand. There were many boring days, but other days he'd bring in rocks for us to "examine" and it'd be fun. The class was overall easy. I got C's on all three tests and still pulled off a B. It's important to memorize all the written sections and lists off his study guides too; those are asked for on the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2014<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Shimada is easily the most enthusiastic professor I have had. He stresses the importance of concepts over facts which makes what he teaches useful and applicable to real life.He is always willing to explain and meet with students outside of class. Definitely a favorite amongst DePaul students!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2013<br>Class Name: BIO122<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shimada is the most enthusiastic aprof I've ever had! Yells out GOOD MORNING each day when entering class. There are 3 exams, and about 6 projects, including a mandatory Field Museum visit and report and a poster project. Accent isn't a problem and the subject is very interesting. I'd recommend for Scientific Inquary Non-Lab Learning Domain.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2013<br>Class Name: BIO192<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Shimada is an excellent prof and ridiculously smart. He comes to every lecture with enthusiasm and energy. Tests were based on concepts, not memorization of random facts so if you read the book youll do fine. Can definitely ramble and get on tangents if you let him. Take if you want a thorough understanding of evolution</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2012<br>Class Name: ENV115<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are not a science person I would stay away from this class. I took it as my learning domain with lab and did not do so good. If you are bad at memorizing then this is not the class for you. Tests are very and very tricky as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Shimada was an excellent professor. He lecture was fun and interesting. He shows a lot of videos which are usually pretty cool. His tests can be difficult, but as long as you pay attention in lecture you can usually do pretty well on the tests. Take copious notes, attend lecture, and use the textbook only for clarification. Great Class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Shimada is enthusiastic about biology. His energy and humor keep class interesting. His lectures cover the most important points from our ultra-dense text. The only way you'll have trouble is if you do not attend or do not pay attention during lecture. Take notes, study them, and you'll do well. His &quot;Good Morning!&quot; shouts are NOT annoying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All around good professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Shimada has been one of the best professors I have ever had.  This was the first bio class I have taken and he was extremely easy to follow.  His notes were to the point and I really liked that the tests followed the notes rather than the book.  I also really enjoyed his classes.  He was funny and was overall a fantastic teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am not sure about the previous user's comment. I compared my lecture notes to the topics listed in the syllabus and they match exactly. He may have fallen behind, but everything was covered. That may be difficult for someone who was not showing up to class, but that's another problem all together. Great Prof, just make it to his lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not quite sure how others can give Shimada high marks.  He deviated from the syllabus constantly (infact, not covering chunks of it), often distracted himself from the material and was totally incomprehensible at times.  The films, while interesting, did not adequately address the material that he chose not to teach.  Awful teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very passionate and helpful professor. Lectures are clear and concise. Willing to spend extra time with students whose interest in the material is beyond the class. Integrates video to help explain complex concepts. Must attend class! Tests require an understanding of the material, not just regurgitating facts. Did not deviate from syllabus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Shimada was a great teacher! It was a pleasure learning about a topic that Dr.Shimada knew so much about. His movies enhanced the material covered in class. If you are willing to work, like any other class, you will succeed in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Where to begin.  This guy should be teaching third grade, not at the college level.  His lectures were spastic and his teaching was severely hampered by constant interruptions and obtuse movie clips.  Plus, enough with praising your own work! I would stay away if you actually want to learn anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Shimada really enjoys teaching the topics at hand.  He is very straight forward in what he expects from students.  It is not impossible to receive an A in the class if you attend and TRY. His tests are based off the notes.  He is FAR from incomprehensible and is very clear in his expectations. He is my favorite biology teacher thus far at depau</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Shimada is a good professor and is always upbeat and comes to class everyday with enthusiasm and a positive attitude.  While you can't get an A by being lazy, you can definitely get an A if you attend all the lectures, take notes, and study your notes for the tests.  If you didn't do well in this class, don't blame Dr. Shimada--he clearly state</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Shimada is quirky but in a really good way. How many lectures have you snored through b/c of a boring professor&#63; Dr. Shimada doesn't let that happen, and I actually learned. Tests are based heavily on notes, which he CLEARLY states at the beginning of the quarter.. it's really a matter of having consistent attendance and not being lazy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incomprehensible teacher.  His classes are a bore and he gets off track almost every period.  Hardly covered the material intended.  Book is useless on his tests and his wording, often incorrect and tricky.  In my major and I will never take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is awful!  He treated us like we were children, couldn't keep focused on one topic to actually teach it, and seemed more interested in sharing about his own research than teaching the course.  Would not recommend to anyone, stay away!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don' think Dr. Shimada is easy, but he's not impossible. He doesn't use the textbook so his tests are based off his notes. He is very enthusiastic about his class and research. He isn't an easy A but if you study and go to class then it shouldn't be too difficult.  I would definitely recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2010<br>Class Name: BIO102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't listen to any of these comments!

His class is super easy, do not need a book, tests are based solely on class notes so attendance is very important, but not necessarily mandatory. Likes to show videos in class, which are really interesting.

He's also slow-paced. His tests are based ONLY on lecture, so the book is ENTIRELY useless. Tests aren't too difficult, but he likes to be tricky with words. I don't recommend him. I was always VERY bored in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2009<br>Class Name: ISP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>KENSHU!!  I took him for my Explore Chicago class.  It was the easiest class ever.  We went on interesting field trips. The hardest assignment was writing a paper about a leaf.

I can honestly say he was never a bore.  His tests are challenging, but he ocassionally curves them (don't rely on that though). Very knowledgeable and interesting.
