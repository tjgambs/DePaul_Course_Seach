If liberal arts weren't required by the university he wouldn't even have a job, so I don't know where he gets off assigning 8 page papers and 9 hours of lecture per week. He completely ignores emails.

Much. Work. There's quizzes, papers, discussion posts, voice threads, and lectures (that are typically an hour each). It felt like considerably more work than an in-person class. He is good though in that he gets that not everyone "gets" philosophy, so he doesn't hold that against you with grading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: ONLINEPHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bob Vallier's intro philosophy course was one of the most intellectually engaging courses I have taken at DePaul. If you want to learn how to think, take his classes. And yes, the lectures were long, and he admits that. However, if one does the work, one gets an A and learns how to critically think about this mess we call life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2014<br>Class Name: PHL101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Long winded as can be. The typical lectures for the week were about 4 to 5 hours and he just rambles. However it is a very easy class if you can sit there and listen for 5 hours. Three papers make up a large amount of the class and they are easy to get A's and B's on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2014<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures were about 1 hour each for a total of 4-5 in each module. 5 modules in total for the quarter. He was very detailed and very helpful. He gave people A LOT of extra time to complete the course work and even extended datelines numerous amounts of time. Just put some time and effort and you will pass. His lectures are based on the readings</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2014<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Favorite course!

Prof Bob's lectures were sometimes long, but always engaging, funny, and made you think.  i learned ALOT!!

Best DePaul class I've taken. I love Bob! Yes, he's intimidating, but you'll get over that the first week. I learned so much in his class & I was actually sad it was over! He's super knowledgeable and conveys the course material in a very easy to understand manner. I wish I had room in my schedule to take another one of his classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: HON301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An outstanding and brilliant prof. Sarcastic, hilarious, but also arrogant and prissy. He's intimidating at first, but his mastery of the material and ability to communicate it make his lectures utterly facinating and riveting. I can't wait to take another class with him! He demands a lot, but I learned SO MUCH from his course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2009<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Vulgar, inappropriate, cynical, intimidating, sarcastic, pretentious-- and probably my favorite teacher I've ever had. He scared the hell out of me at first; now, I can't wait to take him again in the future. If you have brain cells, I recommend his classes. If not, steer clear and save yourself the trip crying to mommy that teacher picked on you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2008<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really don't see what this guy is so salty about he strikes me as fairly priviledged (though I guess that's part of his &quot;thing&quot;). He teaches a fairly self-indulgent class and doesn't hide contempt very well but it's easy enough to get by.  I really can't recommend him as I feel that the chip he has on his shoulder is simply too much to deal with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2008<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is brilliant. His class stands out as the most enjoyable I had this year. Being a philosophy course, the material is extremely dense, but very rewarding when you begin to garner a real understanding of what Vallier and the authors are saying. Don't miss a chance to take this guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2007<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>amazing professor and the second time i have taken him. hilarious , cynical, self-deprecating. just as someone else wrote, he makes the stupid people shut up. its great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2007<br>Class Name: HON105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Um, I think I am in love with Bob.  Sassy, hilarious, ridiculous, really smart.  Brought us dough nuts the day after Nietzsche's birthday.

The result is one where the students who pay to learn from a teacher, actually do what they pay to do: learn from the teacher. also, he is hilarious and entertaining and cynical.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2006<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting to say the least.

The work is demanding as well, but it's college and philosphical issues affect every topic. So instead of complaing try and understand what's going on. He's okay with you disagreeing, and will respect it as long as you're respectful as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My class was about the US consitution.  However, Vallier turned the class into a class on gay rights, which can be seen as a constitutional issue.  Vallier, however, turned the class into a philosophical exploration of homosexuality. This class was like an african american teacher turning a world history class into a civil rights class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2005<br>Class Name: PHILOFART<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wanted to weigh in on bob-- he teaches at columbia too.

He is a little harsh at first. But once you are in the class for a few wks u realize not to take him so seriously. Read like crazy and participate somehow in lectures, even if he shoots you down.

I'd take him again, just not at night.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you take him, you will have to work for your grade!
