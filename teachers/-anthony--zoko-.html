Tough grader, will take off points for anything. He will catch you plagiarizing or cheating. Exams are take home but they are hard. there are about 7 programming assignments. Maybe the first 2 are ok it gets rough after that.  If you don,t like programming don't take him.  He does email back fast.</div></div></div></body></html>
