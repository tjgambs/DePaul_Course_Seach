Some what difficult to understand, and has a weird sense of humor.  Still doable, just have to study hard for the midterm and final; gotta know how to do the main problem (she'll tell you) and key terms (strong v. weak dollar,  bid-ask, arbitrage, etc.)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2014<br>Class Name: 340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can't read her hand writing at all. Good luck you will need it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2014<br>Class Name: FIN557<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Would recommend this professor, great class. This professor mumbles sometimes, however, she is a great professor that knows a lot of the finance topics she teaches. she is also involved with the financial world outside the classroom and that really helps when she has examples.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2012<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's fast...you'll learn to keep up.  Her exams are difficult; stick to the study sheet; it's mainly on in class notes not outside readings.  She is an educator by trade (no outside corporate experience as far as I am aware) so there are no outside "experience" examples that assist in inspiring students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2011<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She will fill the board sloppily with acronyms assuming you know them.  She is extremely fast.  She's one of those teachers that likes to put everything out on the board, but won't take the effort to make sure her students are comprehending the material.  The midterm in my class wasn't curved.  She doesn't care to teach well at all! Don't take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2010<br>Class Name: FIN557<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very pleasant lady in class, goes fast through the material but explains it all if you concentrate and listen.reading the handout and book chapters b4 class helps follow her lectures.medium work required.generous/fair grader.DON'T TRUST THE BAD REVIEWS ABT HER!I was reluctant to take her b/c of that, but I am happy I did.SO TAKE HER!u won't regret!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yea she does go a little fast but she's a good teacher. If you don't understand something just ask her. This is not high school. She's a nice lady. I recommend her. She grades on a curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2009<br>Class Name: IB530<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most informing and educational classes I have taken at DePaul. Her assignments are difficult and time consuming, but make you learn the subject. It can be difficult to follow her train of thought and even harder to follow her notes. Overall, very educational and enjoyable class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2009<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher they have!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All you have to do is read the textbook and do the practice problems. Gives a healthy curve too. She moves quickly and makes alot of funny jokes in class; one of the friendliest prof. at Depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2007<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an average professor at best.  I have to agree with the last two comments!  The tests are not hard but no one really feels like showing up to class.  If I had a chance to do it all over again I probably would not have enrolled in her class, even though I did well last quarter:)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2007<br>Class Name: FIN2034<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a weird and mean lady!!!  The tests were not that hard but her lectures are very confusing&#63;&#63;....  She talks so fast and goes over a lot of material that no one understands.  Because of her I seriousaly felt like I was in LOONEYVILLE every tues and thurs.  NOT RECOMMENDED</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2006<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everyone says she is the best for intl fin.  I don't see why. She talks a mile a minute goes off on topics, can't follow at all.  Then tests us on everything.  We went so fast throught the quarter we were done a week ahead of schedule.  way way to fast, don't take if you want to learn about intl finance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor, knows her material. Tries to make class fun and keep people involved.  Like other said, she does move fast, but I wouldnt avoid taking her soley on that reason.  It was a very informative class.  We were at CME for like 7 of the sessions and did currency trading simulation. final harder than midterm</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>firecracker indeed! i personally kept losing focus on her lectures because she was going too fast, but her blackboard lecture outlines and postings helped me catch up and prepare for tests. most of the test material is taken from there. tests are hard but she grades fairly (huge curve). great person, i would recommend taking her for fin 340.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talks fast and is all over the dry erase board.  The tests are hard but have a huge curve.  I scored in the 70's on my midterm and it was a high B</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm surprised there's not many ratings for her. She does speak very fast, but the material is not too bad. Just study the material she posts on blackboard and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whoa what a firecracker! class was a challenge I'd have to admit, the material was not the easiest to grasp right away. you will need to study for sure. however grading was extremely fair, overall great experience! she is also very nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't listen to the person below. The Prof talks too fast, writes crappy, and her tests are hard. Avoid her if you can, if not, its not THAT horrible of an experience, but not recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2004<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice professor. However, her handwriting is very bad and she speaks very fast. I would recommend you to bring a recorder with you.</div></div></div></body></html>
