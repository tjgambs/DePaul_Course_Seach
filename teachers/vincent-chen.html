Not very helpful. I would not recommend this class unless you can teach yourself and you're already good at math.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy prof. You need to be able to learn on your own in order to pass his class. He does have a pretty thick Asian accent so many people had trouble figuring out what he was saying. He was an easy grader and the people in the lab helped out a lot. I would say take him if you want an easy grade depending on the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very nice, however, he is very difficult to understand. I find him to be a little impatient when you don't understand something though, and then both of you get frustrated because of the whole language issue. Definitley do not take this as a night class. He takes attendence, and you have a math project/presentation due at the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2006<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have told he is a very good teacher and have found it is true. :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2006<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think professor chen is a really nice person.

He is a nice enough guy, except that he insists following EVERYSINGLE LA&S guideline. He will not let you work ahead or leave early. He insists you stay for the full class period even if you are done.The material is easy, though he does not make his grading criteria clear in any way. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Chen was quite easily the worst teacher I have had, not just at DePaul, but ever. He has no idea how to run a class, is completely vague an unclear on the expectations and requirements of assignemnts (yet has no problem giving you whatever grade he feels like) and does draconian nonsense in teh name of classroom mangement.</div></div></div></body></html>
