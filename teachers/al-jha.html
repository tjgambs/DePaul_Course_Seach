Instructor did not clearly define concepts or expectations for assignments.  Feedback on final project was destructive and inflammatory.  The final exam was vague and logically flawed.   </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2013<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a great class, I learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2011<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Al is a great professor! He tells you what you need to know and not just a bunch of garbage. The workload is standard for all sections, but he is very helpful throughout. Mgt Sum's were tedious to complete but incredibly helpful. His goal is to make you a great mgr, and I will def be using things learned in his class in the real world. Highly rec!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2010<br>Class Name: IT333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Professor, He is a great teacher who has real life experience.

The complexity was good practice for the real thing.  Opportunity to learn the most came from the technical presentations and the case studies.  The online discussions, new technology and textbook were secondary.  My interest level in IT has increased significantly after taking this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2009<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great style of teaching that really engages students and spurs discussion. He truly cares about your understanding of the material and how you can apply it to your specific situation. He was a bit hamstrung by the format of the class, but did a great job getting the most important topics covered in detail. I would take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2008<br>Class Name: MIS555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of the most dreaded courses in the MBA program, but Al made this class enjoyable.
