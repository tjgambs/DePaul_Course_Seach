I have learned absolutely nothing in this course.  All he does it put in a pointless movie that is not marketing related and he leaves the room for an hour or so.  This class is very boring and he is an awful teacher, but unfortunately he is the only teacher is offered for this class at this time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2007<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I only took this guy because he is the only one teaching it at the time. the man is a reck, probably has no idea what is going on, if he did he would probably help us and get a better grade but easy just do the work and presentation make sure your gourp is devoted too. you will do fine if you at least rry.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2007<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class, nice professor. Just show up because he takes attendance and do your grop project. Midterm and Final are take homes but require input. Easy going class just boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2007<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2006<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found this class relatively easy. Classes consited of class presentations and videos literally every class. Mid-term & Final were straight forward and easy. Only took roughly 2-3 hours to do. Everything is group based. Just show up to class, dont leave early and show interest. Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2006<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is hard. The mid term and final are take home but make sure you work hard on it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2006<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a terrible class.  He is boring and unclear, but the class is easy.  Turn in the cases, show up to class, and do the midterm/final as a group andn you'll get a B+.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2006<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i don't have to wait till the semester is over to say that this guy should retire. yes, he does have a lot of experience, but he is not good at teachning. so far i haven't learnt a single thing! most cases are not that easy at all (require some financial analysis), and he's doing nothing to make them more &quot;accessible&quot;. waste of time and money!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2006<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!! I don't understand why he is still teaching!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2006<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Potentially could be a tough class if you dont work with another knowledgable students. one could get away without buying the textbook and pass the class. However, not having the text is annoying to others. If ya want to share textbooks, ya should pay for half my s**t.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to get something from this class and have other professor teaching it, omit Walsh. You will not learn anything. Basically what he does while discussing the cases is reading from transparencies. There are 4 quizzes and he drops the lowest one. They are from chapters but other than that and the cases you do not need the book. Simply copy </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2006<br>Class Name: MKT359370<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>these classes are the s*** very easy make some friend in the class and have them sign you in all the test are take home and the presentation may require a bit of work but its worth it for doing nothin all quarter</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2006<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yea i'm sitting in class right now and he's been reading an article to us for about 20 minutes about nintendo, this class is ridiculous, if you wanna learn absolutely nothing, then by all means take this class, you will do a presentation, a midterm and a final, i don't think he even looks at the homework</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Walsh is a great professor.  Stick with the class - all you have to do is a presentation, take home midterm and take home final!  He is a great guy if you give him a chance.  The class is worth it!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This course caused me so much unneccessary stress. Walsh grades us on criteria we have no experience on and fails to explain his expectations of the class. It is downright ridiculous. This was by far the worst class I've taken from the mkt dept. If there is a way to take this over the summer with another prof, by all means, do it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2005<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Walsh teaches an interesting course. Understand, however, that it is a case-study course. It is not nearly as bad as everyone else is saying. You do learn about some cool 'strategies' and other things. Bottom line, Take Walsh, don't drop after 1 week, give it some time before you decide.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2005<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class should be a great class, his method of &quot;teaching&quot; makes it seem ridiculous. Case write-ups are easy, once you figure out the expectations. Feedback is often too generic and not relevant on presentations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Listen, this was perhaps the most painful course I have ever had to endure in my undergrad. The bore facotr, as I call it, is ten-fold any other professor. I mean really, he sleeps during class, is always late, and lets you leave after an hour. This is a case study class you'll need later, WAKE UP!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2005<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Man, I cannot stress this enough...... Don't take this guys class (unless you don't care about learning!)  His teaching skills are poor as hell! I agree that he uses material outdated by 40 years.  And he can't even tell you his name without boring you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a waste of time and money.  Learned nothing; he doesn't even TEACH, he just pops in a video and sits there and tries to stay awake.  He needs to retire like yesterday.  If any other teachers are available for this class, it is in your best interest to avoid Walsh.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE IS AN OK GUY THAT WANTS THE CLASS TO GET SOME REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE. HIS TEACHING EFFECTIVENESS IS AVERAGE AND THE MATERIAL IS A LITTLE BLAND.THE CLASS CONSISTS OF BUSINESS CASES ONLY.HE COULD BE OK IF PEOPLE TOOK HIM SERIOUSLY. I DID THE CASES BEFORE CLASS AND IT SEEMS HE DOESNT EVEN GRADE THEM.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You've got to be kidding!  How the hell did this guy get his job&#63;  Not only does he fall asleep in class, but he assigns case studies/homework from the 70's, and gives pop quizzes based on things he never bothered to cover.  Also, he tends to have difficulty reading ppt slides, and marks off for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: MARKETING<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE IS REALLY GOOD! WE HAD HIM WINTER QUARTER. VERY EASY.GOOD LECTURES.MIN.WORK NEEDED.TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS TEST RULE HE GIVES YOU 100 questions & u CHERRY PICK (IN HIS OWN WORDS) THE EASYIEST. SO BASICALLY YOU STUDY THE CHAPTERS YOU WANT. THE BOOK IS REALLY GOOD TO IT COMES WITH C.D.'S to listen to</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN! YOU WILL LEARN NOTHING! If you just want a good grade, then take him, but if you actually want to learn something then don't. Only prof at DePaul who FALLS ASLEEP when he plays videos for us. Group project plus the midterm is takehome and can be done as a group. You choose.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2005<br>Class Name: MKT370<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Walsh is fine, but the personal selling clas doesn't offer much. If you want a good grade take this class, but if you want to learn something take another class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2004<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I concur with the previous comments. This guy really blows...i mean, he sleeps during student presentations, consistently late to class, and has displayed a complete lack of enthusiasm for subject matter. Just another useless professor DePaul has decided to keep.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2004<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG. Prof.Walsh needs to retire. I seriously thought he was going to choke more than once AFTER falling asleep during our presentation. Easy class but REALLY REALLY REALLY (i can't overemphasize the bore factor enough) class.</div></div></div></body></html>
