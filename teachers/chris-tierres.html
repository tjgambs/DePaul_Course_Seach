Agree completely.  Class ended up as a generic REL class as opposed to afterlife.   You cover Aztec, Christianity, and Islam...that's it.  Then the class is much harder than other generic REL classes here. Prepare to have your privilege checked.  Fake being interested in specific religion for grade bump!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2011<br>Class Name: REL257<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, here is the deal. This class is HARD. There is so much work it is hard to breath sometimes and you usually want to cry. BUT Prof. T. is an amazing guy. He loves his job, he loves his student and he made me love the class. There is a lot of reading and if you don't have time, don't take the class. I think it is an amazing class though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2009<br>Class Name: REL113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay, so heres the deal, I took Tirres 2009. He's pretty hot and has a fun personality. He doesnt put you to sleep with his voice or anything and the movie clips he shows are really interesting. I don't think I'd ever take a class with him again. He gives a lot of reading and doesnt really clarify any of them. Youre left to figure it out 4 urself</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2008<br>Class Name: REL113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not easy but soooo worth it! Prof. Tirres is awsome! You learn so much and the readings are very interesting. Do not buy the readings from the bookstore, it is so overprized! Print them up and make your own binder. A class worth taking!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2008<br>Class Name: REL132<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very understanding and passionate about religion. Very knowledgeable, never did he push his opinions. Actually he never mentioned them. He does require a lot of readings and summaries, but if you do them, you'll definately pass the midterm. He's a cute guy willing to help you out. Plus, he make class very interesting and fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2008<br>Class Name: REL257<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not about death and its beyond!!!I am an A student...but please read!!! Mr. Tirres don't know anything about the subject. he can't teach anything in class. He will ask you to read 1000 pages... and then summry them..because he have no idea about them.He will try to push his political and religion agenda on you. 3 midterms,R.paper,fina</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: REL257<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very nice! There is hw and reading every night, but its not too much.  His exams are a bit difficult, but he gives you many extra credit opportunities. Hes very personable and he wants his class to have fun but still learn. I would def recommend him.</div></div></div></body></html>
