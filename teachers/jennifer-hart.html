There is a lot of reading done, which is somewhat dry. Also, she is a hard grader on papers done in class. She has a good personality. If you are a diligent student she will be respectful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2010<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Way to hard of a grader for a simple LSP class. Very dull class material and simply not a good teacher. Felt like a huge waste of time every class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yeah, I agree with the other comments. I mainly didn't like the &quot;lectures&quot;, which comprised of essentially re-reading the passages in the textbook that were the homework, and the class discussions always got off topic. Her comments on my essays and answers to my questions weren't helpful at all either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a ridiculously hard grader. I've always had A's in English and usually enjoy it. She'd give me bad grades on my essays no matter how hard I worked on them, with harsh comments that were not helpful at all. Basically impossible to get an A. Her lectures and attitude weren't so appealing either. I would not recommend this professor to a friend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is horrible! Do not take her class! I have not learned a single thing except how to draw with crayons. Not joking.. This class makes me feel like I'm in sixth grade again, and not in a fun way.  She is harsh on grading for not clarifying what she is looking for.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Find another professor. Prof Hart is a ridiculously unfair/hard grader, especially for a wrd104 class. Not to mention her lectures/attitude are both equally annoying. Take another professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2010<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard grader. Doesn't give a lot of clarity until after you've already written the papers. Harder grading scale than other wrd104 classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very hard grader... subject was interesting but it tended to get boring with all of the papers.. if you do not like to write short stories, literary analysis, or research papers do NOT take this course!! Field trips were a lot of fun...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2007<br>Class Name: ENG101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher.
