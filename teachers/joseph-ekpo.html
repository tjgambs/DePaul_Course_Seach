    This is the greatest man ever. He absolutely helped me with everything. Even in the middle of night he helps. I couldn't think of a better professor

    Absolutely great professor! He is very knowledgeable and caring, and has absolutely enthralling stories of his life that was generally pertinent to the class.  I recommend taking his class if you get the chance.

    Professor Ekpo was by far one of the best professors I have ever had.  He was extremely encouraging, the work load was respectable but not overwhelming and he was extremely approacable about anything, on or off subject.  Phenomenal Professor
