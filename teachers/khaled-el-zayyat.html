Mid-term is good is you have your notes , Final is a very hard, its a required class or else i would have NEVER taken it with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2006<br>Class Name: IT640<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Khaled was my Telecommunications and Networking professor. I have to tell you, he wasn't as bad as others here have posted. But then, I'm a non-traditional student, and am more forgiving. There are some communication issues as a result of cultural differences. So, he isn't as clear as he could be. But, I learned quite a bit in his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2006<br>Class Name: TDC361<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've 15 yrs work in the subject. Aced all the homework, and the Midterm. Turned in the paper, didn't do the presentation (schedule conflicts). Even if he dinged me 50% of the net 15% for it, I'd have to FLUNK the final to get the C he gave me. He didn't post grades for my final or paper. REFUSED to reply to *multiple* inquiries for an explanation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2005<br>Class Name: TDC361<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amiable, but lacks any demonstratable, real world perspective outside of the laboratory. Poor communication skills. Appears completely bereft of any understanding of 'professional courtesy'. Uses e-mail selectively. May not respond.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/12/2005<br>Class Name: TDC311TDC36<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolute moron.. in 02 I took his class, and he have me a C+ .. I had a A- in the class!!  I tried to appeal but they stuck up for his dumb ass.. Even a few straight A students got B.. He rushed the grade since he left for  Jordan the next day. It is a miracle they let a moron like him teach. His grading is inconsistent like playing the lotto... Ppl get grade they dont deserve hi or low. They should can him doesn know the material well, just book smart.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2005<br>Class Name: TDC362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Khaled is a good guy.  That being said, his class is a bit difficult and his tests are challenging.  He is willing to answer any question but sometimes he gets a bit nervous.  Overal, he's a good professor that can definately take a joke. (He had to with me) I have taken him twice so far and would probably take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: TDC361<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2005<br>Class Name: TDC311<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awsome man....if you would like to learn..definitely take him...easy going..and always helps...he is an A+++</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2005<br>Class Name: TDC362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher. Explains matermial well, Very knowledgeable of the subject, and on the top of all; treats you with respect. I do recommend him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: TDC362<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Only take him for TDC classes if you already know what's being taught.  Very hard to understand.  Curtis White is much better for this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: TDC362<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NO NO NO NO, just say NO to him if you can.  Way too much emphasis on final, hard to understand, very boring.  Nice guy but not an ideal teacher at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2005<br>Class Name: TDC311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not the best of professors but does an okay job explaining. You should listen during class midterm and final is based off it. If you get an A on the final you get an A which is sweet. It will be hard to listen, he is boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: TDC311<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher, doesnt speak that clearly. Can be boring, if you plan on to sleep you shouldnt take it.. you will probably fail. But if you take time and study you should get better than a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2004<br>Class Name: TDC311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class, very easy to learn the concepts...and I took the class via DL.  The homeworks and quizzes are easy.  The midterm is a take home, and the final is open notes.  I couldn't fail this class even if I tried.  A+</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2004<br>Class Name: TDC362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is ridiculous. His grading system is obviously ridiculous and his &quot;extra credit&quot; is purely ficticous. His class is boring and not useful in the real world, but most of all his grading is arbitrary and unjust.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2004<br>Class Name: TDC311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took the class DL.  Horrible at accomodating DL students.  Doesn't check email.  Doesn't speak up.  Horrible accent.  Doesn't explain things very well.  His class was definitely an easy A, but the book was useless.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: TDC361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgable, readily avaliable outside of class.  Very friendly once you get to know him.  Teaches out of the book, so there are no surprises on the test.  The tests are not hard but they apply what you learn; beyond memorization.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2003<br>Class Name: TDC362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is knowledgable, but not friendly, harsh in his teaching method, hard grader, and is VERY boring...he teaches straight out of the book, no personality what-so-ever...walking GEEK.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2003<br>Class Name: ECT361<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class over all.
