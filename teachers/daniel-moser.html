He made theatre relevant to my major and easy to understand the content. He's extremely knowledgeable, passionate, and a down-to-earth guy (some even called him Daniel). We even went to see a play as a class and hung out at a bar afterwards. You'll have a great time with him. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2009<br>Class Name: THEA<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took his THE 100 and a CMN course. He truly cares about his students, not just &quot;getting a good grade&quot; but encouraged students to challenge themselves.I walked away with practical knowledge, not just information regarding a specific topic. Students who say he's difficult dislike working and are used to hand-holding so common in academia these days.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2009<br>Class Name: TH100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful professor! Very passionate and experienced in theater. Approachable, easy to talk to, and conducts great discussions that connects theater with everyday life situations. Highlight of the class: Saw a superb play with the class at Victory Gardens and entire class was later invited to meet and mingle with cast members after the show.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2009<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrific professor ? truly one of the finest theatre professors at DePaul, informative and helpful; always willing to discuss issues with students one-on-one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2009<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pros: Professor is knowledgable about the subject and is passionate about theater. Cons: He is not clear on assignments, quizes are hard and you have to take them before you ever discuss the plays, the readings are pretty long, he keeps you until 9 on the nose. Does not use Blackboard! Although i got a good grade, I would not take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2008<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>R u kidding me&#63; way too much reading!

Self-important and argumentative during discussions. Treated SENIORS like freshman, but wanted us to act like adults. No food, drink, or... anything else basically. To his credit, he lightened up by the end of the quarter... though minimally</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2007<br>Class Name: PRF100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Moser is easily one of the best theatre professors you can have at DePaul. He provides a flawlessly well-rounded class which not only looks at plays themselves, but also puts them in context in several ways. You have quizzes, a vocab midterm, and your final is to write about ANYTHING theatre. Take his class. Well worth your time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2006<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! Unless you have already taken theatre classes and know all about different plays, this class is horrible! He expects you to already know about everything he teaches and if you don't you're screwed! Take someone else, cause it's sposed to be a good class, but this professor just ruins it. STAY AWAY!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2006<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an OK prof. A bit pretentious, though. The class is not easy at all, and the mid-term & final are hard as hell! Maybe cause it's a 3hr night class, but i did not like the class at all. I think it's just me though; I wouldn't completely dismiss him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WOW!!  He is such an amazing prof.  You learn so much from this class, he makes it so interesting.  He is by far one of the best prof. at DePaul.  If you are willing to make an effort and listen in class, you will do very well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awsome Professor.

Understanding and understandable and very interesting. He's a little full of himself, but most artsy people are. The plays were interesting, and the assigments were not too hard. Definitely recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: THE100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's got a Napolean complex.
