But the papers were only 3 pages. She is incredibly knowledgeable on the topic and passionate. Class may seem like a lot of work at first but she thoroughly explains everything and is very personable and helpful inside and outside the class, making it easy. Highly recommended for LSP 200</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2011<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is incredibly interesting.  I had zero interest prior to taking it.  There are reading quizzes every class period, two short papers to choose from out of about 10, one final paper, midterm, and final.  Courtney gives study guides and is MORE than willing to help with any questions!  Take her!  She is very passionate and knowledgeable!</div></div></div></body></html>
