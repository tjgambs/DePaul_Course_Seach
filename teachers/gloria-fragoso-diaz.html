The class assignments were easy, usually only one short paper each week.  The online tests were very difficult and even with the book in front you hard to make a's on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She means well but this class was very boring. I can tell that she's interested in the subject but for the harder stuff she teaches very fast and for the easier stuff she takes forever. She also puts some ridiculous questions on the tests that are unrelated to the concepts we were learning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2010<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She basis her class lectures on the power point slides which shes posts before class. If you do not study the power point slides or read you will fail the class. Most of the questions on her exams are T/F. Take someone else if you want better clarification!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: MGT202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are looking for a boring class but a good grade take her. If you want to be involved and learn a lot then dont. Homework usually takes a long time and is often done in groups. She  reads off the slides. Takes a long time to answer emails. Final is easy and she gives 3 extra credit questions. One of the worst prof at dpu</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I cannot comprehend how stupid some of these reviews are. She is soooo easy. Her midterm had questions that involved 8th grade math. Other questions were common sense questions. If you don't take her for MGT 301,then you are just as dumb as some of these people below who reviewed her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2010<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>And to add to my review: If you think she reads off the slides, you haven't been paying attention. She does many real life examples in class (off the top of my head: Kuwait oil fires, airlines, various product safety, etc). The only problem is there is a gap between her and students since she doesn't speak English perfectly. AFAIK: Tests are MPC.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2010<br>Class Name: MGT202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher/class. Don't take her if at all possible. Everyone that has commented is on cue with her teaching style/performance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Relatively easy class, though so boring! She is very smart and amazingly knowledgeable person on this subject, but the class is so totally pointless and useless (for different industries will apply six sigma quality differently). I think people rate her based on the subject of the class, not on her personal/teaching values and it's totally unfair!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2009<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady, but probably one of the worst professors I have ever had.  Lectures directly from textbook slides and when asked questions that are not in the textbook she has no clue how to answer.  Complete waste of tuition $$s, avoid at all cost!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2009<br>Class Name: MGT502<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady, but really hard to understand. Very upset with DePaul University, since I paid way too much money for tuition and ended up teaching myself from the book.   Not sure if this teacher has ever worked in industry. Avoid this teacher at all cost.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This lady doesnt know sh*t about the material. All she does is read word for word from the slides. She thinks she is some kind of professional but let me tell you, any time anyone asked her a question she would take sooooo much time to explain her answer. She is extremely ignorant and i would definitely STAY AWAY.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away if you can. Very dull and boring. she has the experience but very sensitive about everything. easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2009<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was such a struggle just to pass the time in her class. You look at the clock and you wonder how only 2 minutes have gone by. Not a single person was ever engaged in class, partly because the material is so boring, but mostly because she is ineffective. Very nice lady, but stay away.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the others that she is confusing and not just because of her accent. It's easier to learn the material if you read the book yourself because all she does is read the book to you in class. She has terrible teaching techniques and her class is a complete waste of time. Take her if you enjoy teaching easy material to yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: MGT315<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this teacher is confusing. the only reason i got an A in her class was because i already took this class one but didnt transfer. half the time she doesnt make sence. her examples come straght out of book(copy and past). and is to lazy to set up solver for a problem just shows the structor that book gives. paid 4 grand for lazyness! stay away</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2008<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very frustrating to learn from a teacher who is not very smart herself. Frequently took off points for no reason, only to regrade them and improve your grade. Very unengaging and should be avoided.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2008<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sweet woman...means well...yet I really did not pay for someone to read the book to me...required to complete homework assignments in the book but everything I learn in the class was self taught...upside I got a B for never really attending class It depends what you want from a class I guess</div></div></div></body></html>
