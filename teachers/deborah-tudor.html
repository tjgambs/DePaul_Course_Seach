Her &quot;pretentious&quot; view of &quot;mainstream&quot; film is probably justified, and I know for a personal fact that she doesn't hate film simply for its mainstream status.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: CMN206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Damn those film professors with opinions on film.

She doesnt like any movie that is mainstream, just because it is mainstream.  She thinks she is the authority on good movies and that she knows everthing about cinema.  do not take a class from her unless you want to be bored to death.  ps, never share an opinion about anything!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: FILM<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very intusiastic about what she teaches. Material is easy to learn and she makes it interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: FLIM<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like her, but her comments are sometimes a little strange. She tried very hard to impress our speaker, which was both cute and annoying. But I think she's good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2005<br>Class Name: CMN387<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Tudor is goofy and hilarious, but also as intellectual as they come. I really enjoyed this class and others I've taken with her. Be prepared to do lots of reading, but also be very entertained, and learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2005<br>Class Name: CMN206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2005<br>Class Name: FILM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tudor knows a lot about cinema in general, but her reading of film content was weak at best, and her theory background is non-existent. Her brilliant interpretation of the Fellini film we watched, said after a long thoughtful pause:&quot;It's an expression of humanism!&quot; That's it. And that was the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: FEMANDDOC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Dr Tudor, but even I got very frustrated with her this time around. Generally she's hilarious, interesting, and intelligent, but she seemed run-down last quarter. Also, feminist documentaries are ridiculous. But I don't see the &quot;pretentious-hippie&quot; thing...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2005<br>Class Name: FEMDOC<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tudor has the best intentions, but this class is just plain awful.  I don't know how she is in her other classes, but her pretentious-hippie personality drives me absolutely nuts, and the films we watch are just as bad. Why must feminist always equate to really, really weird&#63; Hard grader, bad class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: CMN348<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Tudor is clearly one of the most intelligent and knowledgable professors at this school AND she manages to stay unpretentious. There is reading and work to the course (she loves articles), but is as accommodating as she is demanding. Interested in her students and their opinions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: CMN271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lot's of work to get you going, but all helpful.  She knows her stuff, and has great personality.  I've taken many, 3, classes with her, and want more.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: FILMCMN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED her! One of the best profs. ever! Clear and interesting! You do have to work for your grade.  She also was really personable and went the extra step to get to know her students.  Best class discussions ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2004<br>Class Name: FILM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's wonderful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i love dr. tudor, she rocks! her classes are incredibly informative and she has hilarious side comments - i'm always laughing while i'm learning. and an added benefit, she has great jewelry!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2004<br>Class Name: CMN206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would definitely take a class with her again, she's extremely knowledgable and I enjoy classes where teachers love their subjects. She's pretty funny, too, and if you want someone who loves movies as much as you do, take one of her classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2004<br>Class Name: CMN206<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>it is great to have a professor who loves her subject. she picks exactly the right clips to watch in class. her tests are very specific, but it's not complicated stuff. though, she doesn't frequently comment on written work, and is a little curt at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: CMN273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor, tests require you to actually define terms (no multiple choice), but she tells you what will be on that test and what to study.  The paper required for the class was very straightforward, and she is a fair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2004<br>Class Name: CMN271<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Totally boring, fell asleep during every movie. But I still managed to get an A. She's easy and super nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2004<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you aren't a film snob then you will have a hard time understanding her.  Even though she is kind of arrogant, she is sexy in some sort of aloof European way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2004<br>Class Name: FILM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a Communications prof, she is an expert at acting confident and knowing, but she really needs to spend more time with scholarship.  I learned little to nothing about the films we watched outside of glib comments. Her grading is also inconsistent. Bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2003<br>Class Name: CMN206<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Favors women actually!  This professsor turned me off to my dream of being a part of the film industry.  Tudor is not helpful and looks down upon those that aren't as quick to comprehend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2003<br>Class Name: CMN206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take her seriously and you will do well.  Take her lightly and it's a long hard road.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2003<br>Class Name: FILMAESTH<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She keeps it real.  No bull****.  Good sense of humor possibly favors boys over girls.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2003<br>Class Name: CMN349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2003<br>Class Name: FILMHIST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very difficult, and gives hard assignments but is fair. She has cool clothes and great jewelry! She has a fun sense of humor, too. I learned a lot. Oh, her red hair is pretty neat too!</div></div></div></body></html>
