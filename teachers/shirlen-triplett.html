    Dr. Triplett is a smart, insightful, and compassionate instructor. She deeply cares about all of her students and gives her all. Not only is she inspirational, she is a great leader and mentor that I inspire to be one day. Dr. Triplett is enthusiastic and clear while teaching her lessons. I learned so much from her!

    Great teacher there was a lot of material in the we had to cover but she made it work. You take quite a bit of notes from text and class but I would take a class from her again. In fact I would seek one out.

    I like Triplette. She knows what she is talking about, she can tend to babble on for a while, but she is a good professor. Her exams are not hard, everything is gone over in class. She is knowledgable on the subject, I would take her again.
