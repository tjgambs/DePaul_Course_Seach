All the articles are posted online. She is very nice, but her lectures are not very clear and confused. No lecture slide, no written on board, she will explain the articles and you need to take note by yourself. Final paper about 7 pages. Three quiz and midterm. Easy grader. Will have study guides for quiz and midterm. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice woman, but in my opinion, an average professor. She is really passionate about what she teaches, but because of some communcation barriers, I feel like she doesn't always convey points clearly. Lectures can get boring at times, but she is an easy grader and gives extra credit assignments. Speak up in class, she's big on participation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2011<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful, wonderful woman! I loved her lecture. People may find her boring, but she's really interesting when you listen. I understand Socrates/Plato so well now. You LEARN from her class. Easy grader and a bit self-conscious, but well meaning and super nice. One of my best professors. So glad I took her class. But don't underestimate her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2011<br>Class Name: PHIL101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice woman. The class can be a bit boring at times but interesting if you pay attention. She is an easy grader. She usually tells you what she wants beforehand anyway so its easy. Participation in the class is a bit intimidating however because she usually wants a specific answer and she takes note on who participates.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: PHIL101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher! Very clear about what she wants and her lectures are VERY helpful. Take notes! She always encourages people to come in for help.  Her exams are NOT multiple choice- they are all short answer and an essay but she is an easy grader. We had one extra credit essay.  Keep up with the reading!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2011<br>Class Name: HTL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This year her class is more interesting. She is recently much clear than before. I enjoy to attande her lectures; since they are very useful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2011<br>Class Name: AT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is kind and makes herself available to her students. However, she is extremely boring which makes it difficult to pay attention in class... Especially since she lectures the entire period. Her only grades consist of quizzes and tests, so it is beneficial to study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes really boring, but she's also really nice and means well.
