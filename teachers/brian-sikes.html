Although he does work at a fast pace, he is always willing to go back and repeat things, or to give individual help. He makes his assignments as clear as possible. You will have to do work outside of class, but that's to be expected. In all, a very enjoyable class, and a very enjoyable teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you already know photoshop, the first 4 weeks you'll hate this class. But Sikes is very very specific about what he wants and you will learn a lot if you are able to keep up with the pace. Don't miss class, he isn't an jerk about attendance but you'll miss information.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2010<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're not a mac person he kinda talks down to you as if you've never used a computer. other than that he's a great guy and a great teacher. Always willing to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2008<br>Class Name: ART200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, great teacher.  First half of the class was a bit of a bore, but then I really got into it and he opened up to us more as a teacher towards the end.  I really like him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2007<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very nice, and I learned a lot, but he is extremely fast paced! If you are a slow learner DO NOT take him. He will keep going and will leave you behind.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes such a great teacher! the class is fast-paced but you learn alot, and draw alot! He expects you to try your best, but it doesn't really matter if drawing isn't your biggest strength. Hes pretty much the guy from the movie &quot;Art School Confidential&quot;.. its almost freaky how similar they are. I definitely recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/15/2006<br>Class Name: ART200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the best professor I had last year- learned so much in this class, will be keeping the notes from it just for personal reference.  Class moved from mostly lecture (he loves to talk) to more readings + discussion. One of the most interesting lectures was when he talked about himself and his history as an artist.  Not easy, but so worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/29/2006<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have a good idea who wrote some of the really negative comments here, and I can say with certainty that their opinions are not to be trusted.  They are either pretentious whiners (A common problem here at DePaul: &quot;Omigod, this teacher sucks so bad, like, omigod, right&#63;&quot;) or lazy. Sikes' enthusiasm makes even boring material exciting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: ART200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The man hates to give As even if you deserve it. I got an A- on everything in the class and he gave me a B+. Hes a nice guy and is extremely enthusiastic about the subject of the class, but the class it self is boring and you want to fall asleep. Take the class if you have to, but be warned you will not get an A or an A-.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: ART200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the second class I have taken with Sikes. He is amazing, great teacher and all around good guy. He is a reasonable grader and very helpful. I would recommend him to any art student.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2006<br>Class Name: ART<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2005<br>Class Name: ART<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: SEVERAL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sikes is amazing by far the best teacher I have had at DePaul, he is informative, helpful and maintains awesome relationships with his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: ART200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You have to work hard for an A, but it's so worth it. Wonderful class, fantastic teacher- he's passionate about what he does, extremely knowledgeable and just a great guy overall. I highly recommend Prof. Sikes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2005<br>Class Name: DRAWING<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: ART392<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Brian and always will but he talks and talks and talks... when three sentences would get the same point across. Needs to manage time better as we often got out late. This class was MUCH easier than his average shctick. A- class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2005<br>Class Name: ART200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2004<br>Class Name: ART106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher and very challenging as an art proffesor should be. Has a huge vocabulary and probably should be teaching at a higher level. Very Good overall. I recommend if you want to become a better artist.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: TOOLBOX<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher- VERY helpful, but a very hard grader...be prepared to work hard for a A-. Nice guy, intimidating at first, but you come to love him. Knows his stuff- I reccomend him. Hes not as bad as others say he is, honestly. Just do your work and do it well!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2004<br>Class Name: TOOLBOX<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my hardest art class and I am an art major. Makes you work really hard, tough grader, and likes to hear his own voice. But he is very helpful and nice. A little intimidating at first. Talks excessivly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2004<br>Class Name: ART200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, I liked him better before I ever took a class with him. I like him well enough now that I'm not in this class. It's scary how hard you have to work for an A-. A great professor despite. He really should be working w/ more advanced students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2004<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy and does not come off as a pompous ass like many art profs.  If you understand the projects and get everything in on time, you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: ARTARTI<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof is a pretty tough grader. The books he chooses are also DENSE. Assignments: one large paper worth 35% of your grade + 3-4 medium sized papers . You're only going to do well if you've taken this sort of thing before and work very hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2003<br>Class Name: ART233<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2003<br>Class Name: ART233<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
