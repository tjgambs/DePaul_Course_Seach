On top of that, final project added a lot more effort during the class.  Grading was very subjective and grader was looking for very specific terms to be used in the answers.  Not a very dynamic lecturer, and lack of examples with real life.  I did not have fun w/this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2011<br>Class Name: SE477<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is extremely boring/monotonous especially if you have a background in systems/software project management. Mumaugh pretty much reads off the slides. Exams are MCQ/short&long essay. Open book. Final project highly depends on your team members. He is very particular about level of detail. Not hard but lots of busy work in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2011<br>Class Name: SE430<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mumaugh has an extremely dry and monotonous teaching style. He reads everything off of his slides & shows little or no interest in the subject matter. That said grading is fairly lenient but his homework is loooong. Tests are all online. Final project all depends on your team.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2008<br>Class Name: SE430<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was a ton of work and assignments were confusing. Grading seemed pretty lenient though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: SE430<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very difficult but fascinating subject matter.  Assignments plentiful and difficult.  Alot of work, but in the end you end up with alot of knowledge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: SE430<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You have to show effort than you get a real good grade. The topic is not easy but he will help you if you ask. The best way is to discuss topics with him in class or via email.  You will learn the most from the assignment and it is essential that you do them! Would take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2006<br>Class Name: SE430<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He can not teach at all.  His lectures are just him reading from the power point slides. About 115 slides per class.  Homeworks take a long time and after about 3 hours of work you still have no idea what the homework called for.  Grades are pass/Fail so you have no idea how you are doing in the class.  I would not take him again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2005<br>Class Name: SE550<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A really hard course, but professor Mumaugh did a great job of teaching it.  Maybe distributed development is more his field, as he really knew his stuff and could answer any question quickly and with clarity.  He was a great teacher and a very friendly guy.  I'd take him again if the opportunity came up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He cannot teach and this was by far the most BORING class I have ever taken.  His assignments, quizzes, and tests are extrememely hard.  On a positive note, he does not fail anyone.  I failed both the midterm and final, performed okay on the homework and still got a C.  He only gives As, Bs, and Cs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class via distance learning.  This is by far the WORST class I have ever taken.  He is a nice guy, but he cannot teach whatsoever.  He should either work in industry full-time (R&D environment) or simply retire.  Assignments & Tests are very hard and he offers no help whatsoever!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2005<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The guy is brilliant but he has no business teaching.  He is unable to explain the concept in others terms so that the class understands.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2005<br>Class Name: CSC373<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he goes off on random tangents, and you end up wondering what you are actually supposed to know. When asked a question he can rarely answer it so the class understands.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2005<br>Class Name: CSC<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard...</div></div></div></body></html>
