I wouldn't recommend him due to how he lectures for about 15 minutes talking about how not getting A on any of your classes won't lead you any career. Goes over the lecture slides pretty quick and most of his steps are kind of vague. Tests are not that hard, but get read to study for the final. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2015<br>Class Name: 562317<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>He is the worst teacher I have ever had. I would not recommend taking his class ever. He screamed at me in the middle of my final for writing down formula's that I memorized on the final... after it was passed out. He accused me of cheating and the entire class had to come to the rescue. My tudor always needed to reteach me. DO  NOT TAKE. HORRIBLE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2015<br>Class Name: 136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible professor. Will lecture at beginning of class, every class, about how getting anything less than an A in his class will not lead to a career in the future.

However, it is important to note that some of the methods that Zhandi uses to teach are much more confusing than need be; that said, many of the other students had a hard time grasping the concept as he wasn't particularly helpful with extra explanation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED HIM!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2014<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Hes really the sweetest teacher and very easy going. he gives you the easiest and shortest ways to solve equations! i loved him the overall rating "2.7" is so not accurate he rocks and is a must take if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2014<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives the easiest and shortest way to solve a problem - which is better than doing it step by step.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2014<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult class. I worked my butt off for that A-. You get four tests, and he drops one. Then a final. Add those up and average it and there's your grade. He's very smart, which makes it difficult for him to "dumb it down" and explain more clearly to those of us who struggled with the material. Only take him if you're prepared to study for hours.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible teacher, I dropped the class. He flies through material so fast that no one can understand. Tests are multiple choice but the material is totally different than what he discusses in class. He kept telling everyone that they should be in MAT 095. Uses power points that students can't access and we didn't ever use the book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very good professor IF you are good at math. The class was easy for me, but many students dropped. He makes tests from problems he highlights in class, so tests are easy if you attend class regularly. He is one of those math professors who is too smart to explain things for non-math brains, but is very helpful if you need outside help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took MAT 136 with professor Zandi this past spring and got a B+ for the course.He explaines well and I learned a lot from him. He drops the lowest test score and curves the final grades. Don't listen to few loosers below who have either failed or have barely made a C-. My advice, take him, you will learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay, this man is the worst.  He will make you want to transfer.  He has 4 tests that are multiple choice.  The material on the test was completely different from the lecture.  He is condescending and very in-your-face rude to students who ask questions.  You have to WORK extremely hard to "earn" a C.  Trust me, DO NOT TAKE HIM. YOU WILL BE SORRY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take MAT 136 with this guy. You are graded on 4 multiple choice tests that all have none of the above as an answer. His tests are extremely difficult and he doesn't give points for work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2013<br>Class Name: 136<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Save yourself the heartache and take a different teacher. He gives you extra material to cover that other professors don't. Your C will be worth someone else's A in another class. He's a nice guy. It just sucks that you have to work so much harder in his class to get the same A your friend in another class is getting for 1/4 of your workload.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2013<br>Class Name: MTH200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher, I would not recommend him.  He would miss class, he missed five classes without communicating that to us.  He would then fly through material to play catch up expecting everyone to understand it because he just did it.  He relies on power points. Constantly needs to be corrected on mistakes by the students. I took him at Harper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2012<br>Class Name: MAT095<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I as an incoming freshman, and math is my weakest subject, I thought that Professor Zandi was a good teacher. Yes he would speed while he lectures the lesson, but I've learned things that I NEVER learned from any of my high school teachers. I recommend him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2012<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What we learned in class was not the same as what was on our online homework. We learned things out of order.. we learned the basics last and the most difficult material first. My tutor had to reteach everything to me because Mr. Zandi talked and wrote soooo fast and did not explain the steps of a problems. Everyone say there staring off into space</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2012<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I Didn't do the work on a timely basis but I believe he taught the class well from what I remember from the lectures I was ready for.  Many late nights cramming the HW in were aided by  a memory of something he said in class.  His class would have been easy if I had done my HW on time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2012<br>Class Name: MATH130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Zandi is a clear teacher, he does not only rely on the mymathlab slides, he actually takes the time to teach his class his own way and always asks for questions from the previous section covered! take him </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2012<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall he has a good personality, but he is not a good professor. He relies on power points pre made on Mymathlab and runs through the lesson so quickly that it is hard to understand. He insists that the class should know everything he has &quot;taught&quot; yet no one knows what he is saying. I do not recommend him at all!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2011<br>Class Name: MATH140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Zandi grading method is not helping to the students.Hours and hours students spend doing homework at MyMath Lab.During class he goes so fast through the material,his in class tests are multiple choice questions (app 10 questions).If you miss 2-3 questions you are in deep trouble.I would not recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2011<br>Class Name: MATH140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Zandi grading method  is not helping students.  Like someone commented his class is hit or miss.  I do not think he pays attention to do homework students have to do on MyMath Lab.  He pays attention to the online quizes and tests in the class only.  If I have to retake Math 140 I would not take it with Prof. Zandi.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2011<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Math has always been hard for me, but Prof Zandi made it very easy by showing every step there is to solve a problem.

He ensures that you know the material before the test. The test reflects from homework and examples in the class. He writes his own tests so you'll know what to expect. Take him.

All these past comments are only the people who failed his class. DO NOT listen to them! Take it from me, I took 2 classes with him He made the material so much more easier, he makes sure you understand the material well before the exam.

He often made mistakes when he was doing problems on the board.  His hand writing was not clear, and he did not explain things thoroughly.

His final for Calc 1 was 10 questions multiple choice and I ended up with a D+ in the class, so I probably had to retake it over 1 question.  He flies through the material, doesn't care if you don't get it, and is not very personable so don't bother office hrs.
