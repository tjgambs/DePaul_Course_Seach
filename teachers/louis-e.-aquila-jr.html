Weird right? You'll learn something. He's tough but he's also lenient on the homework and quizzes. If you stay on top of the work assigned, you should get an A without breaking a sweat. Go to class.

Show up to class on time, put your cell phone away and do your work and you wont have any problems.

Great professor, and totally understanding. If youre not good at math- take him! I literally did terrible in math all throughout high school! Aquila's way of teaching totally changed that and I am doing great in the class, and I even enjoy math now! Plus, he's a funny old man with lots of stories!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2011<br>Class Name: MAT141<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Louis is definitely one of the BEST math professors at DePaul. I would say the workload in his class is moderate and he gives the students a lot of leeway on HW/quizzes to help pad your grade. The final was based on old quiz questions so it was relatively easy to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everything based off online software. You will spend hours and hours practicing, but when you et to higher math classes you will thank him. I used to be horrible at math, and I got an A which is huge. Love this guy, just listen and don't ask questions. If you do the online hw and learn on that then you can sleep in his class and get an A. Recommene</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2010<br>Class Name: MTH100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i do not recommend him for math100. he is very condescending and rude. If you have a question, he'll make you look like a fool and feel stupid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2009<br>Class Name: LL205<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Where do I begin! I am currently taking his QR course right now -in wk 6 of 10. There is just too much homework to complete for this class. Prof Aquila confuses the hell of the class with an unclear syllabus and expects everyone to figure out what he is trying convey. He sends useless emails which don't pertain to any of the math problems. Beware!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2009<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was very helpful for me. We had homework due every class which kind of sucked. I found the class easy because he gives you a practice exam for the midterm and final which is very similiar, I recomend taking him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2008<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Prof Aquila in Spring Quarter of 2000. It's been 8 years and I still remember him! He's one of the best faculty in the math department. Yeah he can be a bit cranky sometimes, but it's all tough love! He really cares about his students. Go visit him during his office hours. He's genuine and will want to get to know you personally.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2008<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, a it boring but he will pretty much pass anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this professor has to be one of the most disrespectful people i've ever met. completely pompous and doesn't care how well you do. he will degrade you in front of everyone if you ask questions even though he always messes up on problems... plus he rambles about irrelevant stuff and in a night class this is the absolute worst... stay away</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2008<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a bit batty, but a very sweet man.  He is only hard if you don't keep up with the work.  All of the homework and quizzes are online and if you're okay with learning some on your own this is the class to take.  Three in class tests and he goes over the questions before the test.  Really Easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2007<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, very easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2007<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cutest old man ever!  His class is super easy if you can take it with him DO! I really want to take him again everything he teaches is so easy you do all assignments and take quizzes online if you don't get an A you are a moron!

Most people bombed the final because they were totally lost. They got so used to the take home exams that they forgot how to study.

His comments are atrocious and demeaning. He treats his adult students like they are stupid and don't follow directions. His syllabus is totally unclear and he expects everything to be an exact template of what he wants in his mind. Horrendous teacher. Worst math teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/04/2006<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest class I ever took in my life!!!! I wish I took him for all my BMS courses.  He gives take home tests, quizes, midterms, and a take home final thats exactly like the real final just different numbers.  Very nice guy that wants you to succeed but sort of old fashioned and boring.  I would recommend him to everyone looking to get straight A's</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stats and Business Calc is hard enough, this teacher makes it easy. Take home tests, take home Mid Term and open-book, open note Final. I mean, you CANT go wrong. If you don't get an A or B, you just dont care. You actually have to WORK hard to fail his class.

Not only is he very thorough and gives you good notes, all the &quot;Tests&quot; (it's actually graded homework assignments) are take home, midterm is take home, test is open note open book and based on the practice final which he gives you the answers for. You'd be stupid NOT to take him. Great prof!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is old fashioned, but i understand what he teaches. I hate math, only through him have i been able to pass my math classes. I took him for bms 125/126 and i get a better grade each class. I am taking him again in bms 142. If you do not care for math, he is the professor to take. trust me! Picture it: TAKE HOME QUIZZES/TESTS!
