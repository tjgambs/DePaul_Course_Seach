    Knows what he's talking about, but his lectures can be quite dry.  As for the homework: there's assignments due every class but they are not too difficult.  His class covers more on the actual history of recording rather than just on ProTools software but it is quite interesting.

    There is homework due for each class with readings, the class was hard but I thought it was interesting. if the only reason you want to take this class is to learn how to be a dj in 10 weeks don't sign up for this class because we actually learn about the background of music not only how to mix in protools.

    Save yourself a headache and take something else. This guy's lectures are dry and will literally put you to sleep. There is an assignment due EVERY CLASS covering vague and technical readings about recording. They are nothing but busy work. The labs are all right, but 6 is too many and I don't think he's reviewed his own lab instructions in years.

    Nice guy, agreed.  I found that the class added to my understanding of the broad subject of recording.  This is not a course covering ProTools software alone.  When I took the course there were four labs.

    Lots of busywork! Wasn't that effective teaching the material and was pretty unorganized. Really hated his class by the end of the year, but I'll cut him some slack because his wife had a baby in the middle of the quarter so that might have made things tough on him. Knows a lot about the subject but doesn't teach well.

    Nice, easy guy. Makes you do busy work in class, doesn't really teach about the subject itself. You only end up doing two labs, didn't really learn all that much.
