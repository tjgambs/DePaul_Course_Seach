He´s intelligent but lacks clarity and common sense. He gives long-winded and confusing answers to seemingly straighforward questions, easily gets off topic, and doesn´t cover most of the material on the exams. He lied to the class that he wrote the textbook answer key and can´t write a proper email.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2014<br>Class Name: RE354<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not cool and really closed minded.
