    She's a genuinely nice woman, but she's really bad at communicating. Her class is a lot more bearable, though, if you ask VERY specific questions and stay involved during class. Study hard - she almost never gives enough time to finish tests.

    She's such a sweet person. So sweet. But she's impossible to follow and she has a really hard time getting her point across. Communication is not her strong suit.
