Coursework and exercises were applicable and well thought out - not just busy work! Very likeable, helpful and accessible. Always focused and informative.  Would  definitely take another course with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2012<br>Class Name: FOUNDSEMI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Ellen for Foundations, as well as for Research Seminar. Ellen is well travelled, whip smart, and experienced. She is patient, kind, understanding - and expects a lot of her students. If you're lazy, she's hard. If you want a good education, she's awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2011<br>Class Name: SNLL8L9<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard! Hard! Hard!

By far the hardest instructors I've encountered here at DePaul! Work is hard to understand in her class....Fail her class, but retook it & pass with flying colors! I think she needs to teach graduate level courses.....too intense for undergraduate level!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2010<br>Class Name: LL300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is true what they say about this professor.  She loves to make people do work over, over, over, and over again.. oh yeah did i say over&#63;  Her instructions are very unclear.  She is by far one of the worst teachers ever.  She thinks that becuase she as a PhD that undergrads must be on her level as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2008<br>Class Name: LL300<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor makes assignments difficult, she does not give clear examples of the finished project she is looking for. Likes to have the student do the work over again. Her instructions are sometimes unclear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2008<br>Class Name: FALLL<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her for Foundations of Adult Learning. Hard but fair when it comes to grading, definitely looks out for your best interest and wants you to succeed. Highly recommend her for a faculty mentor.</div></div></div></body></html>
