Alot of the homework is done in groups and the midterm is open book.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2011<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is really dry and boring. Class consists of open note, open book midterm (which he curves), weekly assignments (mostly in groups) and a take home final. just study the slides and you'll do fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2010<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did not buy the book, only the cases and got a B+.And it is true that no matter what you will receive no lower than a B+.He is an extremely nice and understanding guy. Also very intelligent and helps you understand the material.  Take him for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2009<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy but if you want to get a B+ no matter how much effort you put in, then go ahead and take this class. Everyone seemed to get no lower than that on assigments even though some obviously put in less effort. Everything is graded subjectively and he seems to pick favorites that get better grades. Also the classes are extremely boring and useles</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy.  Class is more theoretical and big picture than analytical.  Consequently, lectures were a bit unstructured.  He's a fair grader, though.  As long as you read the material and give the assignments your best effort, you'll do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2009<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lindquist stressed the theory and big picture in his lectures.  So, if you want to actually learn the technical side of financial statement analysis you might not get your moneys worth.  Grading is half case studies and half final exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2009<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The course covers several cases with Professor Lindquist applying his real world perspectives.  While there is some clarity lost at the fundamental level, you will benefit from not getting bogged down in things and understanding the big picture.  Professionally accomplished and willing to work to help.  Doesn't stress grades as much as learning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2009<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Twilight zone every lecture ! Course is alot of math and formulas, but somehow wants you 'think outside the box'. Expects you to be a CPA and does not explain valuation concepts in great detail. Frequently drifts off topic and flips through dozens of slides.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2009<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst finance professor at DePaul.  Covers 20 chapters of material in 10 weeks, doesn?t explain concepts fully, no HW or solutions to problems, and lectures are just him flipping through slides.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His grading is Great! Very easy/fair!  He also is very nice guy... Do your cases!!! Final is take home and for midterm, u can use ur book,laptop(if you have notes on it-just say you do),notes, etc...EASY grade... Great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is EXTREMELY fair when it comes to grading, ect... Show up to class interested in the subject (which isn't hard) and you'll do fine. The homework load wasn't heavy at all, and he is always willing to help you out if you don't understand something. Overall, a great professor and I'd recommend it to everyone from the senior slacker to the crowning</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2006<br>Class Name: FIN333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgable & willing to help if you ask. Be prepared for class and you'll do fine. The book is rather bland.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: FIN524<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEWARE. Take another professor for this course.  Ths guy has years of relevant real-world experience and brings none of it to the classroom. You end up teaching yourself the material outside of class to get through the homework (graded) becasue he doesn't cover what you need to know in the lecture, basically just reads the ppt slides to you.</div></div></div></body></html>
