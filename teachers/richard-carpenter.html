I still keep in touch with him today.  So understanding, good sense of humor, great classroom environment.  One of my favorite EDU teachers at DePaul, if not my favorite.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2010<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was very helpful, practical, and understanding.  Great at facilitating discussion.  Respectful of your life outside of class.  A very genuine person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2010<br>Class Name: SEC363<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Carpenter is GREAT! His passion for education comes across in every lecture. You can tell that he really wants his students to become great teachers and genuinely cares about them as individuals. I learned SO much from him about the teacher I want to become.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2007<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best professor that I have had at DePaul, AND in general. So knowledgeable and passionate about passing on his experiences in education. I would highly recommend his class and will forever be grateful for all that he shared.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/16/2006<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was one of the best experiences I have had thus far at DePaul University. This man knows his stuff. He is an oustanding teacher, and he makes the material enjoyable. I took it during the summer, so we moved very fast. It had the potential to be very stressful, but instead I found myself really enjoying it. I got a great amount out of it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2005<br>Class Name: SCU339<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best courses I have taken at DPU. The course was not easy or hard but it was challenging calling for a lot of reading and writing, which is ok. But the invaluble resources (guest speakers, teaching materials, prof's experience) are essential for any developing educator. Plus, Carpenter is skilled esp for surbuban/richer middle schools</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2005<br>Class Name: SCU339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i loved this class.  prof carpenter is very  helpful and very enthusiastic about his job.  He made me change my mind about teaching middle school from &quot;i'll never do it&quot; to &quot; it would be very interesting, i would like to try it&quot;  take his class if you get a chance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2004<br>Class Name: SCU339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this class except there's a lot of reading in writting in this class.  He's really understanding to the students' needs and will adapt the syllibus if needed. But in the end the books and handouts you read in class in the end are really important regardless they seem pointless or repetitive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2004<br>Class Name: SCG439<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good professor, lots of good work experience that he shares from working in middle school, there is some busy work involved</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2004<br>Class Name: SCU339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT Professor. I learned so much in his class, and every class was fun and interesting. He does give a lot of busy work but it's easy and he grades very easy. This class is an easy &quot;A&quot; but you do learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2004<br>Class Name: SCU339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was awesome.

We got out early a lot too.  I think he tries to teach you real issues you'll deal with and actually give you tips to help you as a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: SCU339<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE IS A GREAT TEACHER.
