The information in this class is necessary for every individual to hear and learn! It is top topic subjects (I'm white) it changed A LOT of my views! It helped my judgement and understanding of others! She has a lot of homework but a 6th grader could do it. NOT HARD - GREAT LEARNING!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Holy God!!!

Too much busy work-l feel like I would have learned more if I had more time to read and didn't have to worry about due dates for so many short summaries/journals.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
