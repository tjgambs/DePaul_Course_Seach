You will be held accountable for deadlines and quality, much like in the business world, so follow the guidelines and instructions.

Class is extremely easy. There is very little wiggle room when it comes to errors; i.e. misspellings, grammar, and format. Just go to class and do the work.  You'll find it's one of the easiest classes you ever took. Class never lasted 3 hours so don't worry about it; she goes through things quickly so pay attention!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2011<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although clear, somewhat disorganized. Her dominant personality is a little overwhelming. Very energetic, but there was just something about her that made me want to leave every class.</div></div></div></body></html>
