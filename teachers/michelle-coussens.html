    Very difficult class and useless professor. She does not even attempt to help students, she's literally  the worst instructor I've ever had.

    You defiantly do not want to take this professor, extremely during your senior year.Professor talks down to the students and not helpful. This is suppose to be not a difficult class, but when you have quizzes every week, speakers every week (extremely boring speakers), CapSim, homework it is a bit too much.  We are not graduate students, this is an

    Horrible, and avoid.Its your senior year, and you don't want to ruin your entire DePaul impression over this increditbly useless class. Do NOT take her for the summer, she literally takes a normal depaul quarter into a summer session. She favors, and ashames her students infront of hte entire class. I really don't know why I did this to myself.

    Coussens acts as if she is totally better than you. Excuse me but I can stay at home and download the PowerPoints versus you reading them in class to me. DePaul really has you on staff and you are being paid to teach. Don't talk her because she can't teach, the exams are terrible. She want to control you versus teaching you.

    Winter Quarter '07 was her first one here at DePaul. You talk about a primadonna, she is better than you. She makes you feel like you are in grammar school. Why are you here, you have a full-time job, your own consulting business and now you teach. Don't challenge her on anything because she cannot handle it. Please leave you can't teach
