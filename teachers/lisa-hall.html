    This class was very boring but Mrs. Hall is a very nice lady. All you do is watch movies and write essays. She gave me an &quot;A&quot; so take her class, it's easy.

    Boooooring! By the end of this class you'll realize that white people are the devil. At least, that's what I got out of it. The lessons usually don't go anywhere. Read the homework and try and stay awake and you'll do fine. The only annoying thingis the papers that are due every week. Don't expect to get them back as she loses stuff all the time!

    Kind Easy grader. BUT BORING class, boring materials. If you like to read boring endless materials, and write 2 pages responding paper every week. Moreover, get a voluminous taking home final writing exam. GoAhead take it! I'll never take her class again. SUFFER.

    Topics were boring. Only people that could have gotten something from the class are people who have never seen other ethnicities. Pointless homework and POINTLESS FINAL. Take another ISP.. it isnt worth the crap.

    She is very boring and the movies are pointless.  Also, she is VERY VERY unorganized and missed four night classes and when she made the class up she punished people who couldn't make it during finals week.

    Soooooo boring, and we could never miss any of her pointless classes.  We watched a documentary from the 60's for one half of the class and then had discussions on the other half.  If its an ISP class .. take someone else!

    I love this class because of the issues we talk about.  It's a night class so it can kind of drag but it's good to learn about racism.  There is a response paper for every class but I have never read a whole article and I do fine.

    Her teaching style makes the class very boring and she is often not prepared.  This class however is an easy A but there is a lot of homework and reading assignments.

    She is a nice approacheable teacher. But she is a women studies professor, so you can imagine the **** she can be with guys. 2 page responce papers, lots of reading, power point presentation, boring, the class is easy, but hall can be a **** when it comes to grading.

    She comes off as kind of intimidating when you first meet her but once you get to know her, she is quite nice-just get on her good side. Be a student n show some respect n interest in the class. Participate, engage in discussion or else the class won't be as rewarding. Overall, class is an easy A.

    I don't know...the class was boring, and lots of work was involved. The teacher wasn't good, but she wasn't that bad. And for the record...she's not the hottest, but still, it isn't nice to make fun of people's appearance. She's a good person, it's just that teaching isn't right for her.

    Nice person but bad professor. Not involved with students. Readings everynight, 2pg papers to go along with those readings (theres A LOT), powerpoint presentation, review essays, final essay. Way Too much writing. Class is discussion based. Participate. Wouldnt recommend.
