She expects a lot from her students, but genuinely cares about them. She is obsessed with study abroad and will push you to your full potential. Very motivating and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2012<br>Class Name: FCH323<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really great prof.

Brault was one of the most enjoyable professors I've ever had. She taught me in a couple weeks what other professors taught me in an entire quarter. Her class is not the easiest, the tests are pretty difficult, and she speaks English only occasionally. All these things are worthwhile for Mme. Brault, in my opinion. Une femme super</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2009<br>Class Name: FCH106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's so great! I want to take another class with her before I graduate! I had her as my first French professor in college and it was a great experience! I highly recommend her!It's important to participate and do your homework. Study your grammar and be attentive in class and you should be fine!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2009<br>Class Name: FCH106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice.

One of the top 3 reasons I'm most sad about graduating is that I'll never have the privilege of taking a Brault course again. She's incredibly smart. Sassy. Funny. Passionate. And yes challenging (but not demanding). She will make you WANT to excel. Do yourself and *your French* a favor: sign up for her course right now!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2007<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful and very nice!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2006<br>Class Name: FCH106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's great.  Know your grammar!  It was my downfall...I figured she'd lay off it, but she doesn't.

She's a hard grader but is always there for help with anything. Take her class if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2006<br>Class Name: FCH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sooo so sweet and helpful. Incredibly difficult class if you don't study as it moves quickly, but I that's nothing new for a foreign language. Be careful not to slack off, in class or on your homework because she's really observant.

While learning a foreign language is always difficult, she really made it fun. I'm surprised so many have labeled her as strict or particularly difficult. Her tests were short & easy(her final was just as short & just as easy) My only issue was that so many of the students in my class had already taken French before which was intimidating!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: FCHTRANSLATION<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just finished Mme B's Translation class. For French majors (and minors) this is a must. As ever, I can't speak highly enough about this professor. She is on of the Top 10 at DePaul. Take a class from her - your French will be glad you did! She is a serious professor and expects you to work. If you are up for the challenge - she is the prof for you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2005<br>Class Name: FRENCH101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She will beat your butt, and she;s really strict, but she gives you so much opportunity for extra credit</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2005<br>Class Name: 300IN0002<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>absolutely wonderful prof and person, has helped me as much after graduating as while in her courses. be ready to study and take the course seriously, you will be glad you did. speaking for 300 level courses with Brault only.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: NONE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>never took a class with her, but I can tell she's tough.

She is truly the best! She is a dedicated professor who cares about her students. She inspires you to do your best and when you don't you feel like you let her down. If you are not serious about your studies do NOT take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: FCH329AND201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My favorite prof at DePaul!

Very hard grader if you dont already have the grammer skills down take someone else until you do. She is not very good at teaching the grammer and her tests are hard.

Do not take her course if you plan on dicking around. However, if you are serious about the language and want your comprehension to improve, she's the professor to have. I learned a lot from Brault and I plan on continuing to take her as I get my minor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2005<br>Class Name: FRENCH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She made the class really fun and was extremely helpful.
