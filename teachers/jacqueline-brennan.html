Really easy to talk to and brings freshness to older subjects in animation. Take her for this class and you wont regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2014<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a great class. Professor Brennan showed a lot of examples in class so that it was helpful when we made our own videos later in class. She grades very easy because she knows it's a non-major class. I recommend this, not just because it's easy but because the professor is awesome and I learned quite a bit about animation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2014<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor overall pretty easy class. She does take attendance but overall an easy class. If you had to take a A&L take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Going into the class i was a bit worried because im a business major and i was a little worried i wouldnt know anything, but that wasnt the case. She is the nicest teacher ive ever had. Class is actually fun. you watch videos, do small projects and she doesnt grade you on how good you do, she grades you on if you understood the concept. TAKE HER!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2013<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take her, the class is easy. The midterm and final are videos that you have to make, but they are really easy. 2 analisis papers that are min 2 pages long. If you have to take an A&L Class, take her.</div></div></div></body></html>
