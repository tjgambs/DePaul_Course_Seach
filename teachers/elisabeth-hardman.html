Best education professor at DePaul.  Has class do 12 Unit Organizers (10 pts each) and as long as you do them, it's 100%.  Quizzes on D2L, you get to take them as many times as you like.. 10 Clinical hours required in Spec Ed Classroom/Schools.  Very easy class, if you can't get an A, then you aren't doing the assignments.HIGHLY RECOMMEND</div></div></div></body></html>
