    She is a great teacher. She always explained things really well and always willing to answer any questions. Just keep up with the work and review notes. The tests were challenging but not impossible.

    She is a wonderful teacher. She is always ready for any question and a helping hand. She teaches in her own style, which is a lot easier than the text book. There's a lot of homework but its do-able. Tests are easy if you do the homework. I hate math, but did not mind the class because of her.

    Not a difficult class at all. Work comprises of things you probably will use throughout your life. She rushes in explaining things in class a bit but if you're lost she'll definately stop and take it one step at a time.  Easy to talk to and very understanding =) I'm just angry that this class was easier than the prerequisite classes I had to take!

    I love her. She is by far the most helpful teacher I've ever taken at DePaul. I waited til spring qtr, senior year to take the class and I'm happy I did because I got to take it with her. She's so awesome. Class is not NEARLY as hard as one may think. Daily homework, weekly quiz, midterm, final, powerpt pres &amp; final paper - all simple assignments!

    If you do the homework and go to class most of the time you will not have a problem in her class.  Overall she is very nice and always willing to help.

    She's very clear so your able to understand things.At times it got annoying because she would break things down to the simplest terms,but that's great for helping those who need to understand get it better.She's very helpful.My class was a bunch of babies.Rogers is a good professor.Slightly disorganized at times, but great in teaching the concepts.

    Enough &quot;She doesn't know how to teach&quot; ****.  One kid asked if we could only do odd numbered homeowork problems because of the answers in the back of the book.  Maybe you just suck at math.  If anything, Prof. Rogers tried too hard to simplify things for a bunch of babies that didn't even try. If you OPEN THE BOOK, you'll do fine. Really. Easy.

    I agree with everyone.  Herway of explaining math is...well she can't explain it.  She makes mistakes on the chalk board all the time and her mind is disheveled.  She probably won't know your name and she is an okay grader.  Get a tutor.

    This teacher doesn't know how to teach a math class.  She's not exceptionally 'hard' but if you haven't taken a college level Algebra class before, don't take it with her because you'll be totally lost! She's smart, but doesn't know how to explain things simply. She let us use a notecard for the final which REALLY helped! Keep up with the homework.

    A very good professor indeed. Not A+ quality but def above the rest. Midterm is harder than the final, other than that, the homework is easy. I agree that just doing your work and doing fine on tests will get you a B at least. She hosts a study session before the final which is VERY helpful. She has some dry humor in class, but easy to follow!

    im gunna have to give the Meh (shoulder shrug) to this teacher, she's easy in grading and her quizes and test are pretty easy, but she does not know how to teach at all.  The class is very easy, all you have to do is show up and do the hw and im pretty sure you'll end up with a B at least. It's just shes so boring and dosent explain things clearly.
