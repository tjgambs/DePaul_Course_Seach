    David is amazing. He gives great feedback on projects and is always willing to sit with you and give you extra helpattention on a project. My 3 hour class flies by because he makes it so fun and enjoyable! He assigns projects that actually help you develop as a designer. It has been 5 weeks and I feel much more confident than I did week 1.

    If you're a Graphic Design major, taking David for 105 is a must. As a working designer, he definitely knows what he's talking about and I've never had a teacher as passionate or creative with lectures. The workload is a bit heavy, but it's all relevant and fairly simple. He also gives tests every other week but they aren't too hard.

    David is awesome. He's really laid back, keeps lectures interesting, and you can really tell he's passionate about the subject he teaches.  I'm always surprised how quickly the 3 hour class I'm in goes by.  If you're interested in design you'll love his classes, and if you're not, he's probably still your best bet.  His class is actually fun.
