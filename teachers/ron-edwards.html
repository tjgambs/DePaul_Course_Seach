I hate science in general, so I didn't like this class at all. The teacher was cool and wasn't so strict on late work etc. Just don't overdo it. Only take him if you enjoy learning about biology in movies (not to be confused with watching Planet of the Apes in class).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>May be a tough class for some, but depends on your Bio background. He dispels a lot bio information you have learned. Although at times he states his leftist opinion most times, hes still a great guy to talk too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2012<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome!!! He's definitely a strange guy, but class is interesting. He genuinely wants you to do well and will do everything he can. Extremely fair, he's not out to trick you in any way. I hated biology in high school but because of taking his class I have started to enjoy it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2011<br>Class Name: BIO256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor.

This guy is the man. Great dude and real nice. Easy class but the only thing is that I think he is too smart. When explaining material he can play with his words to make things sound more complicated but he knows his stuff. Highly Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2009<br>Class Name: BIO435<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A knowledgeable professor with an enthusiasm for his discipline.  That was great.  However, his teaching is extremely scatterbrained.  He also brought his baby to 7 classes throughout the quarter!  While his child is adorable, an infant should not be brought to our classroom.  This was extremely distracting and unprofessional!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2009<br>Class Name: BIO305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Edwards is great. His lectures can be tricky because of how he words things, but his devotion to his student's success is unbelievable. He really wants you to get it. I can't say enough about how helpful he is. His tests are totally fair, and doesn't do anything to trick you. He's such an awesome guy. Really helpful, really nice. Good prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: BIO256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Edwards is a really interesting guy who is clearly excited about Biology and teaching it. He didn't dumb anything down for the nonmajors class, but he didn't try to cram us with equations or technical facts, either. Try not to miss labs and be sure to ask lots of questions. Laid back atmosphere, cool guy, great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS FOR NEW DEPAUL FRESHMEN!

I'm no prude, but he loves to use nasty examples like &quot;crop dusting****&quot; and &quot;deceptive fertility in human females&quot; REPEATEDLY. Also, profs using the n-word is not acceptable anymore, esp. in a Bio class! Attendance not required, easy class besides his antics!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2006<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was great. He's the only person I know who can teach a class about rats and make it relative to every aspect of life. I loved Rat's Eye View. He is by far my favorite professor at DePaul.

Though very bizarre.  He's a cheerful guy, and fairly reasonable.  It goes really quick, so, from personal experience, I would say don't miss too many classes.  He gives very little homework of any kind.  Just two big group projects that aren't nearly as hard as he makes them sound, just very important grade-wise.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2005<br>Class Name: BIO256<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>what is there to say&#63; he is a hard grader and u have to def work for your grade. do not expect to get As on any labs or presentations, very hard grader. 2 tests, not as hard as u think, but he is very hard to understand, he tries to prove his intelligence during his lectures that no one gets. good for lab or quantitative, just work ur butt off</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2005<br>Class Name: BIO155<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my required lab class and overall I would recommend it. Professor Edwards is not clear in his assigniments or in labs and he often takes off points for every little mistake. The class consists of four exams and a bunch of small labs. He didn't count attendance but in the end you have to attend to get points for the labs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: BIO256<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class sucks.

He is very knowledgable and interesting. He is very picky when it comes to lab assignments and homework. Be as complete and accurate as you can be. This was a summer course. We had lecture, several in class labs, and outside homework was a few short papers. Midterm and final is multiple choise. Would highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Edwards is a really intelligent guy, and knows just as must about film theory as biology.  Focal point was unique and the subject matter was interesting, but I didn't do readings once and got an A.  Erratic grader, hard to read how he's thinking, but I'd definitely recommend him to anyone interested in movies or bio (or martial arts).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: ISP12063<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Movie biology class.. had NO idea what to expect.  The class was a bore, you could make do w/ just his handouts and common sense.  We joked that he stuffed his crotch. But- you do pick movies you have a passion for and its an easy A.
