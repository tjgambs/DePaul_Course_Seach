His tests are extremely fair, meaning he tells you what you need to know and the depth at which to know it, and that's what he tests on.  Learned a ton from doing the homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2015<br>Class Name: SE450<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Knows his stuff, and wants everyone to learn. Generally good at answering questions, in class or over email. That being said, the course-long project did not match up all that well with the actual course content in some ways. Exams are hard but fair. You'll learn a lot, but have to work hard, and be prepared to teach yourself some stuff. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: SE430<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Echoing other reviews here.  Good lecturer, tough grader.  He was a bit harsh a couple times, but overall this was a pretty good class that I learned a lot in.  Assignments are graded a bit harshly, a couple questions on midterm were not really emphasizedcovered.  His peace offering of extra credit should help.  I'd take another one of his classes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2015<br>Class Name: SE450<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expectations are high yet lectures are hard to follow. He is a powerhouse in java. Lots of respect, but inflexibility did not help me learn any quicker. His course materials are excellent and will be a valuable resource. Friendly enough, and seems interested in student success. I would sign up for another of his courses.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2012<br>Class Name: SE450<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class has been a course about basic java,instead of what is claimed:OBJ-ORIENTED SOFTWARE DEV.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2012<br>Class Name: 211000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor, he is a beast with email response, tough midterm and time consuming assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to learn Java and really understand it.  Take Professor Hield! He knows his stuff and if you aren't sure ask him questions and he will guide you.  Be sure to study for the midterm it will trick you up, it caught me off guard!  But you will come out of this class knowing Java!  Be sure to analyze your own code :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2012<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher.  First CS course I've ever taken and am extremely excited to continue learning and satisfied with this course.  The subject is not easy and you must work very hard to comprehend but he will work with you.  Always quick to emails before midnight.  If you want to learn Java, learn from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2012<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A rly great teacher b/c he is very willing to meet work with you thru any problems.there were times that I did my homework last minute&had a problem but he worked w/ me after class& is overall lenient of the late policy.u rly have2kno ur stuff so study terms&try 2 become good at detecting little flaws in code.Hard to rmbr evrythinfor a 3 hour class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2011<br>Class Name: SE450<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hield is not the guy you want to learn design patterns from. He spends the first 3 weeks covering intro to java concepts. The quarter project is a space simulator where you'll waste time due to having to implementing his abysmal requirements instead of focusing on &quot;design patterns&quot;. Midterm/Final are semi tough. Skip this guy if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2011<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Very clear. Lectures directly relate to homework assignments. Homework instructions are clear and easy to follow. Very helpful with questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2011<br>Class Name: SE450<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy speaks Java. He knows the suject very well. Very helpful if you ask him.

His clarity on the homework are not very clear after the mid-exam. Does attempt to reply back to emails quickly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2009<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grades only if programs compile. So that means you would have to submit code that is mostly complete and correct, otherwise you receive no grade/rejected. Will not grade on what you already have done even if you did 90% of the assignment and spending time weeks back and forth with emails takes too long, with each week a late penalty is hit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2009<br>Class Name: CSC450<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His CSC450 is the best course I took at Depaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2008<br>Class Name: SC430<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not very responsive to e-mails.

Actually likes teaching. Assigned one major overlapping project that anything that you had a question on he went over, in depth, during class. Is incredibly helpful if you have a question. You can quite literally send him your entire directory and he will help you with your code.</div></div></div></body></html>
