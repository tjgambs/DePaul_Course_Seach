His lectures are just him reading his papers aloud to the class in a monotone voice.  The majority of the teaching was done by the students through the presentations.  His final was a surprise attack of 2 5 page papers after a 10-15 page paper and a presentation. Ridiculous.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2006<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't get me wrong, he is a very, very nice guy. Read, do the assignments, pay even a moderate amount of attention--and you'll do fine. However, he seriously did bore me to tears though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2006<br>Class Name: ENG228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is really nice, funny and overall pretty easy.  A few 1 page responses, a paper, a small performance and 2 tests.  The tests were not hard as long as you studied.  he is a great guy and makes Shakespeare fun!</div></div></div></body></html>
