She is a very easy teacher if you kiss her ass. Prof is a very opinionated woman that does not like hearing dissonant thoughts or opinions; unlike good professors. She is very passionate about what she teachers which is the only good thing she has going for her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: GER201202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Um, hm, scary. The classes are so small there are people with all different german levels. if your not in the top 3 she doesnt like you and is degrading.  She cares about her students, but due to her germaness she is blunt and it comes off as rude.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2005<br>Class Name: CPL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had no idea what she was talking about half the time, very unclear in assignments and lectures...tangential.

My language skills improved during the two courses I have had with her. Appreciative of hard work and not shy about telling you when she is disappointed. Wants her students to succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class sounded interesing, but what we did in class really had nothing to do with the class itself.  The books/plays we read our stuff she likes and really have nothing to do with the course.  Unclear when it comes to papers and holds the class to the very end.  Brutal class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: GER201202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not be fooled by the rating I gave her. She has personality issues. She openly humiliates people in class and through e-mails. Although she is very knowledgable and cares a great deal, I hate that, being a german major, I have little to no choice in any other professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very confused lady... i wouldnt take her if u have any ther choice for a focal point. She's brutal and u'll be there till the end of class EVERYTIME.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: GER202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2004<br>Class Name: GER103201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Rumold ist am besten! Einfach ausgezeichnet. See&#63; That's German right there. I 100% loved all the 3 classes that I took with her, and I only wish I could take more. If you want to learn German, or at least are willing to try, enroll without hesitation - you won't regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: GER201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Frau Rumold is an execellent teacher.
