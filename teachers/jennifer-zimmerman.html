Sometimes her lectures were boring and long but she usually did interesting in class activities and shows lots of videos about studies. Pretty straight forward with what she was looking for. Weekly quizzes, three short papers and two exams. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear lectures. Assignments were not hard if you put the work into them.  Somewhat helpful. Terrible at handling major academic concerns in class. Allows plagiarism without penalty in her classes. Very unsatisfied with her teaching ethics.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>I love her!!! She made social psychology very interesting. She basically lectures the whole time yet it is still fun and interesting. Would 100% take again! Also you only have 3 papers and two tests throughout the whole course it's very easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Zimmerman is a very sweet woman. She was always willing to meet with me when I was confused and made things clear within just a few minutes. She is a hard grader and the final project does involve putting in a good amount of work, but if you stay on top of the deadlines, you should get an A in the class! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Zimmerman is great. Her lectures are a breeze to sit through so coming to class isn't a drag, like some. She is funny and encourages participation with activities. The paper assignments in this class were not tough and were only ever 2 pages maximum, very do-able, especially if you're taking some tougher classes along with this one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2014<br>Class Name: SOCIALPSYCH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors at Depaul! Her lectures are very interesting and she keeps you engaged in the material. She is a very generous grader and the midterm and final exams are not hard, study the material and you'll be fine. She uses many examples in her lectures to explain phenomenas. If you remember those, the exam is easy. Easy essay grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2014<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I definitely recommend taking her online class. It was definitely do-able. She clearly laid out what she wanted for the assignments and projects. It was easy to finish assignments early, and she gives clear feedback. She also gives really good extra credit, which you should take advantage of. Take this class, you won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2014<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was a mistake taking this class online. I think if I were to take it in class, it would be much more manageable. The final project is insane. I feel she doesn't recognize this is an online course, and there needs to be adjustments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2014<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an amazing professor that cares about how her students are doing in class. You are allowed to bring a page of notes front and back to her exams. Need I say more?</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2014<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Zimmerman is a great stats teacher. She is clear and will stop to explain something in more detail until you understand or will offer to stay after class to help. You have to pay attention and never miss class. She is very accommodating and caring if personal issues arise during the quarter. You do need to study and I recommend finding a buddy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: STATSIIPSY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best stats professor ever!!!! She is very knowledgable and explains everything thoroughly! take her if you can! If you pay attention in class you do not need the textbook</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2013<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Dr. Zimmerman for Stats 240. I thought she was great! She really takes the time to explain the concepts in her notes and she puts them all on d2L. Our class has high averages for her exams. Not too much homework and she usually tells you ahead of time when assignments are due. Offers extra credit too! Great for stats!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/25/2013<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Zimmerman is by far the BEST Stats 240 professor at DePaul.  Yes, you will have to work...but c'mon people we are in college. Do you REALLY want information spoon fed to you? Anyway, she's extremely helpful and explains the material explicitly.  Unfortunately, she ended up not teaching PSY 340 which was a HUGE shame.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: PSYC240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is truly the best professor for math. I have a learning disability in math and I have an A in her class. She is so nice and so approachable as well and is PATIENT. I was scared of Stats and now am not because of her. She cares for her students and tries to make Stats as fun as possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2013<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best psych teacher ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2013<br>Class Name: STATS1<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think prof Zimmerman is a great teacher. She is willing to go over examples if you don't understand the material and the homework helps with concepts. If you study you will do well on tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Zimmerman is AMAZING!! I took her online course and it was so easy! All of the homework  has an example of previous homework from students with good grades so if you follow it to the T you can do well. Her notes are exactly like the material on the quizzes. Do the work, study! EXTREMELY HELPFUL.LOVE HER! Take This professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2012<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have had nothing but good experiences with this instructor. Her tests are hard, but fair, reflecting the READING material. Go to class, listen and read... Zimmerman is tough and you will learn in her class... whether you learn the hard way or not is up to you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2012<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her exams are not clear at all. If you haven't had her before prepare for a surprise because you will not know what to do and how to solve the problems the way she wants you to do.  Her PP presentations are not clear at all.  She expects you to be detailed and if you are not your homework will suffer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2012<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, everyone the extra credit she gives is just too much work.  If you want to write a 10 page paper than go ahead and do the extra credit.  She just says oh there is an extra credit, but than when you she the work you need to do for only 10 point is just insane.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2012<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is just a bad teacher.  I couldn√¢??t hear her voice anymore it was making me scream and run far away from her. So obnoxious! Take her if you want to get a C.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2012<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a 2.6 teacher but is grading as she is a 4.0.  Do not take teachers that score bellow average. You deserve much better than that. Her online class is disaster.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2012<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst decision I√¢??ve ever made in my life is to take this teacher. She is not involved with students and very disorganized. Ruined my GPA.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2012<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2012<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think her methods are fine, I've always been bad at math and failed a statistics class in the past. I was able to learn and understand the concepts and her examples really helped. I learned a lot in the class. As long as you don't miss class and take good notes you'll do well</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2011<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow. I don't know what prompted the rest of these comments.  Dr. Zimmerman is one of the best professors I've had.  Her teaching style is effective and clear.  She is very helpful and a fair grader. There are 5 HW assignments, 4 labs, and 3 exams.  The lowest HW and lab are dropped. It's not a blow off class by any means, but come on, it's Stats 2.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Warning: based on my experience, this teacher will screw you over.  Seriously, don't expect ANY slack from her.  She won't care what your circumstances are, or at least that's how she came across.  Way too strict and unfair, in my opinion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2011<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I've had at DePaul.  She's not helpful at all, even when you ask.  She just rips your work apart in a non-constructive manner, takes a million points off assignments for even the smallest mistake, and makes you feel stupid.  I would not recommend this professor to anyone, not even my worst enemy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2011<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you actually want to understand statistics, DONT TAKE HER! In class examples are lacking and dont expect to look back into your notes for help bc it will make no sense at all.  Shes all over the place when teaching and doesnt help you understand how to do things step by step. Easy grader but you will learn absoltely NOTHING!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2011<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Way too hard and mean. If she decides that she doesn't like your work, she will give you an F regardless of how hard you worked on it or how much you thought you knew about the topic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2011<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unfair grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2010<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is very strict. don't expect any slack of any sort. I can't watch Liz Lemon from 30rock because it reminds me of her and I start to have a panic attack. it was the only show I watched</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2010<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Warning! most of these reviews are from graduate students. in fact for 240 she is horrible. you must the the material like a professional or you fail. this prof. in class she said that an average of 70 was normal for the midterm, extremely hard test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2010<br>Class Name: PSY342<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice but the class was a lot of work. Wrote multiple lab reports which were often not explained well, with very harsh grading and high expectations. Also there are no &quot;easy&quot; points...you have to work for every point you earn so if you want an A don't miss a thing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2010<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! I struggle with math and she made statistics II so clear! She explains things extremely well. Come to class, pay attention, do the work, and you will do great in the class! I would definitely recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy going class. Mid Term and final are extreme difficult but she gives extra credit throughout the course. Expect a paper and test every week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2009<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes so nice and takes it slow and explains very well. I had an awful teacher for stats 1 and was really worried for 2. You can tell that she really cares about you doing well. there are 3 tests and you are allowed a cheat sheet which helps to remember things. Take her. Highly recommend</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Zimmerman is in fact a very good teacher, a far cry from my last stats professor. She manages to make a subject like stats easy to pick up on, and she works well with students. Textbook was hardly used. Still, despite her superb intellectual and social skills, all I could think about during class was how much she looks like Felicity Fey.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2009<br>Class Name: PSY347<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Spends more time using the class on experiments than teaching, expect to read a lot from the book!  Puts her notes on blackboard so you dont have to take notes in class.  Quizzes every week, 3 tests, papers, but also gives extra credit</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2009<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Zimmerman knows how to teach! Plus she is sexy!!! Goes slow with each chapter (except for the two week review period of all the other stuff). All in all, she teaches the subject well and assists anyone who needs assistance. Two thumbs up!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: RM2<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Zimmerman is a good teacher, class is fairly easy, however she grades kinda tuff, but she does give alot of extra credit opportunities, DO THEM! you'll regret it if u dont.  you could a paper that in your mind is perfect, and she'll find every imperfection!! Nice lady though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2008<br>Class Name: PSY242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice if you get to know her, pretty strict, though.  Doesn't hand out easy grades to everybody, you have to work for it. She is very young (grad student), but a very talented professor.  I highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had to take the quant. reas. class as a requirement, but ended up enjoying it and learning a lot.

Definitely take her if your a psych major because she'll teach in a way that you'll never forget stats!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2007<br>Class Name: PSY340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the easiest teacher ever. I took her for Stats II and she explains everything so well that it's impossible not to understand. You don't need a book at all and there are 3 exams that are super easy. Take her, shes awesome at teaching and you will actually be interested in what she's saying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class in general. ISP 120 Math and Technical Literacy. If you know Microsoft Excel you will do fine. All the homework is in Excel. You have weekly homework that is like 5 problems. 30 minutes tops.
