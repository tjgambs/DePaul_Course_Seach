I personally thought the class was boring...but i don't like philo.  He's an easy grader...and I didn't deserve the B I got because I slacked so much.  And I know of others who got easy grades too.  lots of reading and a couple papers....but also very understanding and smart.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2005<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him for PHL 100 and I took his class again because he is such a bad ass teacher. His lectures are very interesting, he is helpful, he explains everything you need to know, answers any question you have. Get involved in class and he will notice you and help you even more on questions you may have.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best teachers here at DePaul. He knows exactly what he is talking about. Class grade is determined on papers, but he allows a great amount of range when writing them. He is very helpful, and class was very enjoyable. I had never taken a philosophy class before, and he really sparked my interest.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you can't write papers for this class, YOU SHOULD NOT BE IN COLLEGE!! This Prof. is great! I had him a while back and if you do the reading (Yes, it's quite a bit but interesting material that makes you use your brain)and go to class, you will be fine. He's really HOT too,but married.oh he's hot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved his class and I'm not at all big on PHL. The reading is actually rather interesting. If you do the reading, go to class, and put a little effort, you have to be an idiot not to get an A. Plus, he is HOT. Very good teacher, but you need to earn your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good professor.  His class requires a lot of reading, but it's fairly interesting material (if you're into philosophy). Beware, he is a stickler for grammar! He's also quite attractive...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am taking 4 classes and by far, I got the most out of this one. it wasn't very appealing at first, but he made it very interesting. he knows how to teach and cracks jokes that will make you laugh. when it comes to grading, he is really strict on midterms and finals.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>wow---extremly hard grader for a core req. class.

He has a Dr's in PHL and thinks everyone should too.  Too much reading but he does know his stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was kind of tough, and involved alot of boring reading, but lectures were good & he's a great teacher. Really knows his stuff. Few easy quizzes if u paid attention. MidTerm & Final papers, tough grader. Overall a fun class. He makes boring old philosophy fun & interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2005<br>Class Name: PHIL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring and way too strict on papers.

He is the best professor for PHL 100. Explains wells, no tests, just take home essays/ papers...Emails back quickly..totally understanding and so funny. Very interesting class, low homework load, and easy, I mean easy, quizzes. Take him!PS we called him Zorro.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>let me say, im taking him as a night class. the class isnt bad, but the books are unimaginable. do not take him if you want an easy class--would not take him again- write 2 papers = final grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very clear with what he was explaining. Used examples from things today to relate to the material. Willing to help if you come to him with questions. Read the homework and you're fine. Definitely recommend this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2005<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>philosophy is just hard but he tries to help you and is accepting to alternate views and dude he looks like zorro</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/10/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard grader on the papers!! Bland readings.  VERY VERY REPETITIVE. He explains material well, but with him repeating everything the class becomes unbareable.  I thought I enjoyed philosophy B4 his class, but I dislike it now.  I wouldnt take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The reading material is horrible and hard to understand. I ended up doing Sparknotes on the first two books and I didn't read the last book. I wrote my mid-term paper based on my notes and got an A-. For my final I turned in my mid-term with a couple new pages on the new material and got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>interesting lectures at times, although repeatative...but a lot of dry reading and papers, he really expects you to understand the material perfectly</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is actually interested in Philosophy.  You will learn a lot, if you go into this class with an open mind.  Just 2 papers, and a few quizzes and short writing assignments.  He wants to help you grasp the concepts, which makes the learning experience better.Overall a good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If anything is boring, its the class, but he tries to explain everything. Only like 3 or 4 quizzes and essays. Two big papers, mid & final. Just write everything he said in class. Take good notes! Take him in small doses, MWF. If you must take PHL 100, he isn't a bad choice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! There is quite a bit of reading, but he explains it so well and makes it interesting. If you come to class and pay attention, you'll get an A. He's cute too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is hot!!!

Drink coffee and eat breakfast if you have an early class-you really have a hard time staying awake. He tries really hard to make it so you can connect to the material, which is nice. Hes willing to help on papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class but he's nice.  Tries to be funny.  Papers are kind of difficult.  His notes are confusing.  Willing to help with final paper. I don't see how the books we read had anything to do with business ethics though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2004<br>Class Name: PHL200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>2 papers, midterm and final.

Lectures the entire class, every time. If you don't like philosophy, find a different professor. Nice guy, but common...these guys are dead, not that exciting !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he explains the material very thoroughly.  i didn't read one thing in that class, but i did well on my papers because i took really good notes.  just make sure you go to class and take notes.  he may seem boring, but it's because the subject's boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: PHL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor. I like him a lot. He's not too boring(although philosophy is a boring subject). He is willing to explain everything and can be funny too once in a while.

He assigns 2 big papers and they're rather hard to write. Grades hard. When you write a paper, write what he wants 2 hear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>every lecture and reading hardly made sense, but if you take notes of everything he writes and the board and elaborate on them for your papers you will do just fine. Participation helps also.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2004<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So cute!
