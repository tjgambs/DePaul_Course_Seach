He is such a caring teacher and truly wants his students to succeed!  He really knows his stuff when it comes to piano, but doesn't have a big ego about it at all.  He is great at teaching beginners and people with little to no experience.  Very approachable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2013<br>Class Name: MUS123<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is so chill and laid back. I swear he reads off the same script every class. He is an incredibly easy grader and even helps you out on every quiz if you miss things (which is hard to do). If you have no piano experience, you'll still do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2012<br>Class Name: MUS223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You know you suck at piano if he gives you a B.
