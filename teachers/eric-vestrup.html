    Vestrup is a great guy.Very easy!Teaches straight from the book and 50% of grade is midterm, 50% is final.All problems come from homework that he doesn collect.If you do the homework, you'll do well on the tests.Doesn't care if you come to class.Very funny as well.I enjoyed his class.

    The easiest, laziest professor I've ever had. Take his class if you want to breeze through calc without having to work but not if you really want to learn. That said, he does do a good job of clearly explaining the basic concepts.

    Midterm and final are fifty percent.  Never collects homework or takes attendance.  However, the test questions come right out of the homework.

    the most easy math teacher I have taken in my entire life. Two exams:midterm and final. you are not required to attend classes, there is no colected homework. You have to do the homework only for the exams which are DIRECTLY!!!taken from the book. He will not keep you interested in class lectures.

    How easy is it when he teaches from the book, only gives U the easy problems, and e-mails U what every problem on the test is going to be&#63; He reminds me of Mike Myers the way he looks but he is one of theeasiest math professors that you'll ever have

    funny guy.  laid back, tries to make calculus somewhat lively.  exams are very basic because he focuses on only the basics.  he emails you before the exam and tells you what each problem will be like.  easy A if u listen.  take him if just want the grade.

    He is a horrible, miserable man who wants everyone to feel as bad as he does. He is lazy which makes his class easy.
