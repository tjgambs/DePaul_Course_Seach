The class is about meeting deadlines. You must attend class and be on time or points will be lost. Other than that, it's easy and you will learn some vaulable business skills. Final was based group project. Take her highly recommended, and if you do everything like she says you should have no prob getting an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2010<br>Class Name: MKT376<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is super nice but sometimes unlear. Long lectures but lets out early once in a while. A lot of group work which is very easy. If you miss more than 2 classes for any reason you'll fail the class. this is the only rule i found ridiculous, but otherwise an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/26/2006<br>Class Name: ADVERTISING<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>her lectures are dull and uninteresting. The midterm was easy (short paper) but her final was really frustrating. She doesn't really prepare you for it, its just random stuff from the book. Could've been a lot better class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2006<br>Class Name: CMN244<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really nice lady, and helpful, but kind of unclear.  I feel like I didn't take all that much knowledge out of the class.  Midterm, final, group presentation at the end of the quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2006<br>Class Name: CMN244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice and caring teacher, very passionate about the subject with an effective teaching style. Her grading system and the assignments issued are a bit unclear. But she is wiling to help if you ask for further assistance. The class is engaging and though-provoking. You are not likely to get an A but you will learn plenty, which's worth more.</div></div></div></body></html>
