But the execution of the course in the classroom was not the best. The class was not engaged in the topic, for the mostpart, and Leahy was fighting a losing battle. This should have been a course that WOWED!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy needs to retire.  Lectures are boring and half the time he can't hear your question so you have to ask it 4 or 5 times to get an answer.  Just remember to respond to questions word for word and you've got it made.  Do NOT try to think for yourself - you will fail!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated this class. It's extremely boring. The lectures allow you to feel time actually move. It's also a lot of common sense with a lot of attention to the small details you'll never need to know. He definitely has his favorites and bases most of his grading on that. Horrible. Stay away from this.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will be confused; things are unclear at first, but you go over the same stuff so eventually you will get it.  If you're on his good side, you're set.  If not, you're screwed. Some people's papers are given As, the same kind Ds and Fs.  Not sure why. A gamble.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: MGTREL228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice older guy, clear lectures, gives handouts with main points and if you study those and attend class regularly you should do good.
