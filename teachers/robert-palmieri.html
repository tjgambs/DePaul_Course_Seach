Bob will give you what you put in. Come to class and be interested. Don't take this as a blow off, you'd just be insulting him as well as people interested in Jazz. He will open your mind to Jazz. Best class at DePaul if music is your liking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2007<br>Class Name: APS429<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bob is one of the rare individuals who is able to help advanced students focus on the small details that separate professionals from a dillettantes. His powers of intuition rival clairvoyance. He is the best teacher I have ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2006<br>Class Name: MUS247<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned way more from bob than I would have learned from a book about jazz.  He's awesome and is so passionate about music.  Im pretty much in love with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: JAZZ<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The other ratings are from music students... This is not. He is a hilarious guy, but not the best teacher. I would definately say he is eccentric and a bit off-kilter. Also, some of the kids in the class should be put out of their misery. Pretty easy all-in-all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2005<br>Class Name: JAZZGUITAR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bob is awesome.  I learned more in one quarter of jazz guitar than in years of HS big bands.  He is very informative and works hard to make you a better musician.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: JAZZGUITAR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2004<br>Class Name: JAZZ<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bob is awesome.  So chill, so hilarious.  The book is great too.  Even though I've been playing jazz for years now, I still found it very helpful.

If you are really into jazz then take this class. The book is helpful, especially for people who do not know a lot about the technical musician stuff. Also he and his band performed in class one day. Hella Cool!</div></div></div></body></html>
