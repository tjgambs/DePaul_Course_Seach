Taught myself everything cuz im a finance/acct major, but the book can only go so far. Yes there is open book for everything but the first quiz, homework is easy at first but gets extremely hard later on. Also handed in most of the homework late and still got an A but got a hundred on all quizzes and tests</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! 2 quizzes, midterm and final, and some homework-everything is open book. I am a fin major and I learned a lot in the class.You have to put efforts and spend some time studying. He gives a lot of real world examples and I found that very helpful and practical. Highly recommended even for finance majors!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The teacher is a really nice guy, he means well, but his class is ridiculous. It's definitely an easy A and the quizzes and tests are open book. As a finance major, I would not recommend him because you won't learn anything. His classes are torture but if you can bear through the pain, your GPA should receive a nice boost.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Professor is nice but he makes the material boring as he only reads from powerpoint slides. He doesn't work out the problems in class. Even though the exams are open book, you are on your own with homework and practice problems. He rarely went over any homework or practice problems we could not answer. If you need help, go to the tutor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2009<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All i can say is just dont take him.Especially FIN 310 is your first finance class then no...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Finance majors should not take him since you would not get to learn the basic finance. All his quizzes and exams are open book. The class was pretty boring since all he did was read powerpoint slides. I wish I had taken someone else eventhough I got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a joke.  It was his first time teaching in the US and he clearly had no idea what he was doing. 2 or 3 easy quizzes. Mid-term and final are open book open note. I went to class 5 times and left half way through and still got an A. Take him if you dont need basic financing explained to you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he was a really good teacher - you people that are posting the negative comments are probably just upset because you did not do well/put any effort into the class.  I would take another class with him any day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>night class is terrible. couldn't stay awake with him just reading pointless slides. midterm was the hardest test i've ever taken class average was 65% but offered extra credit and reformated final bc we did so bad. ended with b- . no clue how</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2008<br>Class Name: FIN100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great teacher, used lots of real world examples which made the class much more interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2008<br>Class Name: FIN3120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Reads powerpoint slides that come along with the book for teachers. He doesn't do any problems in the class and expects you to do loads of homework on your own without any help from his side. Exams are quite long. I feel like committing suicide right now:(</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2008<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He reads from his Power Point presentations. Tries to give examples from real life, but exams and homeworks are straight problem solving. If you ask him how to solve the problems, he won't be able help you...Exams and Quizes are open book, but it didn't help for more than half of my class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2007<br>Class Name: FIN310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is terrible!! his lectures are not understandable. the midterm was really hard. the only good thing is that he curves but it hasn't helped me at all.</div></div></div></body></html>
