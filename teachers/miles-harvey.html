He is one of the most easy-going people, with an incredible amount of knowledge on the world of Literature.  He's someone I would feel comfortable with going to if I had a problem that wasn't school related.  All around great human being.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2014<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>As an English major, I dreaded coming to this class every day.

The classes are not boring since they mostly focus on in depth discussions on the readings. There are two major papers which are basically literary analyses. There are quizzes every class over the assigned readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I highly recommend Professor Harvey's prose class. Our class discussions were engaging, and the readings were (often) enjoyable. As for professor Harvey, he was a kind and funny guy whose mellow attitude never intimidated me. You can't go wrong taking his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2014<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>As an English major, I have never disliked an English class as much as I did this one, with this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2013<br>Class Name: ENG221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! Really interesting guy and he's really passionate about English and writing. We always had great discussions in class. There are a couple novels you need for the class, but for the most part you read short stories online. Two papers, one midterm test that's pretty easy.</div></div></div></body></html>
