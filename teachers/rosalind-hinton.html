However she is willing to help with anything you dont understand.  Make sure you do the readings because she will call on you! She went around and asked about 10 people the same question, no one knew haha, because they didnt read.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: REL209<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is VERY by the book, meaning, she takes attendence every class, counts how often you come to class late.  She's unorganized, not very helpful, expects students to put together huge projects with little help.  She expects students to do to many things during the course of her class.  I would NOT recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2006<br>Class Name: ISPMULTICULTUR<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the devil! I'm not joking. One of the tests everybody except two people failed, that says something about your teaching. Made everyone redo their annotated bib's because she didn't explain it to begin with. Insulted people during their presentations. Didn't except your own opinions. One of the worst teachers I have EVER had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2006<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interested in the class. Papers (including final) are somewhat easy, but the midterm's another story...Nothing bad to say about her. As for the &quot;feminist remark&quot; from another rating (3/7/05), well, I'd like to slap you for saying that's a good thing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2006<br>Class Name: REL215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her expectations are very clear, but her lectures do not adequately prepare you for the tests. We were called to draw from class notes and discussion, and it was difficult to do so, as we went of topic. A LOT! Hinton was MORE E than willing to help with anything that was necessary! All in all, I would recommend her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a complete headcase.  Throughout the entire quarter I had absolutely no idea where I stood grade wise.  I found out at the and that I got a C, even though my lowest grade on a paper/test was a B&#63;  Do not take here, ever!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: REL215<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was very unclear about what she wanted. She changed the objections of the course. But if you talk to her she will help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2005<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so unorganized, impossible to understand assignments. entire grade based on huge impossible super complicated project that will ruin you life for a while. run away. i got an A and it was still the worst class ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2005<br>Class Name: REL263<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hinton teaches interesting material, assigns quality readings and leads spirited discussions. Is a decent lecturer, but only when working from notes. Is sometimes inarticulate, struggling to impart sophisticated concepts. Has serious weaknesses re: organization, which sometimes result in lack of clarity and continuity.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: AMERREL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a pisser, alright, but one of the most challenging, intelligent, and inspiring teachers I've had. A lot of people don't like her because they don't like being pushed. Well that's how you learn, and I learned a lot from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2005<br>Class Name: SOPHSEM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you go to class and participate you will get at least a B.  She is very helpful if you don't understand something.  The mid term and final were take home.  When I didn't understand an essay on the mid-term she kept e-mailing me until I understood (she basically gave me the answer). She may seem tough at first, but it really nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2005<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not sure what I think of Rosalind. She's definitely interesting, and if you participate in class, she'll make it worth your while. The paper assignments were pretty pointless but easy. I bumped into outside of class a few times, always knew who I was, and is just a genuinely nice person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Afr Am Rel.Had my reservations at 1st,but she turned out to be wonderful.Passionate,intelligent, and genuinely interested in facilitating her students' intellectual growth.Upstanding woman.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2005<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to spend an entire quarter trying to figure out what the class is supposed to be about pick this one.  Majority of class had nothing to do with religion leaving many students frustrated.  Erratic grading; on one assignment majority of class got same exact grade.  Take a different class!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very 50/50 on this teacher. She's a feminist, which is awesome, but very unclear. She didn't grade a paper of mine because I had too many typos(4) yet she has at least 3 on all assignments posted on blackboard. you really need to make alot of time to do the readings. strayed from rel, but that's OK!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2005<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I will never take another class with her! Very condescending and superior attitude portrayed in class. Strayed from religion on a daily bases and had specific favorites. How do you get a zero on a 5-7 page paper&#63; All I'm saying is obviously the professor is not communicating very well with students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She may be very hard to understand sometimes, and introduce topics in class that are irrelevant to the course, but she is very caring, and if you show effort and try to contact her outside of class, she will give you the A that you work hard for.  Make sure to do all the readings to answer questions</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my favorite class so far at DePaul.  She is passionate about her work.  She may come off mean but if you participate in class and ask for help she will help you.  She tells you exactly what she's looking for and is open for opposition to her beliefs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE! she did not know at all how to explain how she wanted the papers done!! NEVER TAKE THIS PROFESSOR FOR SOPH. SEMINAR! everyone dreaded going into that room every mon and wed. she grades HARD and she leaves very RUDE COMMENTS on the feedback of the papers AND especially the GROUP PROJECTS!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: REL215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows her stuff and is definitely passionate about what she teaches and believes. She welcomed different opinions in class, tho. Keep up with the reading and you'll be fine. I learned tons about Afro-American religion. The class had a hist bent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: ISO201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The biggest feminist teacher I have ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2004<br>Class Name: REL211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I disagree with most of these comments.  She is an easy grader but you must know how to formulate a valid opinion to do well in her class and read material you will do fine.  I have had 2 classes from her and got an A with minimal effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is by far the worst one I have come across in 2 years.  She presents material in a very biased fashion, FORCING people to agree with her opinions, grading with factors irrelevant to the assignment, confusing, belittling... HORRIBLE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2004<br>Class Name: REL215<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I totally disagree! She definitely knew what she was talking about regarding her subject matter. I will agree that there is a lot of reading however they were interesting and she gave the class ample time to complete assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: SOPHSEM<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY difficult and very opinionated. Belittles students and talks a LOT! Likes to make you feel dumb. VERY hard grader without explaining herself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: REL211<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This has been the worst teacher I have had at DePaul. She does not know what she is talking about and the class name has nothing to do with the class discussions. I wanted to leave every single time I walked into her class!! She is a hard grader. AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2004<br>Class Name: REL211<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BLAH!!! This woman does not teach well. She belittles her students - not so much fun - and her class didn't even discuss things it was supposed to. Ex: name of class&#63; American Religious Experience. what we learned&#63; not that.</div></div></div></body></html>
