You literally have to beg for help and attention. Be ready to read my friend. Please be as clear as possible in the essays. Pop quizzes on the readings. He does not only quiz you on the reading from the night before but he quizzed you on previous chapters. Participation is mandatory for a decent grade, I promise.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lets you use your notes during the Midterm and Final so be sure to read and take quality notes. Be prepared to think critically and pay attention during class. If you do so it'll be an easy A. Definitely would take him again. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2015<br>Class Name: COM102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Peter is one of the best instructors at DePaul!  He has a great deal of passion for the material and you must be ready to critically think.  I was not sure I would like him initially; however, after a couple of weeks that changed.  You will need to read the homework chapters, to pass the quizzes.  Pay attention and participate and you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Peter is an amazing professor! He assigns 2 long papers, but all you really have to do is answer the question he asks (which are a lot & easy) and you will have your paper done. All he wants is for you to critically think. Everyone in class would get A+ on papers bc they answered every question. Besides this he really cares and knows his stuff!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2015<br>Class Name: COMM102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A funny guy BUT would not recommend his class to anyone.  He spends the 90 minutes attempting to stretch out what little content he came prepared with. The quizzes were difficult and not related to class content. Overall tolerable but not a desired atmosphere.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives a lot of reading homework because of the course. Take a lot of notes. Study all of your notes. The papers are easy and fun. He gives good feed back. The lectures are good but you NEED to participate. He usually always picks the same people to speak so just keep trying for attention. He is funny and makes the course VERY modern. It was ok.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Forster  is an amazing professor! I was a bit critical of his teaching style at first but now it has been 5 weeks and I thoroughly enjoy the class and look forward to it. We talk about real things in the media and watch lots of videos. There are pop quizzes but they are worth so little so don't stress. He really wants you to do well in class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely amazing professor. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Favorite teacher I've had so far. He's so funny. His quizzes are super hard but they aren't worth too much of your grade. He's great and makes the class 10x more interesting. I highly recommend. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2014<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor!  I honestly thought I hated him at first, but as the course progressed, I found that he ended up being one of my favorite professors!  He just wants his class to understand the material and will help you out and assign extra credit so that you will do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2014<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Forster is a pretty good teacher, but prepare to read a LOT. He doesn't ever lecture, they're more like class discussions about the reading you were supposed to do. He also gives 4 or so pop quizzes. But if you read, participate in class and do your homework assignments and papers, you'll be fine. He lays it out at the beginning of the year. </div></div></div></body></html>
