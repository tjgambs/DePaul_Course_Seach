    Great Professor. Wether you are a photography major or non major you will benifit from his class. Very understanding and makes class interesting! I took him in the summer, but he made those 3 hours fly by pretty quickly with interesting lectures and hands on methods of teaching.

    He shows you how to do the projects, and I liked the assignments. He talks quietly so make sure you are paying full attention because some of the questions on tests you will miss you don't. His class is a bit unorganized but he is easy to get in contact with if you need help.

    It's a bit annoying how he's sarcastic all the time and he has such a teeny voice like he's mumbling something. Not that even good looking either and his teaching style is just mediocre

    He is sometimes a little bit confusing but he is a really fun guy and none of his assignments are very hard. He's really helpful when it comes to photoshop. He understands that your not a professional photographer and even though he is incredible at it, he goes easy on your work.

    He is extremely good looking and has a great personality.  He would always joke around with the students.  The midterm was pretty simple and the projects can all be done in class. Easy grader.  I would recommend taking him for DC 125 if you can!

    Just fyi, you must have a SLR camera (no point&amp; shoots). Jinks is extremely laid back but still able to inform you about photography. Even if you haven't taken DC 125, this class is fun. Jinks is helpful if you have problem with any projects. I couldn't recommend enough! Take him if you can!

    He was a very easy and laid back teacher. It could be a bit livelier but overall Jinks did a great job teaching. You can tell he is very passionate about photography. It was nice to see photos through his perspective. He was very respectful of peoples opinions.

    Nice guy. Regardless of the amount of effort you put in, you'll get at least a &quot;B&quot; on the 4 projects you'll have (including final). Laid-back, at times almost boring. If you're having trouble with anything just go talk to him. Easy on the eyes, and his British accent doesn't hurt.

    Really cool British guy.  Easy class.  Midterm was easy, no final.  Four or five picture projects.  As long as you take some sort of picture with a digital camera you will do fine in this class. Take this class!!!
