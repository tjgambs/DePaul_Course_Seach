Responds to emails very fast, is extremely nice. Helpful if you come to him for it. Lectures tend to be dull, but I  do other homework at the same time and I'm able to pay attention. Really knows what hes talking about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2015<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Grice  makes mistakes from time to time... but he is actively engaged with class and answers specific questions. He will email ASAP if you have questions and explains things in detail. Chem at DePaul is tough... but Dr. Grice is incredibly helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2014<br>Class Name: CHE134<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grice is not only boring, but also very unclear. There was information on the test that he hadn't even discussed. Worst Chem teacher out of the three I have had at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2014<br>Class Name: CHE132<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's a hard class but it's not as bad if you read the book and follow along with him in class. Sometimes he makes mistakes but everyone makes them from time to time. If you have questions, make sure to ask. Be specific about what you don't understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2014<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>While Dr. Grice was unclear in class at times, I always felt like it was easy to go to office hours. He is better at explaining one on one when you have a specific question about something from class or Mastering Chemistry. Reading the textbook is a must. He expects that you read and teaches as if you know what he is talking about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2014<br>Class Name: CHEM130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dr grice was a poor teacher. he taught the board rather than addressing the class. his explanations were very unclear and vague. very difficult to understand his lectures. i had to work VERY VERY hard to get a low b.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2013<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chemistry is a tough subject and it doesn't help to have a sub-par instructor. He isn't rude or mean but he doesn't know how to teach. He can't effectively communicate and present material. It's as if he thinks everyone is a genius like him.The only reason I got a B was because of you-tube. I'd try to avoid his classes in the future.</div></div></div></body></html>
