He is one of DePaul's younger professors and understood that we all have 3 or 4 other classes in addition to his. Read the texts you are given and do the homework and you'll do great. Essays aren't too hard but he always wants to push students. Offered 3 extra credit opportunities.  </div></div></div></body></html>
