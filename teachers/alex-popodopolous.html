    Worst class taken at DePaul. Less clear on what Geopolitics is after taking the class. Worst lectures and no clear idea of where he was going with any case studies. Horrible professor. Don't take.

    Riveting lecturs. Amazing visuals. LOTS of work, but also lots of guidance. If you're serious about urban planning and geography this is the prof for you.

    I was in that class too. It was absolutely fantastic! A lot of work and rich in theory but that's why i'm in college. Dr. P was always available and helpful.The class though is NOT for lightweights!

    Best seminar I've taken! Finally, a course and a prof. that makes you think critically. One small complaint--most of the grade was based on the final project.

    Tough class but tought by an absolutely brilliant teacher. I knew nothing about geopolitics and current affairs and came out of the class understanding what's going on in the world. Take him for sure, but be prepared to work!

    Dr. P is a very very smart man.  He is the nicest guy you will ever meet and loves what hes teaching. He is terribly hard in grading,but is willing to give you many oppourtunities.If you interested in the subject &amp; willing to take a harder class go for it

    Great guy, and he will be among the hardest professors you will ever take. He will also be among the best you've taken and actually liked. It's without a doubt hard, but it's truly rewarding. If you want a REAL class, take his. You'll surprise yourself.

    Extremely smart man. Demanding so only take his class if you are ready to learn something.  Honestly provides a great learning opportunity.

    His class is largely based on the reading (which in most cases will be boring). His lectures are very slow paced, which make me want to fall asleep. I suggest not taking the explore class, unless you enjoy reading and history. Note: He is a nice guy.

    I had Dr. Popodopolous for two classes as a freshmen. He is very hard, and demanding but totally worth it. If you want to come out of a class knowing much more than when you came in take a class for him. May I suggest his class on the European Union.

    This professor is probably one of the smartest people you will ever meet. He does expect a lot of reading from students, but if you are interested in learning he's a great professor.
