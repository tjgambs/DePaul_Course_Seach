Although she didn't give much partial credit on exams, her exam questions, which  were much more calculation-based than theory-based, were not very difficult. Overall, Dr. Wolbach was the best professor I had in the gen chem sequence and I would take her class again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: CHE142<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: WD</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely terrible. I hated having her. Terrible at helping students. She is not very approachable. Do not take unless you are extremely good at Chemistry. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2014<br>Class Name: 204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is clear during lectures and gives many examples on different types of problems. Overall a great lecturer during class and definitely knows the topic. Exams are tough  but if you study you should be on top of your stuff and do well on them on top of the extra-credit she gives out occasionally. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2014<br>Class Name: 138<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>She seems very strict and mean at first but that goes away within the first week. Her tests are very hard, most problems seen on exams have never been seen before. If you genuinely want to learn chemitsry take her class, otherwise it will probably be really stressful. She offers a lot of extra credit and curves the class too so it's not too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: HON225<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's awesome. Totally brilliant, helpful, and friendly. Class is always interesting. If you have the option, take her classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/02/2013<br>Class Name: CHE205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wolbach knows what's she is talking about. She is clear in class and is always available for questions. Not going to lie, her tests are extremely hard, but they are designed to push you to think critically about the problem, just like you would have to do in real life. Can come off as intimidating, but is really super nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2013<br>Class Name: CHE202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class over the summer. It was pretty easy. If you go to lecture, pay attention, and do all the homework problems, you should be good. She will test you on most things covered in class so make sure you review your lecture notes. The key to this class is knowing how to use/program your graphing calculator to solve statistics problems.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't really know why she is getting bad comments, she is seriously the nicest woman ever. She really cares about her students and creates opportunities to better your grade if you had a rough test. She prefers groups and gives extra credit for groups, but it's not mandatory. Pay attention and you'll do just fine :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2009<br>Class Name: CHE205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, I could not ask for a better teacher. She taught both Gen Chem and Quantitative Analysis, and she was always clear and organized in lecture and approachable outside of class. Granted, her tests were challenging and designed to push, but I feel that I am a better student because of her. Love this woman!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2009<br>Class Name: CHE205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Wolbach is extremely smart and will challenge her students. Nonetheless, she is always there to answer any questions whether it be pre-grade a lab report or answer a homework question. To do well in CHE 205/207, you better do all the assign problems and get the lab reports pre-graded with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is awful. If you can you should test out of it as soon as possible. She's nice but I found the homework to be hard and the activities to be aggravating. You do everything with a partner so make sure you get a person you like and is smart. The group activities are maddening. Take this class as a night class with a different teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2009<br>Class Name: CHE106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome. Super smart and explains things well. Granted I took a 100-level class, but it was very easy. I didn't have to study for her weekly quizzes and still did well. She's nice and eager to help. I would highly recommend taking her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2008<br>Class Name: CHE150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE!! AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS! SHE LOVES TO FAIL AND HAS NO TIME FOR HER STUDENTS.  VERY UNFAIR ON EXAMS.  WORST TEACHER IN MY LIFE!!! DEFFINETELY WORST TEACHER AT DEPAUL!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2008<br>Class Name: CHE321<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>...bit boring, dont like her teaching style.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2008<br>Class Name: CHE115<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wolbs is a chemistry titan. She is one of those people that knows how intelligent she is and makes you feel like an idiot when you ask questions. Her tests are 50% fair 50% stuff you have never seen before. She said that her tests are supposed to show that you have mastered the material.. not simply memorized it. Hardest class I have ever taken.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok... here's the rating on Wsquared.  She knows her****. Insanely smart geochemist and a nice/funny/nerdy woman... BUT if you're looking for an A you will have to work your ass off! and work really hard just to pass. we started the yr last year w/about 180 students and ended in the spring with 60 maybe.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2007<br>Class Name: CHE115<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is evil! She failed me and 3 others in class. loves to fail. Helps a little in office hours but she still cant explain it right. I really do not recommend taken her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2007<br>Class Name: CHE115<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She goes too fast. Does not slow down. Her tests are horrible. U need to study 500 hours day to pass her tests. Really what a horrible teacher. PLZ try to avoid!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Wolbach is a great professor. You need to study a lot for her tests to pass them with a satisfactory grade. If you don't study and do your homework, you will be lost in her class. I like her way of teaching because I learned a lot.Some people think that it is the most boring subject in the world, but I really enjoy it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2007<br>Class Name: CHEM113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall I think Dr. Wolbach is a hard teacher but if you study (a lot) you will be fine.  Her tests are very difficult and long and you need to know what's going on.  She is extremely helpful outside of class and helps you understand the material better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2007<br>Class Name: CHE106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is not easy, but Prof. Wolbach is so helpful and writes everything you need to know for the tests on the board in detail.  As long as you study hard you will do great in this class.  I recommend her, she's awesome!  A lot of people didn't like how she gives 1 quiz a week, but I think that really helps boost your grade and know the info.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2007<br>Class Name: CHE127<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I usually didn't bother with the text. I just went to class and did all of the homework.  Her explinations are very clear and she did tons of examples.  To all of the Gen Chem'ers (esp. complainers): did you go to class&#63; did you see the tutor&#63; did you do the homework&#63; I'm sure your exams were taken directly from the homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2007<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't even know where to begin! I went to every single class, and studying an inhumane amount of time and I still failed over half of the tests. The tests are all calculations and the numbers come out of nowhere. I would have been better off not wasting time studying. She is unavailable out of class, and encourages students to drop the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid taking her if you can.

DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2007<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very good with her lectures. However, her tests are extremely difficult. She has a nice and funny personality but does not cut slack to anyone. Truth be told, I came out crying after a few of her tests. I managed to pull off a C, and I'm an A student.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2007<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the people on here that all she seems to care about is her research. She really should just be a full time researcher and not teach. She never offers help even when you ask her because she has to do her research. Don't take her unless you plan on teaching yourself chemistry striaght from the book or you have taken AP Chemistry...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2007<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She only cares about her stupid research and doesn't care about her students at all. She rushes through everything and than rushes out. HORRIBLE! Her status as a teaching professor should be severly audited.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2007<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does not have a mean personality but she is very stern; she will try to help you if you ask.  However, I found the exams for her Chem111 class to be extremely difficult.    I would not recommend a student to take her class unless they were extremely good in chem.  The average for her final exam was a 55%</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is a nightmare come true.  DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS.  She is unwilling to help students outside of class and she doesn't care if you fail.  This teacher believes that it is normal for a class to recieve 40% averages on a test.  Trust me, stay away if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2006<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class sucked. she wasn't available to help, the SI thing was messed up. i hate chemistry.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2006<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I couldn’t disagree more with the previous post; yes, the class average was 42%, this is because material she covers in class is only half of her exams, the other half involves calculations or methods that were RARELY discussed in class. Don’t take any chemistry at DePaul, by far the worst department within the University; Wolbach is no exception</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2006<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best chem teachers in the department, she explains everything from the book notes are from the book. unfortunately last test was 43% ave. obviously ppl dont listen in class nor even show up. show up take notes and u'll be fine. a very dedicated teacher when it comes to chem. kinda dorky at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2006<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away! It troubles me that she finds it &quot;normal&quot; for a class to have a 40% average on her test. She crams in as much info as she possibly can into 1 lecture. She isn't willing to help outside of class, b/c she's too busy doing her research, even though over half her class is failing, which explains why over 1/2 the class dropped out. HORRIBLE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2006<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really isn't bad a teacher.. Don't listen to what other people are saying.
