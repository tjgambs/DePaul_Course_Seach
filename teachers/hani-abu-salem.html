For non-computer majors, the class is hard, but he works with you so much to help you understand the material. He's prompt with responding to your emails, and he will help you until you understand it. I've never had a more understanding professor. He's great! I highly recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2006<br>Class Name: CSC449<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hay guys, take his class.

And he truly cares about his students.. He wants to make sure everyone grasps the subject.  True, he can be boring, but guess what&#63; I only went to one class the entire quarter and I still got an A since his notes were online and he was eager to help out.  Great teacher!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow!

I would still recommend him since this class is easy A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2006<br>Class Name: CSC449<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor....awesome guy.

But if you have the patience to sit through the ten weeks you will get a good grade.  Although he loves to help students in and outside of class much of the things he says goes way over your head and you become overwhelmed but in the end the assignments are strait foreward and he grades easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2005<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy, very helpful and nice.  However, the quarter starts out as a major bore and people tend to fall asleep.  Also, he goes over things too many times and gets redundant.  Later on, this is a good thing, but for the simple things you learn in the first few weeks, totally unncessary.  great class though!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/15/2005<br>Class Name: CSC449<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best among all in DePaul. Nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class via distance learning.  I only watched 1/2 of the first lecture of this class.  Everything is very straight forward.  All you need to do is scan through the book to complete the assignments.  The final project and homework assignments are fairly simple.  He is also very accessible outside of class if you need any additional help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2005<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is so nice and patient and willing to help anyone. I reccomend him but not really this class unless you are a CTI major. The lingo and having no prior experience with the CTI program ACCESS was challaning. However, I think if you are a CTI major you will be ok. But as far as Dr. Abu-Salem goes, take him, he is great!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2005<br>Class Name: CSC449<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome professor, awesome guy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2005<br>Class Name: IT240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My advice to everyone &quot;take his class&quot;. All what he teach will benefit you in your work. He is the best.

Assignments were moderately hard and graded fairly. His biggest problem is that he's not fluent in English, but that rarely mattered in this class.</div></div></div></body></html>
