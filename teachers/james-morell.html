Assigns long, confusing research projects, and won't offer much insight into what he's looking for or how you can improve on what you have so far.  The quizzes take forever and are completely pointless. The life advice he would give  us made me feel like a high school senior again...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Capsim was stressful and "Coach Mo" doesn't always have the best advice to help you navigate it, but it's hard to blame him for that when the program is so complex. He's a good guy and truly cares. You can tell he puts effort into being a good instructor and he expects students to put effort into the course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2014<br>Class Name: GSB599<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Morrell's section of GSB 599 might require more work than those offered by other professors, particularly Frigo's (which doesn't even do Capsim), but you might get more out of it. Good guy who means well though his Capsim advice isn't always spot on.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: ICS395<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can conclusively say that Coach Mo was my favorite college professor. He's insightful into the business world, has plenty of experience to share with you, and will coach you with real-life decisions that you have to make. The class wasn't difficult, but CapSim was challenging at times. I'll remember him and his advice 'til the day I die.</div></div></div></body></html>
