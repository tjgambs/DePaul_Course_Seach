He is the best teacher I have ever had. Very clear on the material. His class is very interesting especially to those that are interested in learning about the ocean!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/25/2006<br>Class Name: PHY220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2006<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXTREMELY great professor! Fair grader. He is extremely knowledgeable and doesn't put you to sleep. You get what you put into the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2006<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests and Homework are easy and make up most of the grade. Final is basically questions from the quizzes. Easy class but he is tough on attendance. For each class you miss your attendance grade goes down one letter. Also he always says he'll cover later in the class & doesn't. Overall not too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2006<br>Class Name: PHY220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oceans was pretty easy, even sort of interesting.  89% is an A, tough on attendance.  Grade is mostly quizzes and homework, final isn't bad.  Worth taking as a science elective.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2006<br>Class Name: DYNAMICOCEAN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class so much. Take it for your SI elective if you want to learn something new in a class that is easy to do well in. Kaelin rocks some awesome ties, and is super helpful outside of class. Missed a quiz and helped me make it up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2006<br>Class Name: OCEANOGRAPHY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an okay prof. His knowledge of some basic physics principles is lacking, but he is very knowledgeable in his concentration. His class is fairly easy, 87% is an A. Tests are multiple choice and fairly straight forward. Homework is very simple and helps to boost your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2006<br>Class Name: PHY114<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>10 labs, 5 quizzes, final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: OCEANOGRAPHY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are torelable. Homework is fairly graded, Quizes are actually challenging, but ok. His lectures are pretty interesting but tends to go off in tangents. I missed a quiz and was very understanding and took time of his lunch to help me out, Good artist.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2005<br>Class Name: GEO225<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is easy, but is extremely boring, his lectures are difficult to stay awake to. YOU WILL FALL ASLEEP AT LEAST ONCE! There is no class interaction. If you ask a question, his response will be &quot;I'll discuss it later in the course&quot; which he never does!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's really super groovy. He makes awesome drawings on the board during his lecture and makes jokes that help you enjoy it if you're paying attention (and a lot of people didn't) It's a class where you have to do a medium amount of work but he doesn't go out of his way to make things hard for students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this teacher. Material can be difficult and lectures can be boring (he tries to lighten with humor), but no participation grade, doesn't take attendance, 4 homework sheets, 5 quizzes, final exam (no midterm). Just a breezy class and good if you need a requirement but aren't in any of the science degrees. Really nice guy and understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2005<br>Class Name: PHY220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy. Organized. Huge grade curve 85-100=A. I hate science and rarely went to class and still got a B. Drops the lowest quiz grade (though I heard he wasn't doing it anymore). No midterm, just 5 quizzes, 4-5 hmwk assignments, the final exam is word for word all questions from the quizzes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: PHY220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT! loved it and hated science before! interesting lectures and material, fairly easy quizzes and homework assignments, good curve, kind fellow for a teacher, recommend it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: DYNAMICOCEAN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was a good teacher.  He knows alot.  The grade curve is awesome.  I am taking his other class next quarter.  He is really easy and super understanding if you miss things.  All multiple choice/ T&F quizzes.  Take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2005<br>Class Name: PHY220OCEAN<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy.  You can tell he's really into what he's talking about.  Just come to class, take adequate notes, study a little, and do your homework and you'll get an A.  Doesn't take attendance and is the best prof. I've had so far at DePaul!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2005<br>Class Name: OCEANOGRAPHY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was almost unbearable, because of the teacher, not the subject matter.  He 1) mumbles, in an already acoustically bad classroom.  2) Does not believe in that global warming is serious problem.  But his lack of attendance policy is a plus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2005<br>Class Name: PHY220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good sense of humor, very kind, tricky quizzes but grading scale is good, gets you fired up about whatever he's teaching, great guy, soft-spoken, I recommend him for sure</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2005<br>Class Name: OCEANOGRAPHY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED HIM!  DePaul made a huge mistake letting this one go.  He was entertaining, engaging and clearly digs the subject.  I anticipated feeling bored in the class but ended up looking forward to it.  Quizzes are hard, final is all quizzes rolled into one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2004<br>Class Name: PHY120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice and fun guy. He wants you to learn something and to do well. Do your homeworks, take good notes, and you are prepared. I would absolutely take more classes with him, but hear he had to leave... lucky Loyola...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2004<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy teacher. The final was every quiz put into one exam. I never once opened my book and I got a B in the course.</div></div></div></body></html>
