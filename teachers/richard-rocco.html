He wants everyone to succeed in a difficult field (sales) and he provides you with so many business connections. He will be there to assist you in any way possible. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2014<br>Class Name: MKT385<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you can't get an A in his class you need to DROPOUT of school ASAP! He is approachable and willing to coach you! If you want to go into Sales/Marketing you should learn from the best. He has REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE and goes out of his way to help you network. The class was chill, few assignments and a project. Totally Manageable!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2009<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will hate case studies after this class. you basically get a marketing refresher the first two classes and then the rest are all case studies which you have to read and analyze every class. very boring, and work gets repetitive. He tries making it fun w jeopardy but doesn't help much. He is a good teacher tho so just get the class over with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2009<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very dull; a pure academic. Doesn't make the material come alive. Needs to provide an overall guidance on performing case analysis (no, not HBR cases).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: MKT359<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take him!  Class is discussion based, he hardly lectured at all.  Most of the work is group projects, a simulation game, no midterm, and a take home final.  You'll learn a lot from him.  No reason you shouldn't get at least a B in the class.</div></div></div></body></html>
