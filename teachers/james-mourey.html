He is helpful, easy grader, hilarious, enthusiastic, and has an outstanding personality. The sad thing is he only teaches MKT 310 at DePaul. I wish he taught more marketing courses as he is the most liberal grader I have come across at DePaul. Do your assignments and you would get an A. Enroll in his class for MKT.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2015<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Jim ruined my life. He taught me so much about marketing that  Im now too paranoid to leave my house. Im so afraid that a marketer is gonna approach me and ask if eating Chipotle everyday fulfills my physiological, safety, or love & belonging needs. 1 time he made us cookies-it was terrifying. How did he know we liked cookies?! Hes a wizard.
