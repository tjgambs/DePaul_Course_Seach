A rather rigid test grader, but lenient Essay grader. She starts to pick on you if you participate too often; she won't bother you if you don't want her to, though. She's a great pianist--you'll listen to her play a lot. A lot of reading. Take many notes and study them, and you'll pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Go to class, get the book, save money by buying an older edition (there all the same), study a little bit a day or two before each quiz and you'll get an good grade, its all about memorizing definitions of words like dynamics, pitch, symphony, etc.   this class really opened my ears to a new world of music i never knew existed. Good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2011<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>funny and very friendly. always willing to let you make up quizzes and assignments even if u dont have a legitimate excuse. class overall is boring though. she stands and lectures from book. memorize useless things the whole quarter that you wont rmr the week after. easy A though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2011<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Already miss this class. Natasa is the funniest teacher I've ever had. Love her european sense of humor! :) You'll have fun, trust me. Don't buy that expensive book. I had the 5th edition (required is this 12th I think) and it was the SAME material. Again, use ISHARE! Material is very easy and she's extremely lenient. Miss this class so much...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2010<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her! She is so helpful and talented.  The workload is not bad with 2 short essays, 5 quizzes, a midterm and final.  They are not cumulative.  She allows you to redo the essays and quizzes.  She sometimes extends due dates.  If you know music theory and history its an easy A, if not then you have to read the book a bit, but still a fair class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2010<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Bogojevich is great. Take her and she will take you to the world of music that you never imagined. She is very helpful. Most of all I loved her unusual sense of humor along with her amazing piano playing. I will remember this class as I never listened to the classical music before. This professor opened a new world for me. I'd recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2009<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall she is a good teacher. She knows a lot more about composers and classical music so if you want to learn about Rock and Roll or anything in the 20th century take someone else. Quizzes can be a little tough but she assigns papers that she grades easily. If you like classical music than take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2009<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's awesome. Take her. Will entertain you in every class. She's an amazing pianist and conductor. I went to her concert and she's on the much higher level than the class, still she's making everyone enjoying the classical music, even when the music is boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2008<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has an accent, and her english is sometimes funny by you can understand her. She is not hard at all. She's a fair grader and always provide a study for her quizes. If you study from the study guide you will pass the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2008<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher and very funny. Will surely keep you entertained during a somewhat dry class. She is very smart, but if you dont have a music background you have to pay attention. There are four or five somewhat difficult tests, but she is fair. Moved our final up a week because we didnt want to take it on the last day od classes.! Take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2008<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is different than I expected. I used to take piano lessons but that doesn't help at all. The material is straightforward and the professor tells you so many things, she seems to attend every opera and concert in the U.S and Europe. She's composer herself and the class is interesting. I'd recomend it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2008<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think the instructor changed her curriculum. Unless you have prior music knowledge you will study HARD to receive an A in this clss. If your not a music person do not take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2007<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, makes old music interesting and I actually feel I learned how to listen to all kinds of music that I never knew before this class. 4 quizzes, 2 research papers, midterm and final, tests are frequent and helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2007<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Bogojevich is awesome.  there is no reason y anyone should get less than a B.  Quizzes and tests are very straightforward and shes cool as hell.  I missed like 5 classes and still pulled an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2006<br>Class Name: MUS101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was fun, sometimes she was confused by our questions & jerks took advantage of that, however she was a very fair grader and actually made music interesting... the old music that is.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am taking this class, so far it's the most interesting class at DePaul. She has an accent but makes fun of it. Strange sense of humor but witty, she really knows all about composers and their private lives. Great class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a very easy class. Final was a little harder, but quizzes, midterm and papers realy easy. It's all based on listening.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a 100 course, yet this teacher was trying to make everyones life harder. Do not take this class, unless you want to work your #@$% off. I thought the class is going to be easy, but it turned to be harder than my 300 level classes. Bad teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>one of the worst teachers i've ever had, she read these ratings and decided that she was too easy of a teacher so she made everything harder, doesn't try to help anybody, i don't recommend taking her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2006<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has Eastern European accent, but its not bad at all.  Very easy class.  All material is taken from the book.  As long as you take a few notes and do a little reading, you should get an A on the quizzes and the exams.  Definitely not the most exciting class.  Do a lot of listening in class - focuses mainly on classical music.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2005<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Despite her accent she is a good teacher and an easy grader.  The classes get a little boring, but as long as you do well on you 4 quizzez and the final (which is straight reading from the book) you'll definately get an A. I would recommend taking this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2005<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was very easy. There was not much reading to do and as long as you read, there was no way you could not get an A. You could even get away with reading in class while the audio excerpts were being played. I liked the class, it was interesting and easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: MUS100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was the worst teacher I have ever had at DePaul. I thought this class was going to be fun, interesting, and easy, but she made it a living hell.</div></div></div></body></html>
