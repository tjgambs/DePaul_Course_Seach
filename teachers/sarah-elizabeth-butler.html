Doesn't accept other's ideas or opinions.  Turned an extremely cool Wild Chicago course (adventure in the city) into such a painful class after immersion week. Reads directly from a powerpoint.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Meh.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2008<br>Class Name: PSYCH240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's great. It's a flexible class, you get a week for each homework assignment, tests are graded on curves and she's very fair. Test aren't that difficult at all. She's very helpful and understanding- very willing to meet outside of class for help. Thought class can be a little boring, to be fair, it is Statistics. Go for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2008<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'd say one of the best teachers I've had at DePaul. I was barely in class due to illness, but she is very helpful, funny, and nice. She helps you understand. Homework is almost easy, tests are not very difficult and she shows you that Statistics really isn't that scary. Take her if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: PSYCH215<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would not take her again, I do not like her style of teaching. You can tell she hasn't been teaching long, doesn't make the class very interesting. But her exams and hw assignments are not very hard. Although she takes off silly points for the writing assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2008<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>absolutely horrible. reads off slides, no enthusiasm, assumed everyone in the class has had sex, always arrive late to class and keep students late. she required a $35 iclicker n only uses it 10 times in the entire quarter. clearly not ready to teach college students because she treats us all like little kids by talking to us like we're slow.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2008<br>Class Name: PSYCH215<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First of all she cannot stay on track and always runs over her alloted time and keeps students after. Second she reads off of her slides which makes paying attention or taking notes completely useless. Third she is not ready for teaching she has changed my grade in the past three days 4 times and blames it on the system.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This particular class I would not take one day a week, it just too much information to cram it and the class will feel endless. She's slow with posting things on blackboard and getting back to students, but if you make the effort she is willing to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2008<br>Class Name: PSYCH241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very knowledgeable and helpful professor. Shes very young and is very interested in what she teaches. No tests, just homework assignments, the homework takes some time, but it sure beats having to take tests!  Good teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/12/2008<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful and understanding.  She is extremely nice and enthusiastic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: PSY241<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was very nice and tried to be very funny, but sometimes lectures were just very boring. Powerpoints are not intriguing, and she posts them so the motivation to pay attention just isn't there. Knows her stuff, but night class never really gets out early...sometimes held after!</div></div></div></body></html>
