Ugh i can't take it! your paper has to be EXACTLY EXACTLY EXACTLY What he wants it to be!! Impossible! Everyone in the class got ether a D or and F on their first memo! it doesnt look up after that. He's also got an attitude problem.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chapin is the easiest Professor. He just expects a lot. The assignments are easy and he is a little anal but he is always ready to help. If you didnt do well in this class you probably missed an assignment. It's a 5 week course and you have 6 assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is really helpful with making your writing better. I liked this class a lot and if you are taking it, try and get Mr. Chapin.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't even think about taking him. He'll screw up your quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The way too much pain in the butt for a 5 week class. Try to avoid him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the worst English professor I had so far. If you have to make your paper brief, he'll say: &quot;unclear&quot;. If you do explain things it is gonna be &quot;wordy&quot;. Pays the way too much attention on minor things and expects students to be perfect. Being honest, he is helpful on resumes and cover letters.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got a B in this class, but for a 2 credit class it should have been much easier and less work. When grading, he is very anal and picky about small details which have little effect in a real business setting. If you give him a rough draft before, he gives little advice or help to improve a grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher that will help you write a good resume. He is a ok grader. I ended up with a B. I would take him again because he is knowledgeable. However, he talks like he is from San Francisco:)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2004<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
