He reads straight from the powerpoints. There is a quiz every other week on four chapters. You have to study to pass them. The midterm was easier than the quizzes because he gives you a study guide. One essay then a group project-grades kind of tough and a final. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2015<br>Class Name: MKT379<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Paul Kessenich is nothing if not a poor leader. He has unfair expectations (i.e. reading his mind for the correct answer), does not explain objectives for assignments well, and does not accept constructive feedback. I challenge anyone (without the answers) to do the simulations and get an acceptable grade. Challenging my grade with the dean.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2015<br>Class Name: MKT379<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Has a special ability to put students to sleep.  Bring your laptop and do homework cause you will learn nothing from the lectures you can't get from a 10 minute glance at the power points.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Just take him and get it over with. He is boring and reads straight from powerpoint slides, and he is unorganized in his materialplanninggrading, but I met some babes in his class and he curved our tests and I got an A. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>This class is a breeze. 4 quizzes Paper midterm and group project. Most understanding professor at depaul when it comes to schedule conflicts. Your an idiot if you don't take this class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>This wasn't a bad class. Not the most exciting, Mostly from power points. One midterm project, a midterm test and a final group project, which we presented to him only, not the class and some in class quizzes. Not too difficult overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2014<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy, but he is an awful professor. He's very unclear with due dates, his syllabus is a mess (one of his major project's due date wasn't in the schedule but in the policies section), he just reads straight off a powerpoint (that is given by the department aka he doesn't make his own PP). Try to avoid him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2013<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher but very boring lectures straight from a powerpoint. His expectations are clear, with a quiz every other week, midterm, final, individual paper, and group project. He offers extra credit and is a very easy grader. No reason to not earn a good grade in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2011<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy and interesting class. He gives you everything you need to know for the quizzez, midterm and final. He also gives extra credit. There are two written assignments which are very easy. Very easy grader. I would take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>prof kessenich is a great professor. the class was easy, and he's straightforward and gives quizzes and 2 hmwk assignments.  he's sweet and gives extra credit! mostly powerpoint lectures, videos, and some group exercises. easy night class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>4 quizzes, 2 papers, midterm, and final. His PP presentations are very helpful. Wouldn't say hard- just that there is a lot of material to learn. The Professor is helpful and there is an opportunity for extra credit. Can't get by without studying. If have to choose I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think he is a good teacher but there are lots of work that you need to be done.4 quizes,2 paper midterm and a final.I would not take his class again so if you have other options I would recommend taking somebody else.</div></div></div></body></html>
