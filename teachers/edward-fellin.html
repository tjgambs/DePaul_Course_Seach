I really enjoyed taking his class. He is clear, helpful and appreciative of hard work. His multiple choice tests can be tough, but if you read the required chapters you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very straightforward.  He is very clear on the topics and what can be expected on the exams.  He is very slow in responding to emails though.  ACC is a tough subject, you will have to put a lot of time and effort if you want an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>over all a great class, gives handouts for all chapters, go to ALL the classes, he pretty much tells you what is on the exams, just watch out for his multiple choice he likes to try and trick you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I HATE acc and dropped it last quarter but this guy makes it so much easier! he is VERY understanding and breaks it down for you in such an amazing way.

Really cool guy, always talking about wanting to leave class for a cocktail.  Has handouts for every chapter and basically asks you want you want on your quizes/exams.  He treats us like people who dont understant accounting, which is awesome for a 101 class.  Take him!</div></div></div></body></html>
