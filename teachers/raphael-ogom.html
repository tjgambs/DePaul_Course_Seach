He allowed old editions of the textbook to save students a lot of money.  I wish he would provide examples of assignments. Do your reading and have something to contribute in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2014<br>Class Name: 501<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Ogom is  great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: MPS542<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed this class much more than I thought I would.

He loves the socratic method, so make sure you did the reading. Only bad this is he doesn't manage time well. He will send you a power point for class with 40 slides and go through about 10.</div></div></div></body></html>
