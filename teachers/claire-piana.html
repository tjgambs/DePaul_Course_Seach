Don't believe the hype - she's bad news.  Avoid her if you are actually interested in politics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Piana made class so enjoyable.  She is very knowledgeable on the subject and her ACCENT and LAUGH are priceless.  I bought the books for nothing- her lectures were very extensive and better explained than the book material.  Take GREAT notes and you'll do fine on the exams and papers.  I highly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2006<br>Class Name: PSC150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy teacher if you pay attention in class and take notes. She gives tons of extra credit that goes towards the total of your grade. Definitely recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2006<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was disapointed with her after reading all these good reviews on here.  she is a tough grader; on the quizes you have to write exactly what she said in class, word for word or she won't give you all the points. she doesn't understand that most people are taking the class as a requirement, not because they wanna be political scientists! avrg prof</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2006<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG! I didnt know nothing about poly science but I learned crap and did quite well with an A in the class even though I didnt show up for like 50% of the classes. Papers are easy and so are quizzes, I definately suggest you take her, she knows her stuff and is a cool teacer even with her accent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2006<br>Class Name: 5CLASSES<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not only beautiful, but the best teacher in the political science department at depaul. She cares more about you actually learning things than her own hidden agenda like most other PSC professors. shes the &quot;shiznite&quot; take her again and again and again.... if she would be interested... id marry her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2005<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really one of the best at DePaul, end of story</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: PSC250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an excellent teacher with an incredible knowledge of West European Politics and possess a great rapport with he students. Worth taking for any poly sci major and other</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2005<br>Class Name: PSC250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had her for both of her classes now, PSC 245 also, and I have enjoyed both. Light amounts of reading, many assignments to get a balanced grade. she knows her stuff, too, since she worked for the EU for awhile. Accent can be tough (since she's from Belgium), but she knows it and jokes about it all the time. Take her if you can</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG! Claire Piana rocks! She is so funny and can't pernounce her &quot;t's,&quot; so she says them like &quot;f's.&quot; She really was a awsome prof and made the sbject matter so interesting. I would take her again in a heart beat. Anyone interested in polysci should def take a course with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: PSC200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely a teacher to take if your interested in international politics.  Very nice and doesnt make you go to class in order to get a high grade, as long as you finish the assignments.  Funny and very interested in what she is teaching, even though the class could have been 10 times more boring!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: PSC200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dry boring material made interesting by Prof. Piana. If you are thinking about taking a poly sci class, she is the teacher. Fantastic Absolutely Fantastic. Cannot say enough about her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: PSC200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>possibly the most boring class ever... somehow she made it cool and worth going. she has a cool accent and really knows her shiznite. she's really helpful and u dont have to go to class. She's definitely a cutie to boot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2004<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows her stuff about the EU. Watch out for her quizzes because sometimes she has questions that she doesnt even talk about in class often enough. There is a term paper and final exam for this class. Often hard to understand what she means or what is important to learn in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: PSC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a fantastic professor.  Of course, she is incredibly book smart. However, her real-life experience within European Union politics is untouchable.  She is really laid-back and makes every class engaging and interesting.  Ok, Ok...she also happens to be incredibly beautiful!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2004<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i was not very interested in the subject matter coming into this class, and therefore my judgement upon it is very biased. the professor, though, was engaging and clear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2004<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very engaging, smart, and interesting. An excellent knowledge of international political affairs with a European point of view. Her accent, Belgian, makes her hard to understand at times, but otherwise she is fantastic.</div></div></div></body></html>
