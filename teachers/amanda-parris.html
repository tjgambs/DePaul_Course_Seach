    I definitely recommend taking prof Parris. I've taken several classes with her, and I might take another if the opportunity presents itself. She's incredibly knowledgeable. She's helpful and goes out of her way to be available for students. You can't blow off her class, so only take if you actually want to learn the subject.

    I loved this teacher and this class. She lecutures a lot, most of every period, but it's always very interesting if you can follow along. I took the sophomore seminar multiculturalism philosophical approach, it was great. She really sparked my interest in philosophy. She's funny, smart, nice, a great professor overall.

    DON'T TAKE HER. When she lectures, you'd think the class is super easy. Eventually, you'll be stunned on how much expectations she expect out of undergrad students. At the time she returns your assignment, you will end up in having to meet a psychiatrist to recover from the frustration caused by the so vague answers she thinks are (complete). Don't

    She's pretty brilliant. Her lessons are clear and very insightful, though she tends to give some unnecessary info. Midterm/Final questions given ahead of time.HOWEVER,she didn't return anything until the week before finals. Maybe she was having an off semester. Regardless. A bit irresponsible, but likable. Returns emails and loves raisins.

    She's a really nice and intelligent prof who expects your best.  She really wants to see engagement, effort and innovation from her students.  If you read the material, pay attention, ask/answer some questions, she'll appreciate it.  She's very helpful and I've had good experiences in both her classes.  When writing papers, don't BS, she'll know.

    Amanda is a good professor. grade is based on participation,  weekly reading questions, two short papers, midterm and final (questions are given ahead of time) she is very willing to help so i would definitely recommend going to her office hours with questions about exams she is funny and tries her best to make philosophy interesting take her!

    She is an awesome teacher. She is so comfortable to talk to and really enjoys what she teaches. It's a simple class in which all you have to do is pay attention and have good notes. However, she gives the questions a week before the exams and you can ask for it to be explained.

    I really liked Amanda. Shes cool and laid back. The mid term and final are passable as long as you go to class and take notes during her lectures. She gives you the questions that will be on the mid term and final. Her lectures really make the readings a lot easier to understand. The first few days are a bit rough until you get used to her style.

    Amanda really wanted her students to succeed. Her lectures are a bit unorganized, but it's because she is trying to explain things in so many ways so everyone can understand them. No surprises on the midterm or final. Take her if you are willing to put in the work because you will get an A.

    Definitely tries to explain the subject as best as she can but the texts are really complex. Uses the same complicated language the books do which is not helpful at all. Notes incredibly unorganized. No tests, no quizzes...3 short papers but they have to be perfect because she's extremely critical

    She is a good teacher but really expects a lot out of you. Lectures the entire time and tends to get very boring. Reading responses are due each week and you really MUST study for the midterm and final.

    The readings were difficult for me, but when she lectured about them, they were a bit easier to understand. At one point, the whole class was failing her quizzes. When she asked what she was doing wrong, she argued with students and insisted she was right. I've had two horrible teachers at DePaul and she is one of them.

    Ok, so let's just sit back a second and realize that Philosophy 100 is a required introductory class.  Meaning that 90% of the class couldn't care less.  Oh and the reason the school has a bookstore is so that we can get the books on campus not 20 minutes away.  Basically, she wants you to regurgitate what philosophers said, not think for yourself.

    I had her for a substitute in my Early Modern Philosophy class, and I'm so glad I got to experience her as a teacher, if only for that one day. She was incredibly clear and though she went through the material very quickly, I was able to understand everything she said. I definitely plan on taking her for philosophy in the future. Energetic &amp; cute.

    She is really nice.  She is a tough grader, but the class is so interesting that I did not mind getting a B.  Your grade all depends on papers--no exams.  If you have to take a PHL class, try and take her. You will learn a lot and never ever be bored. She has a true passion for Philosophy.

    She defintely gives an ample amount of work! Like every week &amp; 1/2 you have 2 two page journal entries due. Lots and lots, I cant stress it anymore, lots of reading. Her lectures are engaging and she is really nice, but if you dont think you can deal with all the work, dont bother! Quizes every Mon.

    She is terrible! Sure, if you actually pay attention to her every word, you might get a C on the quiz. She grades the journals a little off... like she expects everyone to get a C on them. The only good thing about the class is when she erases the board... her arm moves all funny.

    The thing is she is a good teacher but she gives a ton of work. Reading everday, quiz every week, and 4 pages worth of journal entries every two weeks. If you dont participate in class dont take her. Participation is 25% of the grade.

    Excellent teacher. Thorough grader and can be tough at times, but quite clear on her expectations. Deeply interested in philosophy and will do everything possible to make you understand. Invovles class in lecture/discussions, and homework amounts to four essays (one in class). Highly recommended.

    As a person she is really nice, and if you talk to her after class she is 100% willing to meet with you. The class itself though is really hard, not in the amount of work but the actual work itself.

    She definitely knows philosophy, and is willing to help you understand if you truely want to learn. However I think some of her quizzes are a little too demanding. She is very particular about her papers, so you can suffer dramatically on the first paper

    Very easy teacher.  As a commerce student, I found that she made the class very easy.  A few papers, but she gives you so many choices.  Take notes and talk, and you'll Ace this class.

    She's extremely odd. She tells the class how she dreams of killing people and small dogs. The class is a little too hard for non-philosophy majors. She grades papers hard and it is hard to know exactly what she wants in the papers.

    Requirements weren't so difficult but the for a non-philsophy major assignment were pretty difficult. Grading was on assignments was pretty tough.
