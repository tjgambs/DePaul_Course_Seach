A lot of people seemed to in my class and he got very angry about the low class participation. Tough grader and is a bit abrasive in his feedback in writing and in person.

I ran into some difficulties along the way and he went well out of his way to ensure that I got the job done well. Super knowledgable & experienced with his field - he made this non-major course interesting. Really clear, helpful guy... would recommend taking his course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2013<br>Class Name: CDM120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this professor for my video editing class.
