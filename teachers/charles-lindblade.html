I have no idea how he grades but it is almost impossible to fail a test. If you get a higher grade on your final than your grade in the class he'll give you the higher grade. Hes like 75 years old and is so friendly one of the best teachers, open book open note tests too. makes it so much easier. GREAT GUYsj</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2009<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i LOVE dr. lindblade...almost gave him a hug on the last day of class. the class consists of 3 tests and a final. has a weird way of grading in which he gives u pts even if ur answer is wrong (even tho theres no room to show work) randomly gives oppurtunities for extra credit, shoot for an A avg on ur tests n u might not have to take the final :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best math teacher EVER. EVERYONE IN MY CLASS ADORES HIM! He is kind and helpful, it's not even funny.I felt terrible because he said that the math department did not want him to teach any course higher than WRC 204.they must be on drugs because he is the most clear, considerate math teacher I've ever known and thats saying alot cause im bad at math</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2007<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is sometimes hard to follow when going through problems. He has little quizzes every day that count for a grade, and only 10 out of 14 are graded, which is nice. this class was very easy, but thats probably because I already had calculus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best i ever did in math.  He knows how to teach probably because hes had a lot of practice since hes borderline retirement.  He gives you assignments everynight and quizzes every class so you have to go to class. but if you get 100 on all the quizzes you get exempt from the final.  also, u get to use ur notes calculators and books on EVERYTHING!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome. Knows how to teach, very helpful and nice with a subtle sense of humor. Quiz every class, best 10 out of 14 counts toward an exam, three exams and a final. If you do the homework, which he doesn't collect, and pay attentions in class, its a guarenteed A+.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/13/2006<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME. especially if you're early on in math or not that good at it, he makes it really easy to get an A. very nice, very helpful, doesn't take stuff personally.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love, Love, LOVE Dr. Lindblade.

I feel dumber for taking the class! a monkey would do a better job teaching. makes mistakes on the board alot and then rewrites the problem over and over and over and over and over and over... get the point&#63; that's what class is like! don't be a sucker just because hes an old man!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best math teacher i ever had. explains everything. Lets you use books, calculator and notes on all tests and quizes. If you have a question all you have to do is ask and he will walk you throught it, devotes time to his students and really cares how you do in the class, def will take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best math teacher I've ever had hands down. Allows books, notes, and calculator on tests. Mini Quizzes everyday but you can use your calc. If you have a question on the test he basically walks you through it right there. Awesome guy. Wants to see you succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2005<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>How can you fail this course&#63; Best math teacher out there. Do good on all the mini quizzes and tests and you dont have to take the final. He's funny and great at explaining problems. Notes, books, and calculator allowed on all tests but not quizzes, such a breeze</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2004<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Explains everything.  Old just goes through the motions but is teaching because he loves doing it.  Open notes on quizzes and test make everything a breeze.  It was pretty  much a review course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2004<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher in the school</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2004<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome teacher, take him if you can, easy A wish I could take him for all my classes.  practically impossible to fail.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2004<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very clear in his teaching and is willing to answer all of your questions.  He is accessible and helps you understand everything.  He also lets you use notes on tests and tells you what will be on them beforehand in most cases.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2004<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>lets you use book notes on tests but will not help you if you are struggling</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2003<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him twice and although he is confusing, it is the easiest A ever.  He lets you use notes and a book on the tests and most people didn't have to take the final.  If you do bad on a test he gives you 1 question quizes (open book) to get points.</div></div></div></body></html>
