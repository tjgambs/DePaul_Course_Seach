He gives really engaging lectures that are easy to understand. Quizzes are easy; he'll even give you the option to correct your mistakes for full credit, so there's no reason to not get 100%. Case studies are pretty easy too.

THIS. MAN. He is a fantastic teacher and is always willing to help you out! I had to miss a class when there was a quiz so instead of giving me a 0 he let me write a summary of the topic. He'll go out of his way to answer questions and help you with anything from class material to your resume to finding a job or just figuring out your life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2012<br>Class Name: HSP201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nick is fantastic. He's super passionate about the industry. The homework is absurdly easy and there is no final exam, but you still learn a lot. I've taken HSP 201 and 202 with him and I would highly recommend any class by Dr. Nick. He'll also bring breakfast for his early morning classes!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2012<br>Class Name: HSP201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT professor.

One of my favorite teachers I have had at DePaul. The class is very easy, no exams. You have 4 lectures and the rest are field trips. My class visited the university club and the park hyatt on michigan. Fun class and great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2012<br>Class Name: HSP201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Nick is a great professor. He does take a point off for missing class but the quizzes and case studies are very easy. If I didn't miss a class I would be getting a 100%. He does let you correct any wrong quiz questions. Need to read the assigned book to do book analysis. Book is an easy read but would not suggest procrastinating on reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2012<br>Class Name: HSP202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun class, awesome professor! One day you spend on lecture the other day is spent on a field trip going to different hospitality establishments in the city. No tests, just a few assignments and one small, very easy, paper. Take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2012<br>Class Name: HSP201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor! Easy and interesting class in which you will actually use the information in the real world. No tests, just a few simple assignments. Lectures are interesting and engaging. Professor is considerate of student needs and times and treats us as equals instead of "beneath" him like some professors do. Highly reccommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2011<br>Class Name: HSP201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best professors.
