There are nightly assignments, but you typically get full credit as long as you do them. If you come to class prepared and look like you're trying, she'll work with you. And you get to bring a card with formulas, etc. to the final exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kristin may seem to be daunting initially, but she is really nice and helpful. Nice and helpful does not mean she will be flexible or a pushover...EVER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The curriculum is almost insultingly easy to anyone who has passed Algebra I in high school, but somehow she still manages to phrase the homework questions in ways that are vague and utterly confusing. She fails to grasp incredibly basic mathematical concepts. Do not take her class unless you enjoy constant frustration and confusion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes a hard grader but if you get on her good side she will meet with you to discuss the group project at the end. She also gives out alot of homework and is the only LSP 120 teacher that doesnt let you use a note sheet on the final and midterm. and she thinks shes funny.....shes NOT</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's rude, condescending, and unwilling to help if you're having trouble with the content of this course. It's dry subject matter to begin with, and she brings very little life to the course. Her standards are far too high for a freshman level course, and she let's her English background flood into the class unnecessarily.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are not doing well in the class drop it off before you fail. She will mislead you and tell you that you wonâ??t fail the class but in reality you will.  So donâ??t listen to her! She wants to get good ratings on the teacher evaluation forms so she can teach.  Low quality teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman gives so much homework! She will make your life miserable. Prepare for a nightmare.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Exams are hard, disorganized and confusing. She forgets to explain things. I would not recommend her if you really want to learn anything. Stay away from her. She will make your quoter miserable. Assigns work all the time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2010<br>Class Name: HON180<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the class is easy just do your work and you're good. The only time you will have trouble or get confused is when she tries to explain things and realizes 5 minutes in that she's completely wrong, which unfortunately happens OFTEN.  It's not the class that sucks...  SHE MAKES THE CLASS SUCK so STAY AWAY</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2010<br>Class Name: HON180<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can get an A but only if you suck up to her. She's a TERRIBLE instructor, knows nothing about statistics. You'll find yourself constantly correcting her in class. Don't take this lady.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2010<br>Class Name: HON180<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I cannot believe that anyone would say anything good about this woman!  She is by far the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life, and MEAN!  She has no idea what she is talking about  NEVER TAKE HER, although our class took care of that because after emails to the administration they said she would never teach this class again. STAY AWAY!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For the most part she is a really easy teacher just make sure you hand in your homework on time (at the beginning of class) or you will get no credit at all even if you're just late to class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She comes from a liberal arts perspective (an English major) which makes the class more palatable for those of us without number-minds. The final project is challenging- but she breaks it down into stages to help you out. 5 Homeworks and 13 Activities.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2009<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an awesome teacher. She's very funny and the class is extremely easy. I would recommend her to any of my friends. Attendance was mandatory, but I missed class all the time and still received an A. The midterm and final are a piece of cake and the homework/activities are done in class and extremely easy too. She was very helpful too.</div></div></div></body></html>
