    I'll sum up this class for you: I got the highest scores in the class on both exams (two A's), and I ended up with a B. Not even a B+. We had a group project, and we have no clue what our grade for that was. I studied really hard because I wanted an A, but apparently it doesn't matter. Her grading makes no sense, and good luck trying to talk to her

    Literally the material isn't hard theres a group project, midterm and final  But as a professor, she is pretty terrible. Doesn't have clear directions on anything. Doesn't have a schedule so you rarely know when things are due She expects class participation but every time you say something she acts like she doesn't speak english Take someone else!

    Great class. She knows a lot about the industry, and you will learn a lot. The focus groups and surveys take some time, but it's worth it.

    EXCRUITATINGLY BORING! Professor has no control of her class, and LOVES to hear herself talk. Don' buy the book, because she doesn't teach from it. You can pretty much come and go whenever you want to in this class. Midterm, final, and group presentation that you will have absolutely NO guidance on. Don't ask for a curve.

    If there was another professor in DePaul who would teach this class, it would be best to pick them over Hillman. Powerpoint slides are a bit pointless since they come from the book anyway. Since she curves tests, she wants to make it so that students actually did well even though they didn't.

    She is horrible, top 3 worst I have had at DePaul.  Don't buy book, she doesn't teach from it.  Hell, she didn't even teach out of the book she told us to buy.  Going to class is pointless

    Do not buy the book because the PowerPoints she uses in class don't match the material in the expensive book. Unstructured class. Take a different professor.

    Absolutely no structure in the entire class - not helpful at all.  I got by with a B and that was still hard.  I had true interest in market research and learned nothing in this class.  All excel assignments that are shown on screen in class, not taught how to read them or what they mean. Avoid if you can.

    Definitely not the most interesting class you'll take, but that has a lot to do with the subject matter... class is easy at least, grades are heavily padded. I took summer session class and our midterm and final were half easy multiple choice, half take home plug some numbers into excel &amp; let it run some tests.

    Honestly hated this class.  She is a very sweet lady, but the course is very dry and the project is not incorporated into class discussions.  It feels like she made slides of book chapters which is great for some, but I don't pay 2 grand/quarter to be lectured out of a book, I can read it for a lot cheaper. Class is very lackluster :(

    HORRIBLE! I would rather graduate late then ever take her again for another class. Worst professor at DePaul hands down. I ended up knowing less about statistics then when i came in. do yourself a favor and AVOID AT ALL COSTS!

    One of the nicest professors I have had at DePaul! She has a ton of real-world marketing experience, so her lectures are always interesting and filled with stories.  The exams are not easy, but she is a leniant grader overall. She is in a wheelchair, so she has an assistant who comes to class and helps her out.  Overall great class!

    I missed 15 problems on the midterm and still got an A on it... an 80% is an A- in this class. Study for the tests from her slides, that is where she develops questions from. Class sessions are painful to sit through, but she is so easy at grading. Still work hard though because people still ended up with C's even with that grading scale some how!

    there are weekly hw but are graded for completion there are a midterm and final which include take home and MC. it was kind of hard to understand stuff because she cannot get up and walk to the board and write examples so she has students do it and you dont always get what shes trying to show you. but if you know stats then this class is easy.

    Easy class, but she's a horrible professor. Can't teach and thinks she's funny. But it will help if you suck up a little. Just teach yourself and study the notes, slides, and the book.

    Students that took Hillman for Spring Quarter 06 probably didn't learn anything about Statistical Analysis.  She was only there for 3 sessions.  We still managed to take a midterm after 3 sessions and it was like shooting into the dark.

    Seriously one of the easiest clases I've taken.  Do not buy the book, you dont need it.  Tests off of powerpoints.  Took 4 tests instead of a midterm and final.  One final project in the end.  Easy A if you actually try in the class, and she sees that your interested!

    Dr. Hillman is really good professor. She provides you with all of the material that she wants you to know during her lectures and her H.W. assignments are also very helpful. Just do your assignments and study for the exams &amp; you'll get A. She really tried to be funny, so cut her some slack. You can take a lot out of her class, it's all up to you..

    Professor Hillman is so sweet!  I can't believe all the negative comments!  Some of the material is challenging, but that's why we're here guys...she's always there to help, so stop lying about her not doing so.  She does try to break the ice by cracking some jokes, but overall she's a good professor.  She has a lot of &quot;real world&quot; experience-A++++

    Dr. H is an very sweet woman. She is incredibly experienced in market research and is very happy to share this with her students. Her approach is sometimes vague, but if you study the books and master the concepts she teaches, you'll really learn a lot. I really had to earn my A in this class.

    This class is not easy, and maybe that's what students expect, which is why she received bad scores. I got a B- out of this class, but I learned a lot. She has plenty of real world experience and is VERY willing to help those who ask. She does try to make some jokes, but come on, don't be so cruel!!

    I took this class last year.  I really enjoyed taking her class.  She talked from her level of understanding, so it seemed very difficult, but it made me study hard by reading books and other materials.  I learned a lot. I will take her class, I guess!

    She says one thing, but does another. Laughs at her own jokes, and takes time to look at you so you would smile and pretend you were listening. Whatever you do don't take her, she is fake.

    She is a sweet person but a pretty hard grader. She likes to call on people and expects you to give an answer. I go a C or C+ in the class and I put some effort into it.

    She is a sweet kind person but her class seems to be harder than I thought. I received a C+ in her class thinking I would get a B+. The class is required and seems to be somewhat educational. However, she grades pretty tough. It was ok except dissappointed with the grade. oh well!

    I had her for 202 and 305, she was the only teachers available otherwise I would have taken someone else. She is TERRIBLE! She teaches things in class and then has different stuff on the exams. All and all she is a total **** with a capital B!!!

    This teacher is pretty damn nutty.  Her lectures are unclear, but class is fairly easy if you have taken statistics.  She calls on people randomly, which sucks because it is easy to space out in her class.  Midterm and Final are 40% takehome, 60% in class.  Only 4 assignments worth 15% of grade.

    This is the worst teacher that I have had at Depaul.She is late with grades and acts confused at times.I took her this summer,she still has not posted by final grade.When you email her she acts as if you are bothering her.She does relate the subject to the real world and that is all she does good.

    While she is nice and knows her stuff, she is completely disorganized, unclear, and nuts. She never knew due dates of assignments (which means we didn't), and her grading seems somewhat arbitrary. Group project was a pain and she didn't help.

    Nice person...i had difficulty following her lectures though b/c she is simply all over the place. She knows the material but doesn't follow any structure. I don't think the class was very helpful either.

    Hillman is a worthless professor. You won't learn anything in the class, she loses everything, is always late to class, and doesn't ever explain anything good. I would strongly recommend finding another teacher.

    As a non-marketing major who hadn't taken a stats course previously to MKT 202 I thought Hillman was a great teacher. This is the first time I have ever understood math.  She took the time to explain things so students would understand.
