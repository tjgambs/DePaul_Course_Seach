I don't think I've learned one thing in this class because she teaches you NOTHING. This is an 'intermediate' class taught in COMPLETELY SPANISH. Grades the homework and takes off points for reasons that don't even make sense. Lots of group  essay writing which isn't very productive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2015<br>Class Name: SPN252<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>I've taken several classes with her and I will say she is extremely sweet and will try to help you. Her assignments are not very clear and I often have to ask her for clarification. She is difficult to reach via email so wait until class or her office hours. Otherwise, she is a VERY easy grader (compared to other SPN professors I've had).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2014<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved Maria Masud! She is such a sweetheart and is so helpful. Did not feel intimidated to speak in her class at all. She does a lot of group work, which I loved! I would definitely recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2014<br>Class Name: SPN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>PROF MASUD IS A GEM. Completely wonderful. I was very nervous about speaking spanish in front of a class and making mistakes but she created a great environment. She's wonderful. Probably one of my favorite Spanish professors at DePaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: SPN202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>I love Masud! She's so sweet and nice. She sometimes dismisses class early; sometimes there's only 30 minutes of class time. She tries her best to reduce our workload when she can. The movies we had to watch were fun and interesting. You have to only write 2 essays and edit each one of them once for the whole class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She never gets off her chair. Takes attendance and participation points! Participation is 30% of your grade so if you don't like group work, presentations, or being called on DON'T take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: SPN252<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her personality should have no basis when rating this class and her teaching methods. Do not take her if you do not like working in groups because that is all she does. She sits the entire class time and never once gets up, to do examples or to even help us. She wasn't helpful at all, doesn't teach, you have to teach yourself. GRADES HARD!!!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2011<br>Class Name: SPN252<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her! She's an adorable Cuban! Her laugh is the cutest thing I've ever heard and keeps the class interesting.  She does a good job of teaching the class and the expectations are clearly laid out in the syllabus on a per class basis.  Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2011<br>Class Name: SPAN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Masud is approachable and funny. She demands that you work hard, but she will help you. Her grading is fair. She really cares that you understand not just when but also why the rules apply. Participation and effort will be keys to your success in this class. If you are confused, speak up- she'd love to help you out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2010<br>Class Name: SPN325<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had her for a couple spanish classes and I thought they were fine. She encourages participation in class, which only helps your grade. 200 series were just orals. 325 was a lot of busy work, but she's funny and nice. talk to her if you need to. Also has a fiesta on the last day of class =]</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2010<br>Class Name: SPN252<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had her in the past and didn't really care for her, but in business Spanish she has grown on me! Has native speakers as favorites, but so do much Spanish teachers at DePaul. Nice lady and tries to help whenever you ask! Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: SPN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I did not like her, but she grew on me. Encourages a lot of participation. Assigns a couple little things like presentations and group project. No tests, just orals. Very funny and understanding. Laid back. Overall great teacher; I recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is really nice. expects you to participate. we do use the book and the HW is done online. 2 , 300 word compositions 4 tests out of which the lowest grade is dropped. pretty easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED HER-VERY flexable! Will allow late work!!!- likes students to participate. Only thing I didn't like was the course load seemed to change. So stay on top of ur assignments, she is all good.

Don't expect to learn anything, just get a grade. She counts attendance and assignments are just busy work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful and understanding professor. This class will help you begin to solidify all of the verb tenses. Prepare for a lot of work, but doing it is necessary to get a good grade on the midterm and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2006<br>Class Name: SPNCOMMERCIAL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found her really cool..very understanding, her assignments are a bit complicated to understand, but if you talk to her and let her explain it personally, it should be okay. She is really nice. She does not mind if you arrive late or turn in late work. I would take her again!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Here's the thing, I took Spanish for 4 years in high school and 2 quarters at DePaul (straight A's) and I must say that I have never been so confused about verb tenses in my life! She is the nicest woman, very willing to help, just unclear. Doesn't teach grammer very well, then grades as if she does. I feel I didn't learn anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: SPN106201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved her.

At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.'</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: SPN201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is one of the better spanish teachers I have had so far at depaul (granted, i havent really had good ones so far)...even so, she was helpful, friendly, somewhat gave busy work during class but it always had to do with stories/movies that had been assigned so it helped us understand them more...i would recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: I<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was terrible. She is **** and she screwed me out of an A and she knew it too by always claiming to never get my emails. She can't even speak English so how do you learn from a teacher like that&#63;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2005<br>Class Name: SPANISH106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really easy and if you want an easy A take this class.

The homework consisted of busywork; we never accomplished anything in class.  She was friendly, but I would not recommend her as a professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2005<br>Class Name: FOCALPOINT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are interested in studying South America, take this class. She is really nice and lets you re-write papers until you get an A.

It's not hard to get an A, and if you're willing to use Spanish in class then your Spanish will improve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the nicest, most helpful professors I have had in College.

Her final grades are twisted and you never know what you are going to get.  She is nice, but does not agree on anything and talks about nothing for the entire class. I wouldn't recommend her if you want to learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: SPN106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHe is really nice and really willing to help.
