You must do the reading to know what's going on, it helps to have background knowledge. This PSC120 class is a lot harder than the others.  However, Professor Mezey is incredibly qualified on this topic. He did tv talk shows during the government shutdown.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2013<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Would definitely recommend if you are a Poli Sci major. Incredibly knowledgeable and leads class discussion/lectures add a steady pace and with pointedness/clarity. Shame he's retiring soon, so take him ASAP!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst professor in history, rants endlessly about Obama, and liberals in general. Dislikes wealth, unless it's D.Durbin raining money into DePaul for expansion. He tries to argue with you if you disagree with his politics, embarrassing himself along the way. Clearly he thinks instead of teaching, he should indoctrinate. Don't waste your time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really dry, does nothing but lecture, up to you to decide what to write down, midterm and final papers along with exams, these make up your grade.  Unless you dig political science, I might avoid this one, not a bad professor but not a great one either despite his credentials, also alot of reading as you might expect of very boring text.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2009<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Professor Mezey for intro to political science and also took his Congress and the Legislative Process class.  He is a difficult grader, but only gives a midterm, final and a paper.  He is a great teacher and knows what he is talking about. Didn't buy any of the textbooks and just took notes and was fine.LOVED HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2009<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor-head of the political science department so he is going to ask a lot of you but if you 1) show up to class and 2) do the reading, you'll be fine. The other students who gave him poor ratings probably did neither. Very involved with his students and his teachings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2009<br>Class Name: PSC221<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Classes are boring. He'll help if you ask, otherwise you're on your own. You need to do the reading AND go to class to actually learn anything, he gives examples that aren't in the books, and info from the books are in the tests. Just work hard, and you'll get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: PSC277<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>terrible.  former dean, thinks he's the god of congressional politics, does not care about his classes, refuses to make a study guide, you will wonder why you wasted your time and money</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2008<br>Class Name: PSC354<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great instructor!! Lectures are boring but very insightful. I have had Mezey for 4 classes now and have learned a ton!Fairly easy assignments and he's a pretty easy grader. Reading is important part of the class, as well as attendance. If you do not mind somewhat boring, he is definitely worth taking!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2008<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really hard grader, he is not a nice professor to meet with about papers or exams, he makes a huge deal about tiny errors!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2008<br>Class Name: PSC240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most interesting teachers I've ever had at any level of schooling. He articulates exactly what he is trying to say perfectly. He is the perfect teacher to start your Political Science career at DePaul University with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: PSC220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Head of the Poly-Sci department...so he is pretty tough.  His lectures are booring.  Make sure to read all assignments and participate in class discussion.  Tough grader on exams but overall a very fair professor.  Show some effort and you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2007<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely difficult grader on papers and ESPECIALLY on his exams. Places huge emphasis on the tiniest details and all his papers and exams require you to read and understand a large majority of the assigned reading, which there was a LARGE amount of.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy, but a pretty tough grader. He expects that you read all of the assignments outside of class & likes people who participate in class lecture/discussions. His lectures could get boring, but he knows what he's talking about & if you have a lot of interest in poli-sci & are willing to do the work, definitely take a class from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2006<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Touch professor. He gives lots of reading and is a very hard grader. Explains well but lectures tend to get boring.</div></div></div></body></html>
