I can see other people in my class struggling because there is so much group projects. Dana can be quite funny he is very opinionated and will take off points just because he doesn't agree with what you did. He can be closed minded and blunt sometimes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2012<br>Class Name: DC460<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dana is a great teacher that conveys the material in such an interesting and comprehendible way.  Class is so much fun with his sense of humor and teaching style.  Definitely recommend any class he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: FILM275<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am an A student and his class was the only one to ever trip me up. I recommend writing down every sentence he speaks. The final exam is very hard and asks questions that he discusses during hands on exercises but never writes it down in power points etc. Its like every other production class. Three group projects. You could learn this outside.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: DC220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dana Hodgdon is a very opinionated man. He grades according to what he deems to look or sound "good" and is very unfair. For example, he docked points on one of my assignments because he didn't like the song choice. Final Project is bogus and subject to things he finds interesting; your skill in the field has nothing to do with it. Not recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2009<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY GOOD PROF. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CLASS TO ANYONE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2009<br>Class Name: DC220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As said before, you either like him or you don't. Some say he's &quot;cranky&quot;, but really he doesn't spoon-feed things to you. He's dryly sarcastic, and tells things how they are. The workload is not bad at all. You don't have to come to class but you should, because a lot gets covered in one class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2008<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's hit or miss with Dana. You either like him, or you don't. I like him and think he's one of the better teachers at DePaul. He doesn't sugar coat things and isn't afraid to tell people when their projects suck. He's told it to me before, but I respect his honest opinion. Take his classes if you want to learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2008<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great guy! He really loves film and you can tell he's extremely experienced.  His final was hard, but with some easy studying its an automatic A.  The questions are things any film fanatic should know and he literally gives you the answers to the tests, its just a matter of mesmerization.  The films he shows during class are also very interesting!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know about everyone else, but I sensed a tinge of sexism from him.  Not only that, but he is a tough grader.  I still got a good grade in the end, but it was pretty frustrating.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2007<br>Class Name: DC275<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>****. Extremely Offensive. Terrible Class. 25% of the midterm hadn't been tought - which was brought to his attention 1/2 way through taking it because we were all to scared to bring it up. Would not Reccomend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2007<br>Class Name: DC275<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very negative person; not very fair in grading process. Expected too much for a 200 level class. We spent over 70 hours on projects and he was very critical of what we turned in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2007<br>Class Name: DC275<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You better know the definition of the word OPTIMUM, and be sure to understand the word WUFF</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nicest guy in the world and the class is soo much fun.  little bit of work but most are projects which r decently fun</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2007<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice and entertaining guy. Lectures are interesting and can tell a lot of good stories. Film selections are interesting, maybe he could just add some newer material instead of watching all 80s-90s stuff. Tough grader, especially considering that a lot of people taking DC 205 are not DC majors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2007<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>probably one of the worst teachers i've ever had!  has alot of group projects that take alot of time, especially if you commute.  his test are very hard and he is a very hard grader.   did not make class interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: DCPROD<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Know's his stuff. Get him to tell stories. Any haters don't know the man. He keeps it real and actually makes class entertaining. Show up to class and show u care and he'll know it. Consider him one of the godfather's of the DC program. Study good for his tests, he gives do'overs for ppl who really messed up. Very fair and cheap book too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/18/2007<br>Class Name: FILM205<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not one of the better teachers in film.  Did not learn much and he is a sourpuss.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/03/2006<br>Class Name: FOUNDATIONS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teahcer. Really interesting guy. Has a lot of cool stories if you get him talking. He doesn't like windows ... so what&#63; That has nothing to do with his class. He's really funny and makes class fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2006<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stuffy and arrogant. He's a total Mac fanboy who thinks anything to do with Windows is terrible. Has very odd ideas about what constitutes a good film/video. If you aren't a DC major...skip this prof. His exams are largely based on readings done outside of class which are never mentioned during his lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2006<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not to bad of a guy, had him for Foundations, he doesn't teach a great deal of what he expects you to do...but grades fair and a lot of his classes are interesting, even though he doesn't teach the basics a lot of people prbobly need, he does know what he is doing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2006<br>Class Name: DC275<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
