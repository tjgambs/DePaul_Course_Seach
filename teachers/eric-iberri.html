The class is never exciting, everyone just want the time pass away fast, he speaks in the monotone and moves awkwardly. Well, he is a nice person for sure but teaching is SERIOUSLY not his niche. He takes forever to get into the point he wants to tell and never care about the students!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the worse teachers you could ever encounter.

He pretends to make his class funny, but actually he makes it boring. He gives us a lot of homework, very detailed and requires a lot! I learned nothing from hime,just a waste of time!</div></div></div></body></html>
