Learned a lot, did well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2011<br>Class Name: PRAD244<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor, lenient in grading presentations and helpful when you have a question.
