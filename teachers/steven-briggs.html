One of the last few great ones. His style of teaching is beyond understanding. Great methods and will teach you applicable skills that you will have for the rest of your life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: MGT355<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best PROFESSOR EVER! Everyone needs to take this Professor once in their life! Most Professor just teach and expect the students to understand. This Professor makes sure you apply the concept in real life and that you are successful at it! Just dont use electronics in class EVER! HE IS THE BEST!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2013<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Briggs is without a doubt the best instructor I've had while at DePaul. His teaching method is a little unorthodox but I loved it and I'm sure most people would. I've always been a bit apprehensive about negotiations, but his class helped me get over that.Thank you Professor!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2011<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is easily the best professor I have ever had. He abandons the useless traditions of education memorization and replaces that with an environment of fun. In the the new environment, you get out what you put and actual experience replaces 'textbook' learning style. The final part of the negotiation class is an actual mock negotiation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2011<br>Class Name: MGT355<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Engaging class with real world &quot;negotiations&quot; knowledge. I will say he promises a lot in the beginning & then doesn't deliver that much. But he is incredibly inspiring and fun. Attendance is MANDATORY.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Useless class....you hear more stories then the actual class material. If you want an easy A and dont want to learn anything from the class. This professor is your best option.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2011<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Second most enjoyable class I have ever taken where I ended up getting detained by police due to the course work. Beware this is one of those classes you will either love or hate. No form, first class will be spent deciding on if the textbook and other things will be used. Great teacher if you &quot;get&quot; his teaching method.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2011<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst professor in all Depaul. He talks nicely and makes the class seem very easy and interesting..you end up learning nothing except his silly lifetime stories!!and at the end he's not close to be a fair grader!very biased and opinionated! he grades on personal basis with no structure whatsoever! he doesn't like smart students and feels threatened</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had a lot of respect for him until I found out about his massive Ego. He does not like students who are very good on what he does. He sees them as threats. His grading is fishy because there is no structure and he gets away by having no contractual syllabus prepared in the beginning. Beware !!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2010<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best class in the program. I used the skills I learned to increase my salary as soon as class ended. Then I negotiated a new, much higher salary with a new firm. I now negotiate for everything I can. He is a great teacher and the exercises are AWESOME. The class is fun and fairly interesting. We wrote a 2 pg paper on what grade we deserved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2010<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My first class at Depaul, and I am so happy I had Briggs.  He teaches in a way that is more conversational than by-the-book.  Hes highly entertaing, and the work load is very low.  Dont buy the book.  Definetly take the class with him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2009<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mixed reviews on this course.  Content is great.  Grading system leaves a bit to be desired and I don't believe it accurately represents what a student has truly learned.  That being said, do not expect anything lower than a B+.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2009<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is on 5 Saturdays and time flies!  Not a lot of work outside of class and in-class activities are fun and you learn while doing. Definitely take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2009<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor.  His unconventional approach to teaching focusing on experiential learning definitely suits the subject of negotiations well.  Come away from class with a good understanding of the negotiation process and key concepts relevant to everyday interactions as much as formal negotiations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most useless class I took at DePaul so far (and I have only 4 classes left). Extremely boring lectures about nothing - very hard to stay awake. Has no basis for grading. I would not recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is by far the best class that I've taken at DePaul and I'm 1 class away from graduating. It's completely relevant to my everyday life and the prof is extremely engaging. You do a lot of activities to actually try negotiating rather than being lectured.  Loved it! Take it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took Sat class. Got out early everytime. Nice guy, has a lot of interesting stories. Doesnt believe in exams and doesnt go &quot;by the book&quot;. 90% of grade is based on group project/paper that includes peer evals. Would recommend for easy A. Dont buy textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2008<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class. He is extremely interested. I took him on Saturday and had 7 hour classes. Keeps you interested. Time goes by fast. Lots of interesting stories. Large part of grade is a group project, rated by your peers. Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2008<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Briggs is a great professor and a cool guy.  I took a saturday class and it was laid back, never stayed past 2:30pm, one paper, one project.  Easy and enjoyable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2008<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For 5 classes on a Saturday, why not&#63;  Watch your back on that final paper--he's really looking for how you show him the benefit of giving you an A.  I thought the grading of the final project was a little ridiculous.  It wasn't the best class, it wasn't the worst class.  I thought the class lacked some clear strategies to winning negotiations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He makes the class fun but he has no basis for grading and the first class is a total waist of time.  You will get something out of the class but it is surely not worth the $3k.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2007<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took MGT 500 on a Saturday, combined with Professor Briggs, and you have a very laid-back class.  There were no exams, just a group presentation, a group paper, and an individual paper.  It sounds like a lot of work, but it was fun and interesting at the same time.  I recommend any of Briggs' classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2007<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Briggs, has a very unique teaching style.  You learn a ton in this class, based upon this different teaching style. Group project and paper.  No exams.  Very good teacher, by far best teacher I have had at DePaul thus far.  Take him for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2007<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Aging hipster professor, owns a record label on the side and also does arbitration for companies.  Very entertaining and engaging.  This was my first class at DePaul and I hope all the professors are this interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2007<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took his MGT500 class over 5 Saturdays, and so far it's been the best class I've taken at Kellstadt.  The class was fun, entertaining, and you actually learn a lot.  Your grading is based on one group paper and presentation, one individual paper, and class participation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2005<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is probably the happiest person I know.  There are no quizes tests or finals.  Catch - 2 papers, 10-20 pages each.  One group, one individual.  If you follow his very vew directions, however, it would be hard to fail.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2005<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Solid approach to the class content.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: NEGOTIATIONS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is worthwhile for gaining an edge with regard to negotiations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2004<br>Class Name: MGT563<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is interesting but you don't really learn much.
