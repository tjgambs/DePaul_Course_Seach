    This class is dry, but he tries his best to teach it with enthusiasm. The quizzes are either really easy or really hard. He randomly takes attendance or there'll be an attendance quiz for that day. His voice is very soft, so sometimes it's hard to understand him. He has a cool accent though.

    Prof Reinhardt is a kind hearted guy, passionate about the subject, however, he is in no way qualified to teach the course. I skipped class to teach myself the lectures. He is extremely unclear and does not engage with students in class. I caught him off guard when I simply asked a question in class. Myomlab is a waste of money.

    Gil is a great person. His lectures can be dry and boring, however. He passes out powerpoints and that's all you need to study. There are Sunday night assignments that are multiple choice/word problems. Gil allows an 8.5"-11" front-and-back sheet of notes for midterm/final! The class isn't easy, but you always have your course materials with you.

    He is not a hard teacher like everyone says! online hw is very easy. He gives you a study guide for the tests plus the essay questions. He tells you exactly what you need to study and even lets you have a cheat sheet for both tests. Definitely take him! plus he curves the final grade.

    This class is NOT EASY. Professor Reinhardt is a great guy and all BUT his teaching methods are slow and the material is very difficult to understand. I didn't really like this class and felt it was one of the hardest I've had here at DePaul. Midterm and Final are extremely difficult.

    The supply chain class is very heavy on Excel - if you like that type of thing, you should take the class.  Prof Reinhardt is a fair grader and will meet you outside of class to help you through any tricky assignments.  Grit your teeth and get through the math, and you'll be fine.  Overall, he's a nice guy.

    The professor went above and beyond to be helpful. He even met outside his office hours and on a different campus location (his office is in the loop &amp; he met us in LPC). 3 easy online quizzes, 5 group assignments w/1 dropped, &amp; a group project. Didn't open book and no exams! A little boring during lecture, but take him!

    Very difficult. While  you can find ways to ace all the online HW, the midterm and final are very in depth. Lots of statistics and he is not fantastic at presenting. He does respond promptly to e-mail and is clearly passionate about the subject, but unfortunately that won't get you an A. If there are other professors said to be easier, take them.

    Very nice guy, but if you don't like statistics, this class will be challenging for you because there is a lot of forecasting problems requiring basic stats. His exams are SUPER easy because he tells you exactly what to study and what the format will be. Keep clicker Q answers, they show up on tests! Understand ratios, concepts and you will do ok

    Very boring!! He does not know how to clearly explain and demonstrate the material, if you liking teaching material to yourself then go for it.He can be helpful and he seems willing to assist you there's just an immense lack of clarity with what he's teaching and what you are expected to do.

    Don't take this professor!!  He does not use the book and spends the entire class lecturing from pointless powerpoints that are hard to understand.  The midterm and final are crazy. I did not understand the point in learning all this material for an intro management class

    Absolutely under no circumstances should anyone take him for MGT 301, and I'm assuming any other class he teaches. He does not teach, you will need to teach yourself, mid term and final are awful. He is too lazy to grade homework so it's done over the internet where when one part of the answer is wrong by a decimal the entire is answer is incorrect

Needs to get the class more involved b/c him talking in front of the room and droning on and on about nonsense is NOT cutting it.  Just plain terrible!! Best if you like to teach yourself EVERYTHING b/c trust me, you won't learn from h

    This has been the WORST class! The teacher seriously needs to revamp his teaching style.  I'm a great student and never fall asleep in class but this class was my downfall.  The teacher is nice but so boring it'll bring you to tears.  All he does is teach from powerpoint, I looked around my classroom and everyone's faces are blank and uninterested.

    Made Ops Mgt as interesting as it could be.  He is very knowledgeable and is a great teacher.  The class is very organized.  Very helpful outside of class, too.  Likes to have several online sessions, which is both good and bad.  I would highly recommend him for any Ops class.

    Best at using computer integration in class. Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable. Kept class interested even with intense amount of work in 5 week summer. Also great about keeping his word (posting homework, grades on time, etc). Take him if you want to learn, have (some) fun while doing it, and do not want to have an insanely difficult class.

    I took this class in a 5-wk format during the summer and I absolutely LOVED it! Gilles is extremely knowledgeable about operations management. There was a lot of work with two cases due every week, but you work in groups so it's manageable if you plan accordingly (divide and conquer). The midterm and final were open-book, take-home exams.

    I literally slept thru the first 3 weeks of this class. Midterm, final, and online quizzes which you HAVE TO PAY EXTRA for(im sure he's getting a kickback). Prepped us like mad 4 mid, but final was out of left field, not as thorough. You get used to the accent. He's best if you like to teach yourself.

    On replying to the previous comment, yes the course need some excel works, however it is not that hard and the professor clearly explain how to do the work (just for the note, I am a beginner on excel and had no problem at all with all the excel works). The professor also always available during the office hours. Overall, he's a great professor.

    Absolutely horrible teacher.  Whatever is discussed in class is not on the test.  Makes you do so much on EXCEL it is unbelievable.  Don't bother to ask for help because he has no idea what he is doing either.
