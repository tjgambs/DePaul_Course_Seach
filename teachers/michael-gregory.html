I'm a business major and basically just took this class cause I had to. I half assed it and now it brought some my GPA. So take the class seriously or don't take it at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2014<br>Class Name: ANT202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Gregory is SO nice and funny. His lectures are really boring, and I'd definitely say that this class should only meet once during the week and then on Fridays, but even being out in Maywood is fun with him! Maybe no good for a non-major, but majors shouldn't fear taking this class, whether you're into archaeology or not!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2014<br>Class Name: ANT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, this man is a sincere professor who is dedicated to his work and to having his students participate and understand. Very dry course materials and lectures, but he is a good connection for majors and a nice professor to have for an elective.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2013<br>Class Name: HON225<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gregory is such a great guy. His lectures are a bit boring, but he really listened to my class's suggestions to make them better. He really knows what he is talking about and wants you to take away main concepts not little details. His labs are much easier than you first think. I'm not a science person, but I enjoyed this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2013<br>Class Name: ANT202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My only complaint I would ever give about Dr. Gregory is he's a bit crud at answering e-mails. Beyond that though he really knows his stuff and is a really fun, chill guy to be around. He made being out in Maywood in the muck and the heat almost mangeable for people who hate Urban Archaeology/Anthropology.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2009<br>Class Name: ANT102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The course load is easy-- just 4 quizzes and 2 papers & no exams. However, each quiz is only 15 questions and it tests you on specific details from the book. He has no idea how to lecture and he is really unorganized. I do not recommend him whatsoever.. he makes a really interesting subject so hard to understand...</div></div></div></body></html>
