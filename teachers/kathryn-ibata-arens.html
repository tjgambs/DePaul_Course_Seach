She'll scare the hell out of you, and you'll have to do a ridiculous amount of work, but it's worth it.  You'll learn more than you will in any other class.  She's somewhat of a tightwad, but she's extremely fair and absurdly intelligent.

Asian Politics was interesting and the reading was relavant.  The teacher is a bit of a hard nose though. She is very busy with her own reserch and her family and has very little patience or time for students.

One of the best i've had yet.  She seems strict on the first day, but once you get settled in and she gets to know you she is actually very easy.

She definitely keeps you on your toes and you walk away feeling like you really learned something. Avoid her if you are on the lazy side, as she will not be lenient.

She is an exception scholar and, contrary to some of the other entries, a very good teacher.  Her over reliance on class discussions is problematic in that it inhibits the progress of the class.

She will scare off people in the first couple of classes, and even call you out, but if you stick with it, her respect for you be 100fold.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2004<br>Class Name: PSC253<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not as hard as she wants you to think.  Dont worry about the first day or two...she wants to scare the slackers out of class.  I would recomend doing the readings for her class.  She knows what she is talkig about.  Isnt a warm & fuzzy teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2004<br>Class Name: POLISCI<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>dropped after 3 days... one of those teachers who would enjoy failing a student.  rude, abrasive, and cocky.. stay far away</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2003<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes a good teacher and very intelligent, however the class is difficult and requires reading and studying.  I would recommend it to anyone who does not wish to have any easy class. She used to teach at Northwestern, and you can see it. Take her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2003<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>****.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2003<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2003<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terribly demanding and seemingly heartless but warms up by the end of the class.  Scares students to drop the class.  Very smart and very informative.  You gotta do the readings and listen in class otherwise she'll bust your **** (literally).</div></div></div></body></html>
