I took this class for science credit and am so happy. He knows that most people only take his class because it sounds fun, but it really is fun! He is an easy grader (he tries to give points anywhere he can) and there is not so much math involved in the science-y part of cinematography. I would take him again! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: DC275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Marc is one of the best professors I've ever had! He knows so much about cinematography, as he is a practitioner of the craft. He always shares tips that will make your films look professional and anecdotes about his experiences on set. You have to make 2 films and take a final. The class is focused on hands-on activities. Very interesting stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2012<br>Class Name: DC274<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would highly recommend this class to anyone who needs the lab requirement.  There's really not a lot of work involved and the midterm and final were very straightforward.  The lectures tended to be long, but he really tries to make it interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2012<br>Class Name: DC274<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't imagine why anyone would rate Professor Menet any lower than great. I was nervous about taking this class I thought it would be too intense. It turned about to be very easy and very applicable. Menet is extremely helpful and nice and he truly simplifies the subject. The quizes + tests were straightforward. The labs were fairly easy as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2012<br>Class Name: DC274<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Marc's class is amazing. I know absolutely nothing about cinematic motion and he explained everything in an entertaining fashion. This class is great to take as a science lab requirement. The lab is a little tricky but if you ever need assistance, there's always someone there to help. I absolutely recommend this class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2011<br>Class Name: DC274<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Menet is an ok teacher. He isn't the most interesting but knows his stuff. Since he does what he teaches for a living it's interesting to hear his stories. However, lectures are boring, and labs are too easy. The labs don't help you understand the lectures. If you are taking this class to get science credit, don't take it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2011<br>Class Name: DC274<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes not very clear on what is expected from the students, doesnt answer questions clearly and doesnt care to see the class is lost.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2011<br>Class Name: DC274<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took him last quarter, not the best experience. Too much work cramped in a quarter, alot of time outside of class required.
