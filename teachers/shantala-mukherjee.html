The key to doing well on her midterms and finals is to do the practices, she will let you bring one paper of notes for both the midterm and final, put the answers of the practice on this paper and that is all you will need to know. She isn't bad to look at either, hope it is easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2005<br>Class Name: MATH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok these people are crazy Shantala is awesome. Here class is boring but easy. Everything is explained clearly and her tests are like a carbon copy of the review packets. She just changes the numbers. Totally easy I recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The people that gave a smile face are telling you a fib.Anywho, Shantala is HORRIBLE! I recieved a B in her class, but literally i did not learn a thing. She is intelligent, but does not know how to project her intelligence in a way one can understand. Do not take her, i swear you will be miserable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2005<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extremely unclear expectations, wastes endless time writing meaningless phrases on the board, very incompetant grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2005<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dont know what these guys are talking about,I had her and I thought she was soo great.

Her knowledge of the material is beyond good. She knows what she is talking about and can always answer any questions you may have. Her midterms and final were hard as hell, but the curve she gave our class helped everyone out! So, if everyone does bad, you'll end up wit</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2004<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate her.

She makes me hate math and Im good @ it. Its an easy class if ur responsible of teaching urself but I don't recommend her 2 anyone.
