Rather than mindless memorization, he shows just a few works per theoretical concept. You will remember what you learned and will be able to apply it to works that you have never even seen. You will never be bored in class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2014<br>Class Name: HAA282<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The good- Lectures are intellectual, curriculum flows well, student engagement, and even the project was fun.  The bad- MEMORIZATION- Dates, locations, building, picture.... It becomes incredibly hard to remember every architect every date and every name and location of every building and be able to identify them by their picture. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/22/2014<br>Class Name: HAA242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sami is definitely the best professor I've had at DePaul.  He's able to break down incredibly complicated connections between art and what's going on in the world in ways that make it both understandable and interesting.  Lectures are always engaging and he really listens to students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2013<br>Class Name: HAA242<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>average teacher. knows what he's talking about an keeps students engaged for the most part, but lots of reading and he's a tough grader. favors art majors.</div></div></div></body></html>
