Judah didn't help at all, and when contacted him for help, he made it seem like I was dumb and he just didn't care who I was.  For an easy class that is still tough take him. but i wouldnt waste my time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2006<br>Class Name: HUMANSEXUALITY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was interesting at times but it was all power point. we would sit there while he talked from a power point which was incredibly boring. I sometimes dreaded going to class because it was so boring. Overall it was really easy, u never get hw and the midterm and final are easy if u know ur stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: PSYCH215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is not difficult at all.
