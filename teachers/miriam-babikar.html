Arb seq. because she's passionate about the subject she teaches. She makes sure everyone in the class participates in order to ensure that nobody is left behind. I'm sad that these classes have come to an end because she is amazing- the best Arabic professor at DePaul. If you want to learn, take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2007<br>Class Name: ARB102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor.  Grammar in Arabic is hard, BUT with Babiker as your teacher, ARB 102 was very manageable.  Although there is a lot of homework assigned and 2 weekly journal entries, if you want to learn how to write proper Arabic, it's very useful.  The midterm and final were challenging, but still completely doable.  Babiker rocks!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: ARA101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is the best teacher ever, she is very nice and sweet. she helped me learn how to read and write Arabic</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: ARB101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i found the class to be hard but pretty interesting. The only problem is the language barrier. She's good at telling you the names of objects, but not so good at more abstract concepts, I think. But I found it to be pretty interesting and I'm taking 102 next time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2006<br>Class Name: ARB101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.  I would've never in a million years have guessed that I'd be given the knowledge to write and read Arabic.  Because of Prof. Babikar, I possess this ability and am extremely grateful.  Such an incredibly nice woman.  Due to the language barrier, though, many had a hard time communicating with her & disliked her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2006<br>Class Name: ARB101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a bit confusing because her English is not fantastic.  A lot of people didn't like her, and it was generally those who didn't put in the work that felt this way.  Arabic is a tough language, and she does a good job explaining it.  If you read the book and work hard, you'll do fine.  She's especially helpful if you go in during office hours.</div></div></div></body></html>
