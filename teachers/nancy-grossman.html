If you want to learn something, be challenged, and be treated like a thinking adult, look elsewhere.  She's a nice person, but she seems to care more about the honors government club she runs than academics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2010<br>Class Name: HON351<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>it's clear that she really cares about what she's doing, but it's also clear that she treats students like children who need to be spoonfed.  she must have an empty nest syndrome because she talks about her own kids *all the time* and so maybe feels a need to &quot;mother&quot; everyone.  equally clear: she very obviously picks non-academic favorites.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2010<br>Class Name: HON351<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>How does one accurately describe someone who has been an advisor who has successfully helped me in revolutionary was with finding out what the hell to do with my life, who has had an answer for every question I've had while at DePaul, and who has been an excellent professor whose class seems to be run flawlessly&#63;  Ahh, yes.  Nancy Grossman.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2009<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It took the creative writing class, overall good experience. Writing on the spot in class can be annoying or difficult, but generally an easy class, little reading, mostly involves writing and reading poems and short stories. Sometimes Nancy reads to the class for fifteen minutes in the beginning, its a nice chill atmosphere but semi sophomoric.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2009<br>Class Name: HON500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dis be where it at</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2009<br>Class Name: ADVISOR<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nancy is a wonderful advisor and will help you accomplish whatever you set your mind to!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2009<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was very nice and helpful.  The class was sometimes aggravating when she would make you take quiet time and write, because a lot of people can't write during class time.  I feel that sometimes she picks favorites, but is never mean.  I got all A's on her papers but a B+ in the class because I was asked to be quiet once..&#63;Overrall good</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2007<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Passionate about teaching.  Pretty easy entry level class.  Probably should just finish her novel though...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You can tell she loves teaching a baseball class, but she was so into it, she didn't try to get the students very interested. Her papers took a long time to research & write, and she pretty much gave anyone an A who spent more than 15 minutes on it. I like her better as an advisor, but if you want to just talk sports with a teacher, she's the one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2006<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think most people liked her, but I really didnt.  Most things we did in-class were pretty pointless.  We constantly had to write things for papers off the top of our heads without having done any research.  She picks favorites, but isn't mean to anyone.  I could tell she cares about students, but she taught us like we were in 3rd grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nancy knows her stuff about baseball but the class was kind of boring. shes understanding and always willing to help with honors advising. shes knows a lot shes just kind of a boring teacher, a great person though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2006<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a bit pretentious and for no real reason; she has a bacholors from U of I and a masters from Columbia College (the lame art school). I personally cant stand her and the arrogant aura that she at time projects, BUT most kids in the Hon Program generally like her...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: HON110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!!!

I was dreading taking a four hour class on baseball, but she's done just a great job. Her methods are fun, and she just has such a good approach to teaching. She really is as great as everyone says. And her papers are never boring... always something fun. Take her.. she's the best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: HON101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher.
