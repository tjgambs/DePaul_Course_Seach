She gives clear criteria for grading and structure of the assignments. She also uploads examples of the assignments. Reading was not too heavy, around 30 pages split between 2 readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2015<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Traci uses her own experiences to teach the class and it makes it so much easier. Weekly argument paper is super easy after a while. She's really open and makes everyone feel comfortable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2015<br>Class Name: SOC310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Traci is a very interesting person. She is super intimidating at first, but you will quickly warm up to her. She offers an amazingly unique perspective and her class will really challenge you to think. Papers every week based on readings, but as long as you try, you will get an A. She's funny, witty, and cute, and you will definitely learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>She's incredibly tough - first time teaching undergrads at DePaul and didn't seem to know how to lower her expectations. But she is passionate about what she does, and each class meeting is full of surprises. If you're not willing to work for a grade, don't take her class. Papers every week after dense reading. No textbooks and no tests!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: 101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Take this class! Dr. Traci is one of the best professor I have had. She has had a very interesting life and uses that to teach. She opened my eyes up to many social problems. You write a three page paper every week but it gets much easier as each week passes. Take this class if you want your eyes to be opened to the world around you! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2014<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>This class is so disorganized. Avoid!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2014<br>Class Name: WHITERACISM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Traci is awesome. She knows her stuff from personal experience and academia. She opened my eyes to a pool of knowledge I never new existed regarding race relations and discrimination. She is raw and tells it to you straight, no censors. Prepare to do some readings and writings every week, but in the end it will make your a stronger student.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/07/2013<br>Class Name: SOC414<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor should be declared a saint.  Gives 1000 percent of her time to you and will provide you all the help you need.  She makes you work and earn your grade but you'll be happy to. Can't say enough good things about her.  She is the bomb.com.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/17/2011<br>Class Name: SOC310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. S was AMAZING. There is a weekly response on the assigned readings which makes up a good chunk of your grade. 1 final paper, 1 outline, and opp. for extra credit (no midterms). It may seem like a lot of work, but she makes the class so interesting you don't mind the work. Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2011<br>Class Name: SOC310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>there was a lot of reading, but if you did the work you could get a good grade.  no exams or quizzes.  plus, she's really fun and passionate which makes classes more interesting.  a bunch of guest speakers and films, too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2009<br>Class Name: SOC248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is my second class with this professor, and I love her! I have NEVER learned as much. Yes there are weekly responses, but they aren't difficult. She holds your hand for the entire final paper, there is no reason not to do well. She is really interesting, knows her stuff, and is passionate about it. TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: SOC214<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>1st thing about Tracy, she is NOT EASY. VERY HARD. 3 page paper every week, and a final paper too. A LOT of reading. she thinks that her class is the only one you got. she is interesting tho, i'll give her that, but VERY, VERY HARD. hard grader, and is probably the hardest professor at depaul. u WILL learn from her, but overwhelming amount of work</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2009<br>Class Name: HON301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned more in this course than any other I have taken.  She's really passionate and knowledgeable about legal theory, which makes coming to class more fun.  It was a lot of work though, so be prepared.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: SOC310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a good professor and really knows her stuff. she is passionate about what she teaches.  There are weekly papers and a good amount of readings in this class, she's not easy.  Her beliefs are really far to the left, so if that's any sort of problem for you, don't take her! She states her political opinions A LOT! Not a bad class or prof overall</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2007<br>Class Name: SOC248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is hard but worth it! Lot of reading and writing but interesting & helpful. She grades fairly & cares about the class & material. no tests, there is 1 long paper that she gives time to help with in class. personable, honest, fair: take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2007<br>Class Name: SOC400<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall a pretty good class.  The readings were excellent but I think she is rather biased in her presentation of the material.  A little reflexive sociology on her part may help her teaching style.  However, like I said, overall a good course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2007<br>Class Name: SOC248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There's a lot of reading and writing, but the readings are really interesting and discussions make the class go quickly.  Plus, you can raise you're grade a bunch with extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2007<br>Class Name: SOCLAW<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're the type that does your work and shows up, she's definitely easy and very easy on grading. She doesn't believe in tests so there are papers. she gives you the guidelines and grades accordingly. very easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2007<br>Class Name: SOCSECT<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i had t-schles quarters ago. good amount of reading and participation. for that, i just talked with her about the readings in her office, for like 5-10 mins. its not bad. i also submitted work that i'm sure she disagreed with, but i still got an A. she's open-minded, and a fair grader. +, she easy on the eyes (boo if she still got colored hair tho)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2007<br>Class Name: SOC310<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS THE HARDEST PROFESSOR EVER!!! a lot and lot of reading daily, and a 3 page paper every week. on top of that a midterm and final paper. very strict on participation. shes one of those professors that puts a checkmark next to yor name every time you speak in class, and if you dont, then too bad. she does know a lot, but VERY HARD.

SHE IS DEFINATELY NOT EASY! I'm a senior and she is the hardest teacher I've taken in Depaul. She requires hundreds of pages of reading a week. I'M NOT EXAGGERATING! She requires a paper every week. She tell you clearly that she is a very hard grader. BEWARE! STAY AWAY FROM HER CLASSES!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2007<br>Class Name: SOC447<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>strict on grading, class discussions were boring (she like to give too many examples from her personal life)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2007<br>Class Name: SOC447<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good choice of reading materials, does well leading discussions.
