Her class was a breath of fresh air and I enjoyed attending every class. You'll have a good time and learn something as well, which are two things that are not easy to find.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: GER103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so helpful and available for tutoring. Her tutoring is crystal clear and brief. She makes german very very comprehendible, which is a gift. Really funny and laid back, lets you out early, and so sweet and charming. If you start german,take her. She wants you to get an A and will honestly help you more than any other teacher I know to get one</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2009<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is high school all over again. If you do the papers and turn everything in you can get an A. Very boring, but she is very reasonable. She is also very nice and tries to be funny. I got lazy so I earned a B+, but like I said just do the work and you will get an A+</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: GER102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>despite the fact that we have covered in two quarters what i covered in 3 years in high school, the class is easy. she tells you exactly what to study and what will be on the tests. during the test when you ask her questions she will literally tell you which is right and which is wrong. not much homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/02/2007<br>Class Name: GER101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is sooo sweet and easy-going.  She tells you everything you need to know for the quizzes/tests and doesn't really require you to come to class, but you can't blame her if you don't understand anything because she's always available to tutor. Her laugh is adorable & she's actually not stern/serious like an average German! Recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: GER103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really made me lose all passion for this subject. I feel like I could learn more just reading the text at home - making this class a waste of time. I'm pretty sure that my knowledge of German decreases with each class. HOWEVER, it is as easy A, if that's what you're looking for.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2007<br>Class Name: GER106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.
