Final Grade A+</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2013<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Sullivan has a great mastery of the content, however he does not always instruct in the most effective way and can be unclear at times. The exams were difficult if you didn't prepare well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/04/2013<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very nice professor but has a mono-tone which makes the class alot more challenging since the material is very dry. He also is very confusing to follow and changes his mind about the correct answers. He assigns about 30 homework problems which really don't help much when it comes down to the midterm or final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2013<br>Class Name: ACC383<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So hard, once you're behind you can't make up for it. He assigns at least 30 problems a week to do which takes hours and hours. He is a good professor but this is also a very dense subject. Only way to study is to do problems and apply the tax code.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/06/2012<br>Class Name: ACC558<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very polite and professional... but the problem is he doesn't teach you and you have absolutely no clue what you are expected to learn from this class, and know, and naturally retain... I was disappointed as other than the court cases I didn't learn anything, and the paper is a total waste of time... I would retake this with someone else</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2011<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A good professor will show you the interest in Accounting. A bad professor will try to confuse you no matter how hard you study. Mark is the second one. He has no mercy and methods to teach. Exams are extremely tricky and hard. Some of his students did fail his classes. Very terrible. Think it over seriously before you register for his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2011<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take any classes from this professor.  Very poor lectures.  He mumbles and seems confused most of the class, and none of the in class material is relevant to exams.  Doesn't cover the important material in the textbook.  The midterm and final are multiple choice from a test bank, but tricky, and he could barely answer them himself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2011<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think his good, especially for those who know nothing about accounting before. He's not an interesting teacher, but he has a great patient. If you have any questions, he will expain them to you step by step untill you understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT558<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Sullivan was too proud of himself. In fact, not only his mumble class was so boring, but also his exams were tricky. Even though we spent long time in studying, the result was very poor. If DePaul would provide refund, we would ask for that right the way since his lectures did not really worth a penny. The worst professor ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with the comments below. Very poor teaching style. He stands and lectures on complex problems when he should be working them out on the board. He has the wrong teaching method for this sort of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2011<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible lecturer. Getting an A in the class heading into final but only because I had to spend A LOT of time outside of class studying. Learned nothing from his lectures. He's probably the worst professor I have had at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2011<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He blazes through mountains of material, but then tests you on completely different topics. He admits that 90% of the exam is random questions from a test bank, and they DO NOT parallel what was taught in class. No midterm review, either, and for a class that covers such a large volume of tax rules, students could really use some guidance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sullivan was pretty good. Having never taken an accounting class before, I found it fairly difficult, but his lectures are clear (although reviewing the slides afterwards while studying is not, so make sure to take notes), and he says exactly what is covered on the tests. Midterms and Final are straightforward, not too hard, and they're curved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2010<br>Class Name: ACCT500<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Midterm and Final are multiple choice with one written section and the only grades but it is curved so not bad. Sullivan is a little goofy, but not a bad class just boring</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2009<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Sullivan is a great professor.  I disagree with many of the comments on here.  He takes the time to ensure people understand, and has a very good flow and organization to how the materials are presented.  Do the homework problems, they are very similar to the exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/27/2008<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Agreed with other comments.  I was at his office a few times and he doesn't really have a good method of delivering his knowledge of accounting to you. His syllabus said he was very old school and wanted to teach the class as if we were going to be accountants; other profs are better and keep the material geared toward MBAs. Agree he is uninspiring</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2008<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I could not disagree more with the prior 4 ratings. I found Sullivan to be quite clear and caring that students understand the material. Grade based on 2 exams is standard at DePaul. The exams were fair and covered the material from the lectures and textbook. He also brings in relevant examples from current events. Not perfect, but a good prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2008<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was very monotonous, not interesting or engaging.  He just reads off of powerpoint slides.  Only 2 multiple choice exams make up the grade, which aren't very useful for actual accounting work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: ACT500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, I got an A in this class, but feel I didn't learn much because of the way it was taught.  I only got an A because of the huge curve he gives for the mid term and final, which are the only 2 grades.  Without it, I would probably have had a low C.  Sullivan as a teacher isn't very engaging; there are better professors at DePaul for the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2008<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't seem to care if students understand; stands at the board and works out his own problems saying, &quot;This is so easy!&quot;  I hope so for you...you're the Prof. you fool.  Don't take him...there are much better accounting professors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2008<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Sullivan seems to be counting down the days to retirement.  He shows very little interest in seeing if you are learning and when you ask questions, still doesn't explain very well.  Teaches as if he is preaching to a choir that already understands and is on the same page with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2008<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>-</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2008<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Recommended.  He was pretty dull, but that was because the class is about Accounting.  He explained the material clearly and thoroughly.  Take him if you just want to learn the material.  (tests are fair)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2007<br>Class Name: ACC551<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material is very complex(taxation) and so much is covered in this class that it is hard to go in depth in teaching or in studying.  What made the calss most difficult was the range of students taking it.  There were 4or5 CPAs, a lawyer, and people who had worked in tax for 10+ years mixed in with fulltime students. Not easy but I leared a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2007<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>boring and uninspiring</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: ACC500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Sullivan is a nice enough guy, but he seems a bit disorganized. He assigns weekly homework that he never collects nor discusses. Grade depends solely on midterm and final, which are multiple-choice and somewhat ambiguous.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: ACCT101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a pretty good teacher.  Accounting is not the easiest subject to learn, but he makes the best of it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Made 101 feel like a 400 level course. Took forever to answer a question and doesn't know how to explain it to non acc majors. Got an A in Calculus but these stuff was like learning Japanese. A very easy course became very difficult. midterm and final only that the majority of the class did poorly on.  seek the acc tutors or another teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2005<br>Class Name: IB500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was all lecture, the only book was a course packet of cases (cases not tested).  He does a good job of explaining the materials, and will explain concepts until everyone understands.  He keeps class interesting, but watch out: the exams can be a bit tricky!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>sullivan's a good guy and he trys to help the students out a lot. the material isn't exacly much to work with and he bases it all off of slides.  good class. good teacher. dont take it as a night class. you'll die.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Beware of the tests!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sullivan seems like a really decent guy, although his teaching method is right off powerpoint, going to class is meaningless and wont help your grade nor will you learn anything more than you would sitting at home reading the powerpoint - the class isnt hard, but its not easy either...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I taught myself the listen. He is confused half the time. He is a horrible teacher.

I only went to one or two classes and I got an A. However I did spend a lot of time studying and teaching myself. Everything he uses in class is posted online.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't recommend him if you want to understand accounting. He teaches strictly by powerpoint.

One spreadsheet assignment (complete 1040/tax return). He uses slides. Allowed us to bring code book on the exam day. He uses understandable examples. However, the exam is a little bit tricky and moves on very quickly.</div></div></div></body></html>
