Gave us lots of freedom on what we wanted to design.

Very laid back and knew what he was talking about!  This class was for NON MAJORS, so it did not go in depth about creating actual animation, however we did learn lots about different types of animations throughout the years.  No midterm, no final exam, no projects.  YOU WILL ENJOY HIS CLASS, I PROMISE.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2014<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I've had so far!

It was an intro class that was taught like the way an intro class is supposed to be, without much pressure. He didn't have any homework, no final, no midterm, no quizzes etc. All you need to get a good grade is answer some questions on a questioner that he gives you at the end f the course. Great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2013<br>Class Name: ANIMATION101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher ever!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
