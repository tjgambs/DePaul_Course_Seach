Great teacher to take over the summer, because he gives a lot of time to go over assignments and lets you out early. The material is confusing and can be difficult, but he tries to make it easier on students. Part of the midterm is open bookopen note. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2015<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very good and nice teacher. He generally only lectured for 34 of the class and would let you leave early or work on HW and ask him for the rest of it. The final was more difficult than the mid-term. Mid-term was 2 parts, a tax return and multiple choice. He lets you use your notes for tax return. Tax is a confusing subject though. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2015<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing lecturer, and he is a fair grader. Offered 5 points extra credit. No surprises on the exams. Would love to take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/15/2014<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Took his summer class. I was worried about taking an accelerated tax accounting class, but it wasn't bad. Online "quizzes" that he allows you to attempt 10 times. Midterm was two-fold, part tax return and part multiple choice. The final was multiple choice and a few short answer. Overall, he was good. You could do much worse.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2013<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems to be all over the place sometimes. Gets thrown off when students ask questions and has many typos/errors. Over all he isnt that bad, his final/midterm is just like the review questions and quizzes he give us. Study those and you'll be fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2013<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ming is a good professor. Study the power points he provides, the class problems, and take home quizzes and you will do fine. Like anything, you must practice and know the material. The midterm and final will not be a surprise if you simply just pay attention. He has a slight accent, but understandable. I recommend him to all accounting students</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such a nice person and a great professor. His test are straight forward right from his power points. His accent is not bad at all. Very clear and straightforward!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2012<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice prof, but is very hard to understand and listen to. Class gets boring, quickly, and his tests are pretty hard. Study the PowerPoints and the quizzes and in-class homework. Overall, nice teacher, but very hard to understand. Would recmd to take someone else just because in tax, speech clarity does help out a lot with the terms and whatnot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't believe he has negative comments, if you dont get an A, something is wrong. He tells you EXACTLY what will be on the test, the midterm and final have no suprises, his accent is not too strong, and he has the regular lame teacher jokes. I would love to take another class with him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2011<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated this class. He is hard to understand and the material is difficult. The midterm is insane and most struggle - several dropped afterward. He gives you a fair amount of the final questions to compensate. There are easy cases to boost your grade a bit. Overall, friendly guy, awful professor. Especially with a topic like tax, stay away!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2011<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you dont have to take this class, dont. This guys midterm is awful, its similar to the in class stuff but he makes small changes that alter everything. However the final is basically given to you, probably to make up for the midterm. He gets annoyed when you dont understand concepts. Overall, nice guy but bad prof. Stay away</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful with all his hand outs and in class excercises. Told us exactly what was on the final and even gave out some answers. Tax is not hard with this guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When we did the midterm, he made it so damn tricky. The midterm had similar questions to quiz/class exercises, but he would make tiny changes to every answer choice and the question so you sit there questioning yourself. I studied EVERYTHIGN, and I went to take test with every concept memorized and those little changes made me blank out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: ACC380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Read my following 2-3 reviews. I will give him average of 3/5 so the reviews don't mess his rating up. This guy might be the easiest tax professor, but if you are an accounting major (obviously if you are taking this class), then do not take him. He gets whiny when kids in class ask him too many questions. And always goes &quot;do I have to explain that</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/23/2010<br>Class Name: ACC308<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>no group project, he prints out the PPP in class for us & overall good pro but he seems to get fustrated in class sometimes when students challege him.
