Beware of taking his advice when working on company simulation....when my group did, we did poorly, but when we just went with our own plan, we ended up winning.

Class is based on a reality-based game (dont matter if u lose). Grade is based on hmwk (responses to articles) only!! Easiest A earned, for a useless class.
