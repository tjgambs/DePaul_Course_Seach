She didn't show up for class multiple times and didn't tell us she wasn't going to show up before hand. When I had something wrong in my MLA format she didn't tell me what was wrong, just told me that it was wrong. Going to class was pointless, you would not miss anything not going. Got an A though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think as required classes go, if you have the opportunity to take it with Prof. Younge you will be OK. She doesn't require you to attend class and assignments are well explained and not too difficult. It would be very difficult for you to not get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the most amazing teachers here at DePaul. She gave extra credit that involved going to a movie and brought snacks and sweets on the last day of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't properly explain assignments. Shows up to class late and still marks people tardy. Cares nothing for her students and picks favorites the first day of class. You cannot recieve an A regardless of writing quality if she doesn't decide she likes you.  If you can get on her good side and write terribly you should do fine in this class...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really funny, laid back teacher who is really good at what she does.  She challenges you a lot with assignments that really test you as a writer but in the end you develop strong writing skills. There's a lot of class discussions and she counts attendance as extra credit towards your final grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes the class so fun and interesting while actually teaching and being helpful. Fair grader but helps you improve to get a higher grade. Great class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Younge was really awesome.  Despite the fact class was not mandatoy, I looked forward to it every day.  She is really interesting, honest, and hilarous.  I highly recommend her English 103 class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Younge is a very nice teacher. She makes English 103 a fun course. Her workload isn't very tough, yet I look forward to each class. From what I can gather, it's very hard to get a nice, easygoing English 103 teacher. She is one of the nice ones. Also, her comments on essays are very useful when you have to go back to revise them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>extra credit at end of term</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2004<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny lady, she is very amusing but she is not lenient at all.

I got really into my paper so I had fun and learned a lot. If you don't like her class its because you aren't making any effort, not her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the most laid-back, cool, fun, and easy going professor I've ever had. I always chatted with her after class and she always gave helpful tips for writing. Although she is very laid-back, she definitely challenges your way of thinking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: 102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you are a complete idiot, she will probably teach you something.  she was wonderfully nice, and quite straight forward. a waste of a few thousand dollars.  if you are really stupid and want to get an a you should take her class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's such a nice person, but the stuff we talked about in class was mostly dry and boring. I sometimes stayed after class to just chat and I never do that, so she's a very likable, friendly woman.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2004<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes cool. she sumtimes is moody buh shes a gud teacher. very easy. if she asks for a journal do a web page she'll luv it! i managed to get my B bumped to an A! yay!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2004<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher by far!
