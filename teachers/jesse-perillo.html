    Dr. Perillo really wants to see students be successful in his course. His lectures are informative and never boring. He engages the class in discussion however participation for the most part is optional and if you are too shy to speak in class you can earn your participation grade by posting in online discussion boards or sending him emails.

    Class requires effort but don't let that scare you away! He is honestly one of the genuinely nicest people I have ever met and clearly cares about his students. 3 6page essays midterm final and few quizzes, lots of readings, but what really matters is the participation. The class is almost entirely lecture and is so interesting and he's amazing!

    He shows no bias in his lectures, which is great. I found the subject dreadfully boring and his voice wasn't helpful. 3 6pg papers, 3 pop quizzes, &amp; he tells you what's on the midtermfinal. Do the reading so you don't get left behind and you'll do fine!

    Jesse is the sweetest person I have ever met. His course work is a little muchlots of reading, 3 quizzes (easy), 3 "short papers" they aren't short they are 6 pages, a midterm, and final. He is very understanding if you're having trouble or are going through something. I wish I could take more of his classes. There is no one like him.

    Prof. Perillo is a really kind professor who genuinely cares for all of his students. He wants you to love the course just as much as he does. There is A LOT of reading, but if you read then all of the papers and quizzes will be a breeze. Lectures are long and the subject matter gets old after a while, but Perillo is a great guy!

    Dr. Perillo is by far the best professor I have had at DePaul. He is so respectful, really cares about his students and wants to help them to the best of his ability. The material is very interesting and he does a great job of explaining all the readings through his lectures. Take this class! You won't regret it!

    Very nice guy. Be prepared for a LOT of reading. Do the readings and take notes in class to prepare for exams. Participate every once in a while and you will get full credit. Very easy grader on papers and exams. If you need an extension, just ask and you will probably get it. Again, there is a lot of reading.

    'm one of those people who never understood philosophy, but Prof. Perillo made it so interesting and understandable. I learned so much from him. He's the sweetest professor I ever had. He's so nice and funny :) I never got tired of listening to him. If you do bad in his class, it's your own fault. He tries to help everyone. Take him! :)

    Jesse is truly one of the nicest professors I've had at DePaul. He is good at explaining the material, and is understanding when it comes to deadlines and his students' other work. There are 3 five-page papers, a midterm, and a final. He makes the subject very interesting/relevant as well.

    Amazing teacher!! He is so nice and very helpful if you ask for help. There is 4 papers that are 4 pages long on your choice of readings. Mid-term is easy and he gives you a good review, and the final is a essay which he gives you the questions before hand. You actually learn a lot   from him. Easy class!

    Jesse is a great professor and overall a genuine man. He is a very simple grader and is very flexible when it comes to grades. There were 4 4page papers a couple quizzes a midterm and a final but if you pay attention in class its an easy A. I didn't even do half of the readings and still did fairly well. Participate but no lying

    Great professor! Everything is covered in class, so no need to read the source material. Discussions are thought-provoking and in-depth. He makes sure everyone understands. He also doesn't mind being interrupted with questions, and understands his job is to teach, not to lecture. Wasn't really looking forward to the class, but I ended up liking it!

    TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! One of the nicest, most understanding professors who is very easy to talk to and passionate about the subject. As long as you show you read the text and make an effort to analyze a little bit then you will get an A for sure.

    He is one of the most helpful teachers i have had. He understands that we are bombarded with work so he would give you a few more days to work on papers if you have a legitimate excuse. The only thing that he expects from you is to have original work, he has zero tolerance for plagiarism.

    If you do the readings and pay attention to the lectures, it is pretty easy to get at least a B+ in the class. He only takes attendance the first two weeks and is very helpful if you have any questions. Also, he allows you an extra day or two on papers if you have a legitimate excuse.
