    She's an expert in the field, and she's not afraid to show it. A lot of reading  - too much to actually get done in conjunction with other classes. Lectures were really informative and I learned more from this class than almost any other I've taken in my 4 years at DePaul.

    SOOOOOOOOO much reading. I am a third year poli sci student who has had a fair share of poli sci class and nothing compares to this one: 150 pages of reading a night. Luckily, no term papers, just two short reflective papers on the reading. She is nice and clear She'll show clips. She's a very tough grader. Exams are short answer and essay.
