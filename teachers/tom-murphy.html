Nice guy, but wouldn't take again. Lectures were unorganized, seemingly pointless.Study guide with all mideterm and final questions... too bad he didnt cover any of the material in class. Paper and group project. Easy A though.Constanty rubs belly</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: ENV202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was boring and the work was very time consuming. We had HW everyday, a midterm, a 2500 word paper, a group project, a final, and required attendace. The professor was very unclear, all of his notes were based on graphs. You have to do your own research for his exams. This introductory course was simply too demanding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2005<br>Class Name: ORGANICCHEM<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was hard but fair.  He allowed us to try to repair our grades by applying ourselves more.  He was always willing to work with a student.  I loved Murph.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2004<br>Class Name: OCHEM3<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The man is just too smart to be teaching. He forgets that other people might not have picked up everything from previous quarters. Expect to spend most of your study time studying for this subject. Not very clear in lectures, he's quiet, but very funny.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2004<br>Class Name: CHE175<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Murph likes eggs, I like Tofu. Clearly there are some conflicts in our tastes however;the man knows the chemistry of both eggs and tofu. Why is this relevent&#63; The answer is simply because the man allows you choices.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2004<br>Class Name: CHE173<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Finally a prof. who has college level expectations! Doesn't succumb to people who kiss up to him, doesn't play favorites, either you know the material and you do well or you don't know the material and you don't do well. Also enjoyed his dry humor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2003<br>Class Name: ORGANIC3<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is my opinion he likes to make Organic 3 more difficult than it has to be. He's arrogant, and seems to think he can pick up your notebook and read it at anytime in lab. He treated the class like freshman in HS.</div></div></div></body></html>
