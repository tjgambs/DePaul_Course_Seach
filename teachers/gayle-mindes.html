Dr. Gayle Mindes was the most consistently kind, knowledgeable and helpful faculty member I had the pleasure of learning from.  I could come to her with any question: she had unlimited resources in research to share.  She shared her expert faculty contacts in various areas of education to assist me</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2013<br>Class Name: TL422<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Mindes is not clear in her expectations at all. Most of the time you don't know what is going on & she offers NO clarification. She also doesn't take criticism well. If you don't like the way her class is structured, too bad. She thinks it's great. I can't believe she is teaching about being clear when assessing students when she is not clear</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2009<br>Class Name: TL419<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice but out of touch with the class. you will not learn anything, instead be forced to participate in useless discussions on random things that interest her only. this class is easy, only because she gives everyone the exact same grade. but def expect to be totally confused about her assignments and super irritated with the course over al</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2008<br>Class Name: TL422<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her class assignments are not well explained. When asking for clarification, you walk away feeling even more confused.  She is an easy grader, but you feel disconnected.  She assigns tons of reading and asks if you &quot;have any questions&quot;at the beginning of class. But does not spend time discussing what we just read. She's out of touch w/students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2008<br>Class Name: TL419<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an awesome teacher. Requires alot, but you walk away feeling like you've learned alot. Very easy going and accomodating.</div></div></div></body></html>
