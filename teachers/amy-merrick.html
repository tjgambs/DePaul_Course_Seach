She has a lot of life experiences in news that she shares. She catered the class to what we wanted to learn. When we wanted to make an online portfolio she brought in someone to show us how. She is also willing to meet with students to advice them on stories. The only book we used was AP Style.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Forster was great. He has a great personality and a good attitude. Class is almost fun with him. You will definitely have to work hard though and attend class. If you don't read the book you probably won't pass the class since his lectures don't cover everything. But the tests are open note.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2014<br>Class Name: JOUR278<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amy was the best professor I've had in college. She is so passionate about journalism, and she makes you remember why you want to report as a career. She is very clear on what she expects of you, and she assigns projects that really make you put yourself out there. I recommend her everyone, even non majors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2014<br>Class Name: JOUR279<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amy is honestly one of the best professors at DePaul. I took her intro class my freshman year and this feature writing class last spring. Sweet as pie, professional, super helpful and flexible with ideas. She will work with you on stories and gives great advice and feedback on assignments. All of her students love her. 10/10 would recommend!</div></div></div></body></html>
