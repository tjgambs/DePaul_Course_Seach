He was interesting, comprehensive, friendly, and fair. This was a religion class, but he touched on politics, philosophy, and science. The 3 "big" assignments and a few other small things were pretty painless. Regardless of what you want to take his class for, you'll get a lot out of it.</div></div></div></body></html>
