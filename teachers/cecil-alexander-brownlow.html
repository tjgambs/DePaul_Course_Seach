READ. Reading is super super important for his classes. Why? He wants you to know so much more out there than just his opinion. CRITICAL THINKING. He doesn't want you to just sit there and do the basics to get by. He wants his students to excel. PARTICIPATE. This is mainly for the students. BUT also for him! He wants new ideas</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2014<br>Class Name: GEO200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is absolutely terrible.  He'll assign 1,000+ word essays with only 24-48 hours notice before they're due.  He thinks that his class is the only thing going on in students lives and that they ought to drop everything they're doing at the moment to get his assignments done.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: GEO300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is just wonderful.

He makes the class subject he is teaching very interesting and you can tell he loves what he does. We basically had like 3 assignments in the class, the quizzes were a bit difficult though. Other than that I highly recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2013<br>Class Name: GEO200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart guy. The class wasn't what I expected it to be, but it was very fulfilling. It is a fair amount of work, sometimes on very short deadlines, but I always managed to get it done. You will get a lot out of this class, definitely recommend it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2012<br>Class Name: GEO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! In the beginning of the quarter I was a little confused but as he continued to teach everything came together. He is very interesting to listen to. Class consisted of one midterm, two papers, and one hard final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2012<br>Class Name: GEO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am not a big fan of geography but he definitely made this class enjoyable. Wonderful, approachable professor who is really invested in seeing students succeed. Friendly, very fun and is obviously incredibly well versed in the class topic and has a way of explaining it to students. Take a class with him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2011<br>Class Name: GEO260<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are great and he keeps you interested. Very smart man. He's not clear on grading and there is a lot of reading involved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2011<br>Class Name: GEO205<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher DePaul has!!!

The class is borderline impossible. 2-3 70 page readings per night, a 12 page 25 source research paper final, blue book tests that will give you carpal tunnel. Just don't do it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: GEO205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The amount of readings he assigned per class was not manageable if you are a full time student. I tried to read everything but it was like reading a novel per class. I am willing to work hard for my grade but this was a little ridiculous. He is a nice guy but needs to better manage his workload because it felt like a hard 300 level class not 200.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: GEO210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Well, I will start of with the negatives. His class is HARD, he expects a lot out of his students. He also kind of acts cocky which got on my nerves a little. BUT, I learned so much in his class. I took a class with him over a year ago and I remember everything he taught. I got more out of that class than probably any other class I've had at Depaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2009<br>Class Name: GEO200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned more in the 2 classes I took with him than I did in all my other classes put together. He is the epitomy of a college level class experience. Take him or you'll seriously miss out!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2009<br>Class Name: GEOGEO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far, the BEST professor at DePaul. I don't understand how anyone couldn't like him! He's one of the most intelligent people I've ever met, but presents his material so that anyone can undertand it. He's passionate and funny, and he cares about his students. Show him respect and he'll return it. DON'T MISS THE CHANCE TO TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2009<br>Class Name: GEO260<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow. I learned so much from his Global Resources class: looked forward to it every time. But boy, was it HARD! Probably the hardest, but most rewarding, interesting class I've taken yet. Alec's amazing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: GEO120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Brownlow is an awesome professor. Very laid-back, fair grader, explains everything... Take him if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2008<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for explore. Loved immersion week with him class time was a bit boring. Don't buy the books just get them from the library (saves you at least $100). Write a lot for everything and final project is a huge paper and presentation so do well on that don't procrastinate. Nice guy overall but can snap at you especially if you talk while he is.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2008<br>Class Name: GEO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not only is he incrediably interested in the subject but he is incrediably knowledgable. He doesn't expect you to know everything only to ask questions and think for yourself. He isn't a typical geo teacher much closer to an international politics perspective. Classes are full of debate and there is no need for a book. He's Inspiring. TAKE HIM</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2008<br>Class Name: GEO120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY enthusiastic.

Don't buy the book because you hardly every use it as a matter of fact we didn't use it at all. For the most part show up to class, take REALLY good notes, and study and you should be fine. The exams are challenging so be ready. Otherwise good pro</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2007<br>Class Name: GEO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Prof at DePaul! He knows his stuff, and he is really helpful. One of the few classes that I have hung on to every word the professor has said. Take him, you will not regret it. He is funny at times too, really cool.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2007<br>Class Name: GEO120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such a nice guy.  The quizez are anoying and hard but at the end he does not count them so much, just make sure you participate and attend all his classes and you will do good, easy B.  He is very helpful and he will make sure that you have fun in that class.  For all the girls out there, he is cute.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2007<br>Class Name: GEO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome...makes you want to learn...one of the few classes that I have taken everything I have learned with me...and I know it is because of the way he presented the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2007<br>Class Name: GEO120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall I think he was a good teacher. I think he presented a lot of interesting concepts that were only strangled by the lack of time we had for the course. I do however wish he would be more clear on exams and stay on topic more. Other than that great guy, and if you do the work and READ you will defintely pass the class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2007<br>Class Name: GEOG210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher. Best there is at DePaul. He makes the subject matter very interesting. I recommend taking one of his courses. Albeit he is not the easiest, but as long as you do the work and show up to class you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2007<br>Class Name: GEO101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher and a really nice guy. He rarely takes attendance, but i would strongly recommend going to class anyway.  I don't really think you need the book, but it helps.  Just make sure you take good notes, and study and you will do well. The midterm was easy. I definitely would recommend him to everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2006<br>Class Name: GEO210<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2006<br>Class Name: GEO210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i love this professor! he is not that bad.. study hard and you'll ace the class! hes so funny.. and he teaches very clearly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2006<br>Class Name: GEO210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is somewhat interesting though this class is too short to truly understand the concepts presented to you, especially economic terms.

You can tell he has children because he is so great at explaining things in ways that normal people can understand.  All I did was go to class and pay attention, hardly any homework, and I got As on everything.  I really didn't think it was that hard.  He is very smart and puts physical issues in a social context.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: GEO101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is sooooo hot but his tests are really hard.

It was such a struggle but ended up with an A... He's cute.

Not only is he a bad teacher he's rude to his students. I don't see how an upstanding Catholic school like DePaul allows one of their teachers to drop the f bomb daily and tell one of their students to kiss his a**. He gave me a C-.

Cons: Doesn't speak clearly & doesn't stay on topic, doesn't teach what's in the book but doesn't tell you that until after you waste $50 on it, the midterm/final are EXTREMELY difficult, class avg. was a D. AVOID AT ALL COSTS as an elective!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2005<br>Class Name: GEO<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class as an elective..big mistake.  The class itself isn't bad. Half the time he dismisses class an hour early.  No homework but your entire grade is based on an incredibly hard midterm and final.

He specifically emphasizes this point in the classroom. Also, he rambles on and on without knowing what he is saying. Don't buy the book. You will waste money.
