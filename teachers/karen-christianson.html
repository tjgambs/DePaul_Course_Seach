She gives you online quizzes and they are straight from the book. No midterm or final; you write two papers. One is a book report and another is based off of a museum exhibit. She is very clear about what she wants and helps students to be successful in her class. She is so sweet! TAKE HER!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2010<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS AMAZING... loved her wish she taught every class at depaul cause i would take her every time. Super nice, engaging, and knew what the H#LL she was talking about. For a non HST major found myself chatting with her every class about history and life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2009<br>Class Name: HST171<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great prof. usually got out half hour early for night class, very easy grader, interesting class, would definitely take her again, strongly recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2009<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a bad teacher.  Lectures every class, generally got out early.  Blackboard quizzes.  I would probably take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2006<br>Class Name: HIST211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lecture each class, take own notes cuz it will help for the final (dont just copy the powerpoint). Blackboard quizzes: open book, 45 minutes, 30 mc. No midterm, just a critical book analysis based on your interpretation, just have support.Long final, DO THE STUDY GUIDE! She is genuinely nice and very understanding, don't be scared to talk to her :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2006<br>Class Name: HIS211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best. She is so passionate about her studies that although you may hate history, she will make you love it too. Weekly openbook/opennote blackboard quizes (drops lowest grade), open note final, one EASY book analysis. and, if you email her about anything, she gets back to you asap.AND DONT MISS CLASS.ATTENDENCE MANDATORY!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/20/2005<br>Class Name: MEDIEVALHIST<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXTREMELY BORING!! And very rude, I called her to ask her a question and she hung up on me! BY FAR THE WORST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD!!!! STAY AWAY!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: HST210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE HER! She wants her students to succeed and she is an easy grader. She's so nice and has a sense of humor. She also is understanding and helpful. Class breakdown: short homework once a week on the reading, 5 minute presentation, midterm, fun paper, final exam. She gives a VERY detailed study guide for exams and allows open notes. SO EASY!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2005<br>Class Name: HST210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perfect teacher- class isn't hard at all but it is still interesting.  She is really the nicest lady in the world and really understanding.  Definitely take this class for an easy A.  I didn't go to class all the time and I still got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: HISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nicest woman on earth. She laughs at her own jokes and she has a real passion for teaching. Easy class and you'll actually like the readings.  Soooo understanding and for sure you'll get an A. Two thumbs up for her! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: HST210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A total sweetheart, and she loved teaching the topic, every minute of it.  Assignments and papers are at a high school level, don't expect much of a challenge.  Her lectures are taken from notes almost word-for-word, which drove me nuts.  But you're not going to find a teacher who cares more.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: HISTORY210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I thought I would have to drop this class because it was so boring. I'm glad I didn't because this was the easiest &quot;A&quot; at DePaul so far. Very easy assignments, can be completed the night before for an &quot;A.&quot; Final is a take home ESSAY. :). Would recommend or take another clas with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2004<br>Class Name: HST210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice teacher. The paper are easy, however, do not procrastinate on the final. If you decided to do it the same day, don't...its very long. If you like history & medieval history take this class. Its quite interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2004<br>Class Name: HST210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a nice teacher and the class was easy.  However, you needed to attend class and she is a very boring speaker.  Also the grade only consisted of 2 papers, a take-home final, and then participation.  So you didnt have to go to class, but you did.</div></div></div></body></html>
