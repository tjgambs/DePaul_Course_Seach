She loved the topic, and it showed. She's a little silly, but most of the class is just lecture. She allows revisions on papers which is awesome. My only complaint is that she required a citation format for her papers that I didn't quite understand, and it caused me a lot of stress.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2014<br>Class Name: LSP<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG, horrible! her class is a joke so she tries to make it harder than it needs to be. Grades paper stupidly! I'm a health science major so i know how to write and i'm not stupid, but she makes makes nooo sense in how she grades. Annoying! Avoid!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely one of the worst professors I've had at DePaul. Her final exam was so difficult it was ridiculous, and she is super passive aggressive and rude at times. She gives random grades for papers and clearly does not know how a standard paper is written. Do not take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2011<br>Class Name: CTH228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class, one time homework was just walking around and thinking. I learned a lot. Dr Scott can be slightly passive aggressive with her comments but I would advise taking them with a grain of salt. The exams were fair especially if you do the reading and pay attention to the lectures. I'd recommend this class for religion or history credit</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2011<br>Class Name: HST261<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice. Please do not listen to the bad reviews, she lets you rewrite everything and is more than helpful when giving you advice. She can be a little disorganized, but that is the ONLY bad thing I would say about her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2010<br>Class Name: HST261<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a nice lady don't listen to the bad reviews. There is no reason to get a bad grade she lets you rewrite everything! Actually talk to her and she is very helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2009<br>Class Name: CTH228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I do not understand how every one is giving her frown faces... Dr. Scott is an amazing person and teacher, if you are struggling with the subject, she is more than happy to help you.  She is one of the most helpful professors at DePaul!  Her classes are not for slackers. If you like learning to be a bit of a challenge, take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2009<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Uber boring, lame reading material and very tedious and repeatitive. Class consists of her talking a majority of the time for no reason.(I know why she likes to hear herself talk) Take this class only if you are willing to live only for this class!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2009<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst Class ever! She expects this class to be our life!! She's a tough grader and you don't know what she wants until she hands things back.  Unclear with paper assignments. Read five books, wrote 6 1-2 page essays, one 3-5 page essay, the final was four essays, had to go to an extracurricular event unrelated and had to go to a play! NOT COOL</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the worst class I have taken! No joke! Dr. Scott will never make herself absolutely clear about what she wants, and you won't figure it out until you get your paper back--that is if she doesn't lose it!  Very disorganized!  I was very frustrated with the lack of organization and clarity with assignments.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2008<br>Class Name: REL213<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hour and a half class. We were only given an hour for the midterm that included 50 30 Multiple choice, three SHORT ESSAYS (one page each) and 2 LONG essays (3 pages each). Good joke teach. Had to drop because this was not my only class and definitly not my major. One of the worst classes I have taken at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2007<br>Class Name: HST318<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Why does this prof have a straight face&#63;  Dr. Scott isn't the easiest grader in the world, and she does expect you to make good contributions to the discussion, but she's very smart, very knowledgeable and VERY nice.  Her grading on individual papers is tough, but she gives you a 10% grade cushion and allows you to rewrite anything.  Awesome prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: HIST435<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HARD, that is the first thing you need to know.  She will challenge you.  She is demanding.  However, she will always help a student who is trying, but struggling.  If you are in trouble in one of her courses, get in touch with her.  If you crash and burn in her course, it is ultimately your own fault.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: CTH103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Scott is very helpfull!!! lots of reading and writing papers also weekly quizes and small final exam. Also there is extra credit opportunity which replaces lowest 20%...so thats a good thing.  Take her if you like History of Christianity also there is small group presentation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2006<br>Class Name: REL213<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Scott is very nice, but very sneaky because she tricked every single one of us into thinking her class was going to be about christianity in the middle ages.  It wasn't!!! It is freaking bible study hands down.  She is pretty open about everyone's opinions, and is very nice.  No real complaints about her class except that we barely touched on t</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2006<br>Class Name: HST317<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice woman but she doesn't give a good indication of how much work she expects. This class is a full time class so take it with all blow-offs if you want to do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2006<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Waste of a class would never take her repeditive and boring.

She is so nice and helpful. She loves it when students come to talk to her. There is a lot of reading involved and the two quizzes and two papers which are not essay.
