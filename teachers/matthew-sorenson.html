    very knowledgable and charismatic. lectures are entertaining. SOME students express having a hard time following himhis scattered slides. but thats because they want the information in an easy way. I learned by sorting through the material so it made sense to me, because we ACTUALLY HAVE TO KNOW it to be a nurse.

    Use the book and the study guide work book to study for his exams. He uses the questions in the work book for the test and quizzes. He's a goofy guy and knows his meds. Memorizing all those drugs is hard so STUDY!

    Dr. Sorenson is truly one of the best professors in Depaul. He wants every students to pass and do well in his class. He is not the type that tends make things difficult for the students. Because of his teaching style, my interest in  Pharmacology is at it highest level. I ended his class with an A. Great job Dr. Sorenson!!

    Explains material in lab very well. Seems to high level of expectation but demonstrates and explains things in a clear manner.

    Has a sense of humor and is realistic about the profession. Refers to the book often, even from his powerpoints. Test questions can be hard, although they make sense when he reviews them.

    Explains well, clearly knows the material.  Uses stupid jokes, but in a class on research it helps.
