She seems more concerned with students adhering to rubrics than actually thinking critically. With that said, this was the easiest A I've ever earned, so if that's what you're looking for, by all means, take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: PRAD337<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take her class.  If you like PR, she will make you hate it. On our group project, she made us work on online obituary nonprofit (boring and hard to do), and invited speakers who talked about pipes and metal.  She is a very hard grader. Nobody got A from group project except winners. Exams are hard too.  She made me want to quit PR.</div></div></div></body></html>
