I was lucky enough to have her twice during my graduate program, and she is the reason I stayed in the program. She is brilliant and beautiful inside and out, and I will forever remember her and what she taught and instilled in me as an educator.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2010<br>Class Name: LIT120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2009<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a very interesting and useful class.

She currently teaches in the middle level grades, so she brings a lot of insight to the class. She works with Association House for this class, so you are paired up with a student in grades 3-7 for the quarter. There's a lot of week-to-week work, but it is worth it! All DePaul classes should be like this!</div></div></div></body></html>
