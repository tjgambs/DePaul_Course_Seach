I'm not an econ major but I did find both of the classes to be enjoyable.  The homework requires a lot of effort, but it does a lot to reinforce the material, which makes the midterm and final pretty easy. She is very polite, fair, and a good professor. She enjoys econ a lot and goes into a lot of detail.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2010<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>ECO 106: Horrible teacher uses powerpoints from the book, don't bother buying the book because you don't use it. homework requires lots of effort even though its only 12% of your grade. midterm 40% final 40% and online quizzes 8% don't take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2010<br>Class Name: ECO105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay AWAY!

She isn't very good a teaching the first half of the class and rushes through it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice Professor but unfortunately, every bit as disorganized. Lecture notes often have mathematical errors. Does not communicate clearly at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Klier is a good professor. Alot of the reviews here make it out to be that she sucks, but what sucks is GSB 420 in general no matter who you take with it! midterm, final, hw (as long as you get 60% or better you get full credit) and group project (which isnt that bad).  just show up to class, do the hw, and pay attention to the powerpoints.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's the type of professor that understands the material so much that she's unable to clearly teach it to her students.  Her notes were littered with mistakes, as was the book.  She was very unhelpful outside of class.  My final grade was incorrect because she forgot to add several of my homework grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away. She is absolutely horrible. Seems to be new to teaching since she's so disorganized. The midterm and final were extremely hard. The homework multiple choice options are purposely tricky, similar to GMAT answer choices. She is a hard-a99 that asks for feedback, but then doesn't change anything once you share your concerns. AVOID HER.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was difficult, even though it should not have been.  Textbook is horrible.  Professor Klier tried very hard, but it was her 1st quarter at DePaul.  There were a lot of mistakes and at times felt as if we were learning together.  Project was long, but not difficult.  Good way of learning subject matter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hear that GSB420 is horrible no matter who you take.  She tried to teach but it just didn't work.  The book is garbage which didn't help the situation.  It doesn't explain the material that well and when it does it makes it too complicated.  If you can I would recommend testing out of this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was so much work...there was a project I spent about 40+ hours on that was due at the end of the quarter.  The midterm and final weren't that bad but she threw in outrageous multiple choice in the final were all of the answers could of been correct.  It is true if you aren't good at stats/calc that you shouldn't take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She tried but sh'e just not a good teacher. She was confusing and used notes not from the text. The text was crap. The home asked questions based on footnotes. Footnotes are for additional info, if you are asking questions on it them it's not additional but necessary info. My advice try to test out of the class or take another teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2008<br>Class Name: GSB420<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NOOOOOO!!!! Absolutely not! Unless you are strong in the subject already, I do not reccomend her. Calc/stats aren't my strongest areas and I need a professor that is good at explaining the whys and the processes, she can do the work but not able to clearly convey it to others. Just not a gifted instructor, some people just don't need to teach</div></div></div></body></html>
