She needs to not give kids like 2 days to write papers.  Definitely try to turn in rough drafts because she's a hell of a grader on papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2007<br>Class Name: INT202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>shes awesome just take her, u'll see</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2007<br>Class Name: PSC346<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far my favorite DePaul professor.  I took her classes as electives.  She's interesting, insightful, friendly, a fair grader, and despite all the readings has one of the clearest syllabi I've ever had.  She the best!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: PSC2<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the class is very difficult especially if you do not read anything but still pulled off a b because you need to learn to **** and write down what she wants to hear. don't take her if you don't like to read. she knows alot about the subject but too much work for a 200 level class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2006<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First off she is a very very tough grader. She is probably the second hardest teacher I've run into in my 3+ years here so beware if you want an easy class cause this just ain't one of em. But you will learn a lot, she will make you work hard for you grade and is really quite good. Although her classes are kinda unorganized and seems improved alot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2006<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved Her!!- gives good lectures- and shows good movies. She is great unless you piss her off by doing crappy work. Lots of reading...and if you haven't started, read the NY times or various newspapers, she opens every class with questions on what is going on in the world.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2006<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She seemed alright until like maybe a couple of days before the midterm she said we had to memorize what author said what that really messed me up...she is knowledgeable but also rambles on to other stuff and then she had favorite students but which didnt bother me and the final she gives you 22 questions then rolls a dice to answer like 10hard &#63;'s</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2006<br>Class Name: PSCFOREIGNPOL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's awesome! really really smart and doesn't make you feel stupid! she's really unique.  the class is not boring at all! i liked going! she's kind of a hard grader, but gives you so much help prior to when things are due, you deserve to be graded hard. shes not intimidating at all! i lvoed her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>With out a doubt the best professor I've had at DePaul thus far.  Makes the class entertaining and is always willing to help outside of class for literally ANYTHING.  HIghly intelligent but not arrogant.  If you want to be challenged and learn A LOT- take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good teacher, makes class fun and active, enthusiastic about the subject, only thing is shes one hell of a grader in regards to writing. but still worth taking</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2006<br>Class Name: PSC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really great teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2006<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Other then her night class attendance policy, it was a lot of fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2006<br>Class Name: PSC242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!

The topic is up to date. She is so smart and knows so much about the subject. I would take a class with her again.

She assigns a great deal of reading, much of it is redundant. Read the textbook and 3 of the 50 articles she assigns and you'll get an A-. Class discussions are fun until an overzelous student decides go on and on about their own off topic ideas.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>4 quiz's midterm and final..thats it..was alot of reading but able to skim and get important stuff and be ok..in class discussion were AWESOME..i loved going to that class just to join in...for a good grade you must want to praticeaipate and do a lil work..other than that a great teacher..by the way..very nice body...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: PSCUSFOPO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough but very nice.
