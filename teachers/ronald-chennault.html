Genuinely concerned about both his student's and the education world. Significantly enhances DePaul's education program by himself. I would not hesitate to take another class with him. Extremely helpful with his comments on your papers, grades them in under a week. One of the few classes I didn't watch the clock tick down.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2008<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man should be an example for all other professors at DePaul!  He is professional yet human and interested in his students. I had an emergency come up right before class and he was very helpful.  His response time is within hours .  He is the smartest man I have ever met.  Take him and you will be engaged and learn a great deal.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2007<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my first classes at DePaul and a thought provoking one. Chennault is good and makes you think. Does a great job and encourages class discussion. If you need help, he is there and is pretty quick answering emails. I would recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2007<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chennault is a real nice guy, who takes a valued interest in his student's education.

Few people want to take this class and that's not his fault. He made it somewhat bearable. Class did drag on though. The assignments are fair and the reading is more than manageable. He's great at answering questions and splits the material up in a way that is easy to understand. I'd take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Chennault class was very well organized and made the material interesting.
