After a 15 minute PPT a guest speaker comes in everyday to talk about their experience in Human Resources(useless) then everyone goes home. Homework is from ForClass which costs $14 and consists of 9 case studies. She's also a feminist, as she mostly calls on Female students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: MGT307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is very clear about what she expects for each assignment.  There are 6 case studies to read, like 14  5 question online quizzes, 3 online exams  and a group project.  it seems like a lot but it is actually pretty easy stuff.  there are group speakers every other class that have cool stuff to say. overall I have no regrets </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2015<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Gives clear instructions on all her assignments and is always available if you have any questions. All the assignments are completed in groups which makes them easy. The midterm and final does require a bit of studying since you will need to study all the definitions. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/30/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is quite a bit of busy work. Not hard, not super time consuming, but you can get frustrated at the amount of somewhat pointless work you do. The class went by very fast and I enjoyed the discussions. The exams are very nit picky so do not expect an easy A no matter how hard you study for them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Always responds to emails and is there to help. The class is mostly common sense and vocab based. Participation is big in this class. You have to attend class and also participate in it or you will lose points. The questions on her assignments can be really redundant. There is also a group project in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She' great, kind, helpful. If you need to take MGT 300, don't even think about it just take it with her. Plus she's kinda cute(even though she's pregnant). Overall class is easy, she try to keep it interesting. Lot of discussion and participation is needed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2013<br>Class Name: MGT500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor. Very helpful.  You will get a lot out of her class.  Attendance is mandatory as is participation.  Lectures are very discussion based.  A couple of big assignments.  HW every week. No midterm but there is a final exam that consists of cases/scenarios.  Group project and individual project also.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/14/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Jaclyn is really nice, very helpful. great class with her. she is always prepared for class. will help you out if she sees that you are trying your best and putting effort. take her class. you will learn a lot. quiz once a week online. group project, midterm and final. make sure to read the chapters.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You have to go to class, since she gets the class to do lots of grp activities(participation pts), she is very approachable, lectures are interesting since she applies them to real life, bt when it comes to the midterm&final, you have to go over the vocab&read chps!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does a great job keeping the class interesting for a class that is supposed to be all about vocabulary. However, she is a stickler for ending class on time. Took the night class and 8 out of 10 times she ended at 9. Online quizzes easy, but midterm and final difficult if you do not memorize the vocabulary. Read the assigned chapters!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2013<br>Class Name: MGT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Jensen is a hard charging younger professor. Her grading is pre rounded up. She gives some extra credit for extra work completed online. Online quizzes easy but the 2 test (non-cummlative) require an understanding. Big portion of grade is a group presentation. She keeps thing on track very open to meeting and easy to talk to. Highly recommend!!</div></div></div></body></html>
