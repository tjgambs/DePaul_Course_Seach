True, Prof. Larrabee can be a bit spacey, but she's very kind and very intelligent.  The class is discussion-based, fairly low key, and there are some interesting texts!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2010<br>Class Name: PAX250<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very spacey, very soft spoken, no real direction to the class. she had us invision all our troubles in an imaginary box and throw it away in an exercise, as well as play pass with imaginary balls. good class to smoke before i guess</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2010<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Like the other comments said, she's a very nice person but an awful teacher.  She managed to lose half her freshman class on the Green Line the third day most of them were in Chicago.  The students run the discussions, and her directions are horribly vague.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2010<br>Class Name: PHL243<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TOOK IT IN SUMMER @ 9:00 IN THE MORNING(VERY BAD IDEA). BORING, DULL, AND STUPID.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2008<br>Class Name: HON350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was pretty useless.  I feel bad saying that because she's so nice, but she's probably in the wrong field.  Not a fantastic teacher.  And the class subject was disturbingly bad . . . but I had low expectations for a class called the body.  Maybe if the subject was better, she would be more interesting.  I just hated the class so much!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2008<br>Class Name: HON351<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was so terrible.  I hated the subject matter.  She doesn't teach.  She allows students to talk about people magazine for the whole class.  I did not learn anything.  Overall, the readings are aweful, the discussions go nowhere, she doesn't teach at all. I could go on, but she was terrible, let's leave it at that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/24/2007<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes her students run the class, barely ever hear her talk.

She is practically not a teacher... she just sits there and the students just talk.  Pretty weird... I didn't enjoy it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2006<br>Class Name: PHY201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's kind of flaky, but a good teacher.  She's nice and sort of nuts.  She graded essays very fairly and seemed to take student's improvement into account with later essays.  Not a hard class, even though it was a lot of work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2005<br>Class Name: HON111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the nicest prof's i know. She is very accepting and forces you to think about things you witness during the Discover Chicago week. Keep up with the class work and participate in Discussions, you'll be ok.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/26/2005<br>Class Name: PHL250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's okay with me.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very flaky but she is also open minded.  Lets the class flow in her own controlling way.  We had to watch movies that were hard to find but she graded the papers easily as long as you know whats going on youll do fine.  A bit of reading as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2004<br>Class Name: PHL250<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class, but it is a lot of work.

Very easy grader, i didn't read one article and i got A's on all my papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/16/2004<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this class if you want to learn anything! I had her for sophomre seminar, and she was HORRIBLE. Even though she's an easy grader (somewhat), she sucks at class discussions. She allows people to make ignorant comments w/o correcting them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2004<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DONT take this class if your looking for no work. There are daily readings/responces, projects and journal entries. To earn an &quot;A&quot; you must do a lot of work and attend class everday. Her grading is SO confusing. She is nice and helpful though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2004<br>Class Name: ISP100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class isn't hard but there is SOOO much busy and pointless work. There is a paper due pretty much every single class, journal entries, 2 group projects, a midterm, a final, and reading for every class. Grading is confusing too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2003<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was a discover prof a while back; helpful, cool as hell, down to earth, really great woman</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2003<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very organized syllabus- you know exactly what to do and what to expect.
