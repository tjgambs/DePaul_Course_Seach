It was a difficult task,but in the end it got published in a student journal. Learned more one on one about social science than any class at depaul.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2014<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very interested in politics, however the class was not very interesting to me. All lectures, and not much student engagement. He is also a very tough grader! Final and midterm are all essay, along with the two other papers. Not a lot of work but grades hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2014<br>Class Name: PSC263<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not an easy grader, but he's not tough either. Class discussions were kept interesting. His lectures were great too. If you pay attention and take good notes, you can learn a lot in his classes.

Definitely has high expectations for the writing assignments, but his criticism is constructive and detailed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: PSC269<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far one of the best professors I have had at DePaul. He keeps you engaged during class with discussions and he goes over basically everything in the textbook; minimal reading done in this class and I still did very well. I am looking forward to taking more classes with this professors. Weekly journal assignments, midterm, and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: PSC269<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor and a great course.  Does a great job of keeping the class discussion flowing and does not put his opinion above the students.  Can be a hard grader but if you do the reading and come to class ready to talk you will do fine.</div></div></div></body></html>
