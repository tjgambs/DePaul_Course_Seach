    Burnham is the coolestnerdiest teacher I have ever had. He is truly passionate about his course and does his best to make sure his students succeed. Every assignment is clearly  outlined in the syllabus and relates back to the course material. Participation is definitely encouraged. I truly enjoyed going to his class.

    Professor Burnham is nerdy but knowledgeable! The class isn't hard per say but you can't just show up &amp; pass. 5 reading quizzes but if you read at least the summaries of each chapter you'll do well on them. Tests not so bad, semi tough essay grader but nothing you can't handle with a little focus. I like him! Would recommend!
