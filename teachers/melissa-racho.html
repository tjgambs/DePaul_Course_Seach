At least she doesn't grade beyond effort, if you put a decent amount of effort in, even if your projects look like crap, you'll get an A. Not terrible, but not great either...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2010<br>Class Name: ANA101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One word A-W-E-S-O-M-E Mel understands who difficult these programs are and gives a student EVERY opportunity. Loved this class and she is ranked as my fav. teacher and I'm a business student - GREAT CLASS.. you will love her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2010<br>Class Name: ANI105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't know enough about Animation or how to form a complete sentence for that matter. Also seems to lack common sense when it comes to the internet, such as youtube videos. I learned nothing in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2010<br>Class Name: ANI105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mel is pretty cool as long as you do what is told and try at the hw and study for the quizzes you should be fine. She is a little scattered at times but she has a lot of knowledge in animation. She is really cool to talk with outside of class if you get the chance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2010<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mel is the best! I would definitely recommend her. The class is based upon her showing you what to do in class then going to the lab and doing it yourself so attendance is important. She is extremely helpful. I had no prior animation experience and received an A. The final consists of creating your own animation.Just show up to class & apply effort</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2010<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mel is great!! She tends to ramble a little bit, but it's a fairly easy class if you do the work. She's very helpful because After Effects is a touchy software. Also, it's a good idea to bring a flash drive (with a fair amount of memory) to class because you may get lab time to work on your projects</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2010<br>Class Name: ANI105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great instructor quizzes do not make any sense and honestly she does forget items left of hers around the students she works with but she is very helpful and has a ton of input some direct criticism when need be. I would honestly take her classes but remember don't use the study guides  cause they are useless to a point</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2009<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mel is very helpful and lenient. Each class she teaches u something different on Afteraffects and photoshop and you have a small asignment basically so that she knows u were paying attention.SO pay attention, dont talk while she is talking. got an A in the class and had no prior knowledge of the programs. easy A, just pay attention.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2009<br>Class Name: ANI101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is hard if you are DC major then take this class otherwise get ready to work hard for only this class. This class will ruin your quarter. You will have to do assignments outside class that she goes over in class but very fast.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2009<br>Class Name: ARTSEC1<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NOT REALLY INTRESTING CLASS, HARD, TAKE IT IF YOU ARE SMART, N HARD WORKIN PERSON.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/24/2008<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would recommend this class to anyone.  Mel is a great teacher and will spend as much time with you to help you get your things done.  She tells you what you have to do, you get it done, then you leave.  It seem horrible at first but trust me it gets better.  You make a website on whatever you want. Easy A, unless you're a lazy idiot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2008<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Melissa is a great teacher she always goes over everything step by step and makes your life very simple! Would totally recommend her, she makes the class easy and it is a great substitute for any other science quantitative class! Easy in class assignments, and the final is just making a website, the class is an easy A!</div></div></div></body></html>
