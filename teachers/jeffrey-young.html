POV-Ray is a hard program to get used to, but he gave you all the necessary knowledge needed to complete a decent scene.  Very respectful and understanding to students who actually put forth the effort and try hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/17/2007<br>Class Name: GPH212<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy got picked last for every team in gym class.  He's one of those people that just makes you want to quit Computer Science.  Big nerd with a big ego and lets it get in the way of his teaching.  Made me feel horrible for missing one class even though he never did anything interesting.  In week 5 he added a midterm that wasn't on the syllabus.</div></div></div></body></html>
