Even if you don't make the effort to reach out and communicate with any other professor this guy should be where you make an exception.

I recommend for RE majors, but if taking this class as an elective think again... Lectures are long and intense, and the mid-term and final require lots and lots of studying.  Weekly online quizzes. Weekly assignments. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2014<br>Class Name: RE798<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Reflecting on this course much of the material soaked in. However the work was tedious, long paper projects that he put low effort in to grade, and he worked hard to make himself look smart rather than put the students first. Not a good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2014<br>Class Name: RE798<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He will do anything to not produce any materials for class. Instead, he assigns multiple 5 page writing assignments each week on top of a 10-15 page Research Paper that he only discusses with the class once. The one time we did discuss he only provided nonconstructive advice and came off condescending. Many guest lecturers come and are unnecessary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2013<br>Class Name: RE350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really good professor. Anyone that comes to DePaul should take this class because it is very relevant to any student. The material was very interesting and the assignment were actually worth my while. I learned a lot that I plan on using in the real world.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2012<br>Class Name: RE798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best RE prof in the entire program. The man has forgotten more about RE then most of us will ever know. Took him for the Argus class, every week we had an investment memo due. Didn't need the books at all! just make sure you have an understanding of financial analysis before taking class. Very personable guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2010<br>Class Name: RE798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bell is a great teacher. He is funny and down to earth. Real world kind of guy. His classes always involve a lot of writing. Papers due basically every week. Subjective grading. Final exam is always hard with mc, short answer and essays. All that stated, he is one of the best teachers in the entire graduate program. If you work hard, you'll succeed</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2010<br>Class Name: RE350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Average.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2009<br>Class Name: FIN530<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the best class I have ever taken. Bell is a great teacher and really cares about his students. He is always helpful and wants everyone to do great. The class is a Harvard case study class, which amounts to at least 8 hours of HW/week. Only 1 test. Speakers come in on a regular basis and get to go on a field trip. It is a great class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2009<br>Class Name: FIN798<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Urban Planning - Bell is a good guy. This class is a ton of work though. Everyone has to write 10-15 page book report, do group paper and pres, read text, group super-project and pres, take final (MC and Essay) and grad students have another book to read and a report due. Class is just really time consuming.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2009<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Urban planning - interesting class, but he gives way too much work for one undergrad class.  Group research paper & presentation, group urban planning presentation (easy), book review due by finals & then finals based on lecture slides and 40% essay.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2008<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>what do you think about the urban planning fin 398 class&#63; Thanks!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: FIN530<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Highly recommended. This has been my best class and favorite professor at DePaul so far (about halfway through MBA program). The class discussion and cases reinforce the topics very well, and the guest speakers and property tour were fantastic.  The casework is time-consuming outside of class, but not busy work.  We never touched the textbook.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2008<br>Class Name: FIN530<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Real Estate Finance course. He invited 2-3 guest speakers to class. They were all DePaul MBA grads who had gone into Real Estate Finance careers in Chicago. It was good to see how they used what they learned at DePaul in their  jobs. We toured a luxury condo bldg under construction on Michigan Avenue. We learned about financing new construction.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very fun, interesting, and useful class. Weekly online quizzes (easy), midterm, final, and 2 fun projects. Tells you what you need to study for the tests. Definitely recommend this class and the professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2008<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took for Urban Planning and Policy and class consisted of 1/2 watching a movie, 1/2 lecture and towards the end a urban planning project.  I got a B and usually get A's but pretty interesting. He is a tough grader on the paper and essays.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Bell really cares about his students, and it shows in class.  He always makes time for students.  Our class must have been hearing-deprived because they always asked q's that were similat to what he just said, but Bell is patient and understanding.  Exams arent too bad...study sessions b4.  Very, very knowledgable in RE and one of the best pr</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher.

Midterm & final come straight frm homework. Do your hw & you'll be fine. Try to do well in midterm, cause he might count that as final too (that's what he did Fall quarter).Will Learn alot.Smart guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2005<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the best teacher   midterm can be substituted for final atleast for our class  midterm is really easy  it comes str8 from the homework that he gives you the answer to</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The topics can be extremely confusing but he makes sure to use only the most basic questions on the tests.
