Throughout high school, I struggled with math, but Professor Farrell explains things very thoroughly and clearly. He has been teaching so long he almost knows exactly what will confuse students, and lectures accordingly. Great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ferrall does NOT know how to teach! His notes are SO UNORGANIZED!!.. it is ridiculous... He expects that you understand the homework problems so he doesn't go through them, and if you ask about a problem pertaining to a similar one he went over he won't go over it in class if you ask... don't recommend to people who struggle in math!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fantastic! all i can say. He is a brilliant teacher and you can actually call him up at any time you like if you need help. He gives you his residence number incase you need additional help. He is retired so has all the time in the world for his students. class is SUPER EASY and recommended for students who are DUMB in maths. Fantastic Teacher!</div></div></div></body></html>
