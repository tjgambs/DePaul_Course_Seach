He really goes above and beyond for his students. He makes you work hard for your grade and you learn alot. I would recommend taking Professor JP Class. He will teach you alot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2014<br>Class Name: TDC376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The network technologies (and possible network security) capstone. Mentally prepare yourself for this class because its going to take a lot of your time and effort. No screwing around or he will fail you, just do your best and you will pass, communicate with your group members effectively and often.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: TDC377<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard course, prepare to live in the lab and do a lot of self teaching.  Good teacher but at times seems arrogant or annoyed.  However, I would recommend that any networking major take this course with him so they can learn the pain of ASAs ahead of time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: TDC379<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most useful classes I took in the IASE degree.  Highly recommend for any networking or IT course work.  This is the CCNP route switch course.  Lots of work, but read the book cover to cover, do the labs, and you'll get a good grade.   The book is excellent!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2013<br>Class Name: CNS395<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Network Teacher at DePaul.  Prepare to work your ass off, but you will learn a lot.  If you are lazy, you will fail.  Take easy courses with this course, it is real work intensive.  However, you will learn a lot and you get what you put in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/28/2012<br>Class Name: TDC377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The best Professor at DPL, classes are challenging just as the real world, Network Capstone is very useful to get a grasp on  whats outside. Great Professor, better human being.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2011<br>Class Name: TDC376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Capstone. Expect to fall behind in your other classes. As always, you learn a lot in JP's courses. Kind of glad i'm done with his classes, but I also know i'm going to miss them. You can always count on learning so much when he is the professor. Went out for drinks on the last day of class, one of the best prof at DePaul without a doubt!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2011<br>Class Name: TDC379<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of in lab exercises, great hands on time especially if you don't have 5 Cisco routers at home... One of the best prof at DePaul. Love taking his classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2010<br>Class Name: TDC376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is very challenging class! Be warned, you will spend on average 20 hours per week! More towards the end. It's all about group work, so make sure all other members are doing their tasks! You will appreciate yourself at the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2010<br>Class Name: TDC376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he'll push you. you get out of the class what you put in. if you want to learn, you will. fair grader, willing to help you. i highly recommend this mandatory class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2010<br>Class Name: TDC365<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's phenomenal.

His class was more work than my other 3 classes combined but it was worth it. He knows his stuff and your time isn't being wasted by doing the homework and labs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2009<br>Class Name: TDC376<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be sure you know your subject before taking this class. you need a thorough knowledge of all the technical side of networking, this class is more about deadlines and group work, leave everything up to you. expect 20 hrs+ outside of class work every week. more towards the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: TDC365<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great professors u will learn lot from him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2007<br>Class Name: TDC376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you miss JP, you've wasted a good bit of your tuition. Easily one of the best instructors I've had at DPU. A long standing CCIE with experience in the real world, he knows his stuff. You won't BS your way through his class... Sorry to see DPU put him on hiatus just for not having his PhD. Silly rule.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: TDC379<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is easily one of the best professors I've EVER had. If you do not take a class with JP, you are missing out on one of DePaul's best professors. He teaches you A LOT, and makes you study hard, but he is an AMAZING professor. Do not pass the chance to take his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: IPD396<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>JP, is a good professor, he has good explanations, good homework. My only issue with JO was durng my presentation. It look like he did not place enough attention (he was rude) and there was no feedback on the presentation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: IPD396<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Smart, hilarious, passionate.  This guy will keep you engaged and interested!  Outstanding teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: TDC377TDC349<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE BEST TEACHER DePaul HAS! Awsome professor lots of fun. The classes are hard and he expects you to work for your grade. If DePaul ever loses him it would be a very big lose to the University. JP is very understand even though he gives lots of work but you WILL learn a lot in his classes. Simply the best teacher DePaul has.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2005<br>Class Name: TDC376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is very hard. You will never have a class like this anywhere, and you never had a class like this. His answers are vary vague you need to give detailed questions. If not he’ll answer with either a “yes” or “no”. This professor is so awesome because he is that damn good. Try to make friends with JP and your group members.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: TDC376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I've had 3 classes with JP, Network Capstone, TDC 377, and TDC 379, all great.  He'll push you to do good work.  Accept the challege and you'll do fine.  Do not expect to coast by in any of his classes. 379 is a must take for anyone wanting hands on network experience at Depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2005<br>Class Name: TDC377<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone that rights that this professor is good must have some personal tie to him. He is so condescending and arrogant.  If making you learn means threatening you with a failing grade and therefore making you self teach yourself he is great.  The proof is in the pudding, so many students fail his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2005<br>Class Name: TDC376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I had, very challenging but if you put in the efforts, the rewards, in term of academical and proffesional development, are great.  Sure he pushes you to learn a lot but this is great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: TDC376<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly challenging class, but also one of the most rewarding once you do finish. JP is nothing but helpful throughout, answering emails and giving just enough technical guidance to discover what you need to know. He won't give you the answer, true, but he will always point you in the right direction.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/22/2005<br>Class Name: TDC376<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>JP does not teach in this class.  Be prepared to find the answers to your technical questions from anywhere but him.  Do not take this in your last quarter before graduating in case you don't pass, not kidding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2005<br>Class Name: TDC379<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>JP pushes hard, but its only because he wants you to learn alot.  He is super knowledgable!  Best teachers I have had at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2005<br>Class Name: TDC377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult class, but teacher is excellent.  You can tell his has a passion for the subject.

If you have the chance and a enough free time take any one of his classes.
