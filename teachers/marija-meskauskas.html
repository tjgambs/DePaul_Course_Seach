Its chem you have to learn this stuff yourself and read before class and simply reinforce with the lecture. hard class, very hard, if you spend 15 hours a week on it you can get an A/B. The TA mike is awesome he holds 3 review sessions a week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2011<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not all bad. It is a tough course but if you put in enough work, you can get a B. She's not the best professor, but still not the worst.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2010<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was hard and Prof. Meskauskas isn't the best but certainly not terrible. Do the aleks assignments and stay on top of your work and you will do fine. I got an A- in CHE 111 after getting a C and two B-'s in Bio 101-103. I do okay in school and if I can get an A- in chem, you can too. It's really not as bad as it's made out to be.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2010<br>Class Name: CHE101G<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Since this is an intro course to a majors course series, it's intense but not intimidating. From experience all the chem profs are difficult, this prof's teaching style happens to work for me. No matter the chem prof, you will have to work hard in and (esp.) out of class. They know this and they'll help you as best they can, but you gotta work hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2010<br>Class Name: CHEM105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took her Intro Chemistry class as my scientific lab fulfillment.  She is no joke.  READ YOUR BOOK, it will save your life.  She drops one test grade, which is cool.  She has no mercy other than that as far as grading goes.  This lab was fun, just do your homework.  Good professor.  Very intelligent and wise.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2009<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I truly loved this professor, although I hate chemistry with a passion. She is tough but if you bring your book to class for lecture you get practice doing things that will be on the test. She loses her place at times but you can catch the mistakes ad fix them on your own paper, helps you learn too. Don't shy away from her she is really nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm a straight A student. I study hard, work hard, and go to class. This class KILLED ME. I have never studied so hard or worked so many hours outside of class. I pulled a C off. This class is HARD. The professor is very smart, but cannot teach the material in a comprehensible way. If you are not a science major...RUN.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2009<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of people have said some mean things, but in all honesty, she's not that bad at all. She tells you EXACTLY what's going to be on the test before we get them, she's to the point and does problems thatll be on the test on  board until you understand them. It's a hard class, if you don't pay attention at all you will fail...shes a good teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2008<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT take this professor if you have other options, especially if you are not a chem major.  Lectures are dull and useless, and have little relevance to the material you find on tests and quizzes.  She plays favorites, gets herself confused, & doesn't teach the relevant subject matter.  I am a straight-A student but am struggling to maintain a C.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: BIOCHSECT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Meskauskas is really intelligent and friendly, but she does expect you to get off your lazy buts and actually study! If you take this seriously, you will find her to be inspirational in the pursuit of chemistry learning! God Bless you!!! &gt;&lt;&gt;</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2008<br>Class Name: CHE104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY. I have never had a more useless, confused professor ! She's bitter, confusing, and condescending to everyone.  NON-SCI majors be warned.  She's not only tough, but she includes material on exams/quizzes that she doesn't even talk about in lecture.  No wonder we only ended up with SIX people in class. I can't believe she's still at Depaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2007<br>Class Name: CHE240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst professor ever at DePaul.  She should be asked to retire her seat so that someone else that is younger and has the ability to clearly teach students can join the faculty.  She uses the powerpoints provided by the book 4 lectures and literally reads off of them during lecture.  Then, her tests and quizzes have nothing to do w/ lect</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/25/2007<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's horrible, don't ask her for help, I'm in chem 113 right now with Dr. Wolbach and I learned more in the 1st 2 days than I did the whole 3 weeks of summer school with MM. She just does problems and doesn't tell you where the information is coming from, when you read make sure you understand fromthe book, because she doesnt help!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2007<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Meskauskas is a very nice professor. If you want to be successful in her labs, come prepared. She is always willing to help you learn more about chemistry. Before each lab she explains the experiment in an understandable way. I am glad that I had her the first two quarters.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2006<br>Class Name: CHE105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Meskauskas is a very nice lady.  People tend to blame their professor if they receive a bad grade, when really it is their lack of studying the gives them the mark!   She is really nice if you just go to her for help!  Don't be afraid!  Just study and stop being lazy!  And fyi, she does smile!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2006<br>Class Name: CHEM111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i had her for lab. i think because she's so old, she can't really relate to us younger people. i got yelled at her at least once a class, but overall i could handle her. i don't know. avoid her if you can, but she's not all bad in the end</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2006<br>Class Name: CHEM105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this in hopes of an easier science course. WRONG! She is a bitter old woman who offers no sympathy or helpfulness in her teaching style. Take BIO 101 instead, it will be easier.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2006<br>Class Name: CHE111115<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is probably the most bitter old woman I have EVER met. She chooses favorites, and when you're not one of them beware, she is degrading when you ask for help. She often makes you feel stupid on purpose. I would NEVER recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: CHE104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will learn a lot if you listen, however she is very tough, and its hard to know what exactly you need to study for.  I would recommend this if your interested and just want to learn.  If you want an easy grade, or your grade is a huge concern, be prepared and warned.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: CHEM104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this teacher i horrible...i havent taken chem since i was a soph in high school so when she starts talking i had no idea what she was talking about...for about half the quarter what she was teaching wasnt even in the book for our class she told us to go to the lib to find the info and on the midterm the avg was a d....dont take her ever!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2005<br>Class Name: CHEM101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher if you do your work.  The reason people fail this class is because they are stupid and don't study until the day before the exam.  Come on it is Chem 101!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2005<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>lets just say that this class and the teacher were impossible. Chemistry is hard and when u go to her for help, she doesnt help, just shrugs you off. I had a great gpa until i failed her class along with so many students...so, basically...dont take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2005<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not the best teacher...test were difficult, not adequetly prepared to teach in such a short time. too much stuff in little time.

A lot of people failed and a lot of people dropped but if you stick around and do your work you will pass, she is nicer and more helpful after the midterm.  Read the book, there are a lot of test&#63; from it and bring the book to class, it helps A LOT.  She is good for chem majors</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2005<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>about every persons grade in the class going into finals was a D. She is absolutely unbearable and the hardest teacher i have ever had! For the sake of your GPA, do not DO NOT DO NOT take her! Especially if chemistry is not your best subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Simply put: take another class or take another teacher.  If you do not understand chemistry **very** **well** going into this class then you will not do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: CHEMISTRY100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was not good at explaining, actually terrible, her assistant talked to students instead of helping or doing he work. The teacher for a basic class gave too much to do, read, study. She was confusing and most of us has no idea what she was talking about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: CHEM104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY! This class was horrible. She is the worst teacher I have ever had. Her tests and quizes are impossible. The stuff she asks is stuff that even she doesn't know. I have no idea how this woman is still teaching cuz she is terrible. Spare yourself the agony and keep away!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2004<br>Class Name: LAB<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did not like her. She is very unhelpful. She seems like she does not want to waste her time helping you. She treats one as if they are stupid, when you ask a question. Also, she just sits in her chair, unlike the TA who actually walks around to help. Very moody, I would not recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2004<br>Class Name: CHELAB<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was my lab instructor and had no idea what the lab was about.  Always asks her TA questions even though she is the instructor.  Her answers to questions were unclear.  For a lab instructor, she was tolerable, but I would never have her for a prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is hard. there is no way it is a 100 level class.  i worked my butt off in this class to get c's.  stay away if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2004<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of people were lost in the class.  She sometimes drifted off the subject and leaned into unrelated chem topics.  Her lectures were awful, the book gave me a better explanation than she did. I was lucky to get a decent grade in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2004<br>Class Name: CHE105<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For non-chemistry majors i can only say 1 thing:  &quot;good luck!&quot;  :(</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2004<br>Class Name: CHEM100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>how hard could a 100 level course be right&#63; Class average was a 64%...she is one of the worst teachers...quizes are impossible..midterm is impossible...hw is impossible....i attended every class and still was lost</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2004<br>Class Name: CHEM100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she is a really bad professor.

The lectures were quite bland. Quizes were difficult- she asked very detailed and obscure questions that weren't covered in the readings or lecture. Be prepared to read the text several times over and study hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2004<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class seemed hard at first, but after getting help from the professor things went well. If you are having problem just try to take notes, read, see professor, and go to tutoring. This is a great professor!</div></div></div></body></html>
