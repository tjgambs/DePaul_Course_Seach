    There is a midterm and a final. That is what your grade consists of. If you dont go to class, you will not pass! You have to stay up to date with the readings or else you will be completely lost during lecture. He is very knowledgeable with many years of experience. His tests are very tough but makes you think deeply. He talks about himself ALOT.

    The class of this instructor is unsystematic. From the side of a business student, there are too much academic papers to read. It looks like an academic class rather than a business class.

    Dr. Whittler is one of the best professors I've had at DePaul.  He is such an effective communicator that many of the concepts he taught still stays with me. Yes, his quizzes and exams are pretty difficult, meaning you need to know the concepts and know where and when to apply them. If you are a marketing major, I highly recommend you taking him.

    Senior reflecting on 2013 class.  sounds like many peeps are angry that Tommy doesn't use lectures to regurgitate things from the book. his lectures are interesting and his "Tangents"  give insight on his experiences as a consumer.  the tests are refreshing because it isn't just scantron. read the book and go to class, but don't overstudy

    I spent about 60 hours studying for this guys quiz, midterm, and final.  I study with quizlets, notes, and handout. Mr. Whittler "will" deceive you. A lot of his material is overlapping and unclear. He will grade you like he God and this is your only chance to survive. I didn't have a shot in the dark in passing this guys exams. I damned everyday!!

    Take anyone but Professor Whittler. His tangents teach you nothing about consumer behavior, and that about sums up every class meeting. He rants about Harley Davidson Motorcycles, cars, his cat, and other things that have to do with him. Professor Behavior would be a more appropriate course name. He does not use D2L+dishes harsh grades @ course end

    If other professors are available, take them. I didn't learn anything useful in this class which is a shame considering I was really looking forward to the subject. Most of class time is spent listening to him brag about his motorcycles, cat, and home. He is a nice guy, but I would steer clear of taking him if you intend on learning anything.

    This is one of the smartest Professors that has ever taught me. For the final and the midterm he gives you an outline of what you need to know. If you don't do the outline or some of the reading you will not do well on the exam. Tommy is a genius so his exams are not the easiest, but if you study for them you will do fine.

    This has been my favorite class thus far at DePaul. He makes you really learn all of the information. I found a huge interest in the subject didn''t study didn''t read the book and got an A. Not sure what these people are talking about. Highly highly recommend him and this class.

    This class is NOT that bad. He tells you what to study/read to succeed on the quiz/exams. Just make sure you understand the vocabulary and you'll pass. He's a very nice guy and very interactive.

    Makes it very difficult to pay attention.  Can only relate concepts to motorcycles, getting a deal in a purchase, and his cat.  Extremely difficult tests, you cannot get by with a tentative grasp of the subject, be sure to study hard if you want a decent grade.

    You will never learn so much in one class as you do in his Consumer Behavior course, but getting an A is tough. Although attendance isn't mandatory, its hard to get an A without attending class. Go to class, take notes, do the readings, and make sure to study and you'll do fine but his exams are super tough.

    Even though his exams are pretty tough, I have learned sooo much from this professor! If you're looking for knowledge then take him, you will learn a lot. He gives the best examples to help students comprehend material. His classes are hilarious :) If you're a marketing major I recommend you take him, you won't regret it (unless you just want an A)

    He's great! Nothing he does is traditional, which makes it interesting. He engages you into a lot of real life experience. Take a lot of notes with the outline he provided. Do the study guide and readings. His tests are hard, lots of short answers and cross word for the final. Do the extra credit! 2 tests, 1 quiz, 3 extra credit.

    Class is very engaging and fun! His exams are a little tricky, used flashcards for the exams and was fine. Not an easy A class, tests your ability to be efficient with time and ability to listening. However the information I learned was applicable to every day life. Can't say that about many classes.

    One of the best professors I've had at DePaul. His class was very rewarding. I gained tons and tons of knowledge and insight. All of his personal stories help you understand the class criteria in a clear way! His tests aren't easy, but if you study you can do well. I would definitely recommend you to take him! You would be missing out if you don't.

    do not take unless you want to fail. he is an awesome guy don't get me wrong, his class is fun, BUT he does not assign any homework or anything to help compensate your grade for if you do bad on the midterm and final. so basically, if you do bad on either test (WHICH YOU WILL BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE) you automatically fail the class.

    While Tommy's class was not one of the easiest classes I've taken, it is one of the classes that I've learned the most in. His tests aren't the easiest but he makes them that way so people actually learn the material. I barely read either of the text books but I went to class, took notes, and ended up with an A in the class.

    I did not enjoy this class at all.  He only rambles during his lectures and than tells you to read from two differenct textbooks, yet never tells you what chapters you should read.  In addition his exams are ridiculous; it is al ljust short answer and fill in the blank.

    Great professor. Very funny in a quirky way -- loves to talk about his weird consumer tendencies and his love for basketball -- but also very knowledgeable about the subject. Interesting class and he makes it even more interesting with his discussion. I learned a lot in his class and if you study your notes and handouts, you should do well.

    DON'T BUY THE TEXTBOOK! Everything you need to do well on exams is through powerpoints &amp; handouts; take notes &amp; study them! These "nasty" reviews are deceiving. He is an awesome professor...the best &amp; I'm a Finance major. I was uneasy about taking his class, but am glad I did. You learn a lot about psychology &amp; how it applies to consumers behavior.

    Great Professor. I learned a great deal in his class. Tests are tricky, but if you show up to class and ready the notes and readings, you should be able to get an A or B. Final is tougher than midterm. He is very helpful and enjoyable to listen to. I would take another class of his in a second.

    Tommy is an excellent professor! I wasn't sure about taking him after reading the reviews here but im so happy i did!! the classes are interesting, the tests are NOT hard if you at least read over your notes. I enjoyed doing the crossword on the final, it's not hard at all. I recommend taking him if you can, you will not be sorry.

    He is a very good professor. He uses real life examples and clearly explains the materials. His handouts help ALOT! His tests are very difficult when you don't know the material, but he is very clear that you will know what the answers are. Tests are application based and not just definition. But overall, he is my favorite professor at DePaul!

    Great professor, makes class very interesting with a lot of real world and funny examples/stories. Make sure you know your stuff because he grades on your total comprehension of the material not just memorization of terms. He is a tough grader on tests/quizes.

    Whittler is the man. His class is very entertaining. Tests come in a variety of forms such as a crossword puzzle, etc. He challenges you. Take good notes! Tests you on everything he says in class but reiterates whats important by repeating it over and over. Participate, take good notes and study them youll do fine. He looks for effort. Recommended!

    This class is very hard. The tests are impossible, with all the information we have to memorize. The professor talks about how he saves money &amp; some examples are helpful but not a lot. If your not interested in psychology, b/ the class is 75% psychology, then your not going to like this class. Also lots of reading, and memorizing terms.

    Tommy is great.  His class isn't a walk in the park but you actually LEARN.  Don't buy a book. Study your notes. If anything is unclear talk to him during office hours. He's always willing to help. Midterm and final basically make up the class so make sure you have the material down. Class goes by so quickly. Fun teaching style. TAKE HIM!

    Midterm was pretty easy, however some questions were very tricky. Tommy keeps class interesting but his grading is based on a midterm and final. The final had a crossword, which was very hard. He is manageable to get a B in, but it is hard to ace his tests.

    Tommy's a great professor! He makes class fun and lively. His only downfall is that he has no &quot;real world&quot; experience and all of his examples are from the 80's and 90's. I wanted more current examples of how I can apply consumer behavior to my job today. But take Tommy if you want a fun, interesting, and relatively easy class!

    These reviews scared me when signing up and turned out the be one of my favorite classes. Simply attend each class and take notes which will make text unnecessary. For tests study all vocab and definition and you will do fine. He talks up the book a lot, but really he is such a great teacher that I never refer to the book. Very interesting class.

    I am an accounting major and so I'm not really into marketing. Tommy is the best, he is so enthusiastic and I truly enjoyed attending his lectures. His exams are tough, but if you pay attention in class and study a moderate amount, you will get an A. I would recommend him to anyone, regardless of your major.

    Great Professor. You earn the grade you deserve. He's a tough grader, but he gives a study guide for midterm &amp; final(that accounts for 95% of the exam). All I basically did was study my notes &amp; powerpoints. If something was unclear, then I turned to the book. I got an A.

He's very interesting, relates every concept to the real world experiences, gives notes, study guide (which accounts for 95% of the Midterm and Final).What more can you ask for&#63; You earn the grade you deserve in this class, and &quot;just getting by&quot; will not cut it.

    I recommend avoiding him unless you are really into marketing. For people who simply need to take it, you will regret it. Don't get me wrong, he is an awesome guy, very friendly , very very interesting. However when it comes to test time, it's as if you are in a different world. You need to memorize every single thing to do well or love marketing

    I would differ with some comments out here, Prof Whittler is one of the nicest and most helpful professors. His exams are tough, but the final had a bit of fun too. You really need to know your stuff if you want to get good grades. I got an A, so I cant complain.

    Where do i start with this class.  The professor is awsome he is funny and very intaligent, but boy is he hard.  Take a different proffesor if you can because his final will kick your butt.  There are only 3 possible grades, midterm, final and a project.  he offers extra credit but if you don't get a 100 on all of them he will not count it

    Great class. VERY interesting! you can tell dr. whittler really loves marketing--he's always bringing in articles to help explain concepts. Class consisted of midterm, portfolio, and final. i thought test was easy...most don't though. portfolio was just plain fun! he tells you to read the book, but as long as you pay attention you won't have to.

    He is a nice guy. However, he knows little about advertising. I thought this class would be case study based, it's not. I'm disappointed. Too much theory and few (not that many) real life examples in class. Not once did we discuss a major advertising camapign. Whittler should stick to teaching MKT 310.

    How could this prof. get a bad rating&#63;&#63; Class consisted of a midterm, final, and research paper. The research paper was easy as long as you follow his guidelines, and the exams are hard because there's a lot of info but he gives you review sheets to study from with exactly what you need to know. Just study and you can easily get an A.

    Don't take this professor if you plan on an easy A. Only 4/45 students in quarter get an A. he says that. His exams are comprehensive. No study guide. One paper worth more than the midterm. Only 10 extra credit points towards exams. Overall, he is good prof. but his testing is poor. watch out! pay attention.

    One of the best professors I ever had in all my 6 years of college experience.  He is a hard professor but he's good because he gets you into the subject and makes me think critically. Exams are hard but it's college. It should be. He'll make you feel good because he takes the time to know your name. He prefers to be called Tommy.

    His teaching style is different, it definitely takes some getting used to. I did like his class though, and he definitely broadened my horizon in some respects. Pay lots of attention to his handouts and don't fall asleep in class otherwise you will easily get lost! Lots of conceptual work!

    One of the best and hardest teachers at DePaul.  Make sure you read the book, go to class every day and take notes.  Tests are very different than anything else at Depaul, especially the last final question :-).  Best advice, study for the class, and try not to stress out too much over the tests, it all works out in the end.

    There is definitely a method to his madness.  His wild examples are to better understand the marketing concepts.  Listening would have made that clear.  His exams are difficult, but why should they be easy&#63;  We're paying a lot of money.  We should be challenged.  Those who are complaining obviously weren't ready for it.

    Tommy is a good guy, but a bad teacher. He always talked about stuff that never mattered in regards to marketing. Tommy, get a real job, teaching isnt for you man. His class wasnt hard, it was just the most worthless one i took at depaul.

    Not a good teacher, his classes are more of a casual chat and not reallu a meaningful lecture. He is a bad paper grader becuase all he cares about is spelling and mechanical stuff, he doesn't care about what you wrote, IS THIS MARKETING OR COMPOSITION&#63;&#63;&#63;

    Tommy is a really fun teacher. I saw many people complaining about his tests but that's only because they didn't study. As long as you come to class and get his handouts you should get at least a B! I didn't even read the book.

    Be prepared to study. If u do...not hard to get a good grade. Class grade is based on: mid-term, final, and paper.  Hard tests..grades paper easy as long as u follow guidelines. Class was interesting!

    Prof. Whittler is a great teacher but he tends to get off subject a lot, although you will never be bored in his class, be prepared to study REAL HARD for his exams, they are EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.  Bottom line: great teacher, but his exams are way, way, too difficult

    Don't let the negative responses on here scare you from taking him. He's really a great guy!  He's probably my favorite DePaul professor.    Enthusiastic about the subject.  Very helpful.  He gave me great career advice.  I'm glad I took his class and got to know him.

    This class was not the easiest A, but Tommy definetly gives everyone a fair chance.  His tests are a little challenging, but I paid attention to example test questions he gave in class, it was the most helpful in how to learn the material. Also, helpful were the extra credit assignments.

    Extremely difficult professor.  His favorites in the class are the kids who participate.  Participation can jump your grade from a C to a B or B to an A.  If your not a talker don't take his class.  Midterm and Final beyound challenging. Most show for all classes...

    Tommy's a great teacher. He really cares about his students. Not that much homework and gives extra credit. If you go to class and take notes, you'll do really well in the class. I was terrified when I enrolled into the class due to the respeonses on here, but Tommy's one of my favorite prof. now.

    Talks about himself all the time. His choppers, his suits, his past, his dad, his bla bla bla... Anything but Marketing. I got B+ in that class, and I wish he'd put half as much effort into teaching as he did into deriving my percentage so it would come out to B+, and not A-.

    The tests can be difficult, but if you go to class you will do alright. He uses his personal experiences to demonstrate the concepts. I liked this class, and if you try you will do alright. Also, he likes students that participate.

    He is an extremely nice guy, and very informative.  His stories do get off track at times but it makes the class a LITTLE more interesting.  Exams are a KILLER, I suggest that you study!  You will definately have a brain-overload when he is done with you!

    Super nice guy, but crappy teacher. His crossword puzzle midterms are pointless and so are the papers and presentations. If you can take someone else, do so right away. The stuff he teaches in class have nothing to do with the tests, so read the book.

    If you like teaching yourself take his class, but if you want a teacher to do their job and teach you don't take his class.

    Horrible.  Always talked off the topic but then wanted to test you on the book material.

    Seems like a great man to know outside of the classroom. He will not make any references to the book, but all tests are based on the material in the book. My suggestion- teach yourself the stuff in the book and just show up for the tests!
