The class was boring, although a handful out of the multitude of stories he told were interesting. Simulation was intense and I am glad I do not have to take this class again. He was nice, and I did well in the class, but I prefer a different teaching style.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2014<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HIM. Lectures were boring and test is nothing related to the lecture. I never got a B in my life and ended up with a B in his class. One page of notes allowed for midterm and final. Buy the text book because you might be better off staying at home and read the book by yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2014<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Galka brings a lot of real world experience to the classroom, but I did not appreciate his teaching style. Midterm and Final were open note and straight from the textbook. The case studies did not seem really connected to the rest of the course. The marketing simulation was really fun and time consuming. Half of the course was group work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2013<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is a basic marketing class do not expect more than that. Took it online, was well structured and organized. Extensive use of text book but also supports with case studies and videos. Grades fairly, has weekly textbook chapter and video quizzes with casestudy, a final exam and a marketing audit assignment. I would take more classes he offered.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2013<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took the online section. Quizzes and final exam come directly from the book. (No midterm.) Large amount of group work. Professor's grading was hard to predict. Seemed to reward quantity over quality. Gave each group 100 percent on final project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2013<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Expectations were unclear and I would receive 75% on all of my case assignments because my answers did not agree with his opinions. Marketing case studies are highly subjective and points should not be taken off if students state their opinion and back it up with information from the book/class. Very disappointed with this graduate course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2012<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Assignments were very unclear, requirements changed frequently and often were contradictory.  Examples were completely outdated.  The text is relied upon heavily, so go ahead and buy it straight away.  I found him to be frequently rude to students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2012<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took the online section of his class. Overall it was organized well, but he went with a new edition of the text and didn't take the time to update his lesson plans accordingly since it had some significant changes. The class was pretty easy, and I learned a few things. He was also helpful, although sometimes not very clear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2012<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful professor. He has a lot of experience in the field and always explains all the concepts with his stories (which makes it easier to memorize and understand). Very smart guy, One of the best at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2011<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took his online MKT55 course, it was very informative and the most well laid out online course that I have taken.  He has video lectures that you watch so that you are not just reading the book the whole time.  The marketing game is super fun and I learned a ton from professor Galka!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2011<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor has no knowledge of the area in which he teaches. He assigns tons of busy work (none of which is designed to make you learn). He has poor teaching methods. He has unfair grading practices. One should avoid him at all costs. DePaul has picked a poor choice in allowing this man to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2011<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Useless class. Useless professor. I'm convinced the only reason he teaches is because he wants a captive audience to hear his stories. His stories are almost all irrelevant to the course and some are clearly fabricated. He is also difficult to deal with one-on-one. I'm disappointed in DePaul's choice to teach this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Galka has so much real world experience. He used to do marketing for casinos in Las Vegas. Quizes seem harmless and are fairly easy but they ADD UP. Try to well on them. There's only 300 points in the class & the quizes are worth 60 total. Same w the newspaper articles. He is fairly easy if you listen in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2010<br>Class Name: MKG555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What a joke. There was no class interaction, only him telling some tired, out of touch stories. Only saving grace was The Marketing Game, I might as well had never gone to class. He bought an all denim Levi suit in the 70s. This sums up what I learned from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just memorize the chapters word for word and do the quizzes online. Study aid for midterm & final one page back & front. Was doing great in his class, however his final was bogus and brought me down from an A- to a B, no sympathy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2010<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is wonderful. I love his storytelling, all good examples from real life. Yes, he does care about his students. The class is interesting, makes me change my opinion about MKT as a whole. Two easy tests, he lets you use 1 page w/ notes; and some extra HW. Not hard at all, you will learn while you are having fun. He is full of energy also</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy's hilarious!

That comes from the weekly quizzes. he goes over everything in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best class ever!  This guy is brilliant.  The marketing game was very interesting and taught me some neat concepts.  Based on the class material, I got a business idea which I am now pursuing.  Dont miss his class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2009<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wish I had taken someone else.  Doesn't believe in curves.  Allows &quot;cheat sheet&quot; for exams, but they are still hard and cover insane amounts of pointless marketing definitions.  Gives a study guide that basically just says &quot;Know everything&quot; so I really do not know what is the point.  I just hate marketing in general though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/02/2009<br>Class Name: MKT530<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice prof, long winded and talks all class.  Put into groups and evaluate a case each week, pretty easy though.  Low interaction in class.  Must study text and notes to get A on exams.  Learned some, but could have been more interesting.  Overall, not that difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2008<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, talks a ton, but class is only 2 hours so its not bad. Tests are way too long and his questions can be very vague (although right from the book). He does allow a cheat sheet for the exam, although it was more trouble than it was worth.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2008<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found this course to be manageable. You're allowed a &quot;cheat sheet&quot; for the exams (midterm and final) but it is still necessary to understanding the concepts and know how to apply them for the exams. Questions are from the book. One interesting group project. Professor talks a lot! We rarely took a break during the lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2008<br>Class Name: MGT555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>According to prev review,his test is open book.However, when I took it,he only allowed us for 8.5 x 11 double sided cheet sheet during the test which we need to fit in for like 5 or 6 chapters.It doesn't really HELP !! Why&#63; Because his test is way TOOOOOO SPECIFIC.Some of the questions are just out of the blue.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2008<br>Class Name: MRKTG530<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I do not feel that his tests really test wether i know the topic.His intention is much more to trick us than really find out if we know the materials. Even though he says participation is required he likes to hear himself talk so much that its hard to get a word in!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2008<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good guy who enjoys teaching the class.  Marketing simulation game was definitely the highlight.  Lectures can be somewhat lackluster with a fair amount of sales stories to more or less give examples of the concepts.  Exams are straightforward and open book.  Overall an okay experience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2008<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not bad gives extra credit at the end of the course. his projects are easy but make sure to study for his tests becasue they will ask you to recall details that difficult to remember if you have not studied</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2007<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.

Interesting real-life stories, although sometimes he would repeat the same story multiple times.
