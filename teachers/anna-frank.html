Just show up, pay some attention, jot down a few notes and do the discussion questions.  She really works hard to get everyone involved and sometimes goes out of her way to work with students to succeed. Thumbs up to her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/29/2011<br>Class Name: PE273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!

She is really friendly, understanding, and responsive. I took the class online in a 5 week period, so there was a lot of work due each week. Dr. Frank was very understanding of assignments that were a little late as long as everything was fully done and worked with everybody to make the class manageable. Love her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: PE273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures are alright.  The final project for edu majors is time consuming.  She gives you a study guide for the exams but its a lot of memorizing crap.  Not the blowoff class i anticipated but not too hard either.  Ani's a great professor, she knows a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: PE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ani is awesome.  She will do everything she can to help students out and is very clear about what is expected from you in her classes.  She did everything she could to help me graduate on time and it worked out great</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: PE273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ani is awesome!!! The class was interesting, TONS of info. but she provides study guides with EXACTLY what is on the test...if you know it, you'll get an A.  The end of term project was fun but time consuming.  If you are willing to put a little effort in the class is interesting and well worth your time!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: HEALTHNUTRI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome class. ani is so friendly. she is so passionate about teaching this class. interesting class if you are into health. there are 3 exams, fairly easy (curved), and a final project. i love ani!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2004<br>Class Name: PE273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A great class with a great professor. She really works with the student and the information learned from the course is vital not just to your future profession but to your everyday health practices.

All you have to do is take notes form the powerpoints and come to class. she likes you if you participate but it isn't a must. i liked her alot, learned alot and would definitley take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: PE341<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr Frank is a tremendous asset to depaul. she is the ultimate profesional and hot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2004<br>Class Name: PE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Frank is so helpful and really wants to see her students succeed. Contrary to the statement below, she is a very good teacher and knows a lot about the subjects she teaches. She has been the most helpful professor in the PE program. She's a great prof</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2004<br>Class Name: PE273<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not a good teacher.  All she does is go through slide shows on power point and doesn't explain anything.  I did not learn a single thing, and her tests are hard, and her end of the term project is also pointless.  I would NOT take her again.</div></div></div></body></html>
