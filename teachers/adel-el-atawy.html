    He is a good guy. He tries to help you grasp the concepts of the course. He is a little hard to understand though. If you understand networking, I'd suggest him..if not i'd stay away..

    Great guy and really knows what he's talking about. I would say he's an expert in the field. He really tries to get you to understand the course. There are quizes and midterm and final to help out but if you pay attention you should get it. Overall great course and I learned a lot.
