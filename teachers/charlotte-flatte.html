She spent a whole hour and a half just teaching us the law of signs. She's not very personable and has not bothered to learn a single students name. Rather than helping us herself she sends us to tutors. Has very thick Russian accent as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/31/2006<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not understand at all.. take this class if you work better teaching yourself the material from a book.

When you read these things you say &quot;I can't believe them&quot;, well believe me!! she does not talk to you AT ALL, only at the board the whole time... she explains things in strange formulas, the class is extremely easy though, you sign in an can leave because she doesn't ever look at the class or knows </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought that she was a good teacher. She is really helpful and she always ask if she could help you understand. The people that rated her never asked for help!!!!!!!!! I have an A cause you get extra points on your grade for particpation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>had an accent.took a class to get used to but after that she is fine.people give her bad rap for it and she is older and sort of boring...had easy assignmnets a midterm and final..very easy..she explains everything and doesnt move on till you know...i thought she was a great teacher..sometimes a lil boring but other then that i would take her again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't think I understood a word she said the entire quarter. If you know that calc. or any advanced math is not your strong suit, I highly recommend that you avoid Flatte.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms Flatte is not a good teacher because she is boring and her attitude is unprofessional. She has an accent that I can't comprehend. I recommend that you don't take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2004<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I couldnt understand one word this lady said, seriously go back to Russia.  I continuously asked her to spend some time to help me with the hw, but she referred me to the tutors.  Her tests had no resemblance to any of the hw or any of the topics she discussed in class.  Grading was unfair.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2004<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She tries to be helpful but because of her accent shes hard to understand. Also, sometimes when you ask why she did something she just says &quot;That's how you do it.&quot; Veyr nice lady though and tests aren't very hard. My midtrem took 20 minutes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2004<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, the accent is quite strong, but she knows her stuff, and explains everything VERY well at a slow pace. Her tests contain half of the problems directly from h.w. she is also very helpful outside of class. Lets just say to get a 100% on her tests is not that difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2004<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The material itself is easy.  Her accent makes her difficult to understand at first, but you get used to it.  She is not helpful at all though.  I had a question about a grade on my hw and she gave me the number of her grader and told me to call him, instead of fixing it herself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/26/2004<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bad teacher does not explain anythign just does example after example and is the most boring teacher on the face of the earth..and her tests are hard</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2004<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does have an accent, but I did not find it hard to understand her.  I think that she is a very good teacher. She has an original style of teaching, a little messy on the blackboard and at times hard to follow. She'll help you on tests if you're stuck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2004<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her accent is slavic, not French.  She knows her stuff, but is kinda intimidating, what with the fact that she sounds like Stalin.  She's also a little strict with tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2004<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i couldnt imagine taking her for a tough class. just a terrible, terrible teacher. cant understand a word she says, has no grip on the class at all. reminds me of a junior high environnment. i dig them polish women though...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2003<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's awesome, but she does have an accent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2003<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was one of the worst professors I've had here!  She has a thick French accent, and if you don't understand the work, she makes you feel stupid.  If you have a choice, don't take her!</div></div></div></body></html>
