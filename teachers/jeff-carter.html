    While his class may be pretty easy, they are insanely boring. Each one feels like eternity and it's  very dry material. Class is mandatory. He docks you marks every time you miss class and if you don't participate. Focal points are rough and boring no matter what you take but this one I wouldn't take again.

    Jeff is a really fun guy to be around! By no means is he easy, he will challenge you but it is only because he wants to see you succeed. He is one of the best art professors here.

    Art &amp; technology, not photoshop like i thought, he will challenge the way art is defined in your mind. Fun discussion heavy class, learn about some cool art, and even fantasize about your own art in a paper. Fun class, just participate and you're guarenteed a B- do the work and get a B+ really do the work and get an A

    jeff -very easy on the eyes ;] hehe. Otherwise, the class was enjoyable. (ART &amp; TECH. FOCAL POINT). He is very knowledgeable &amp; intrigued by what the students have to say. Be prepared to discuss, that in fact was my favorite part of class. This class will teach you to look at art a bit more modernly &amp; appreciate abstraction from the norm.

    Prof. Carter is genuinely a nice guy.  He tends to talk a lot, and reiterate things he's already said, though.  If you participate in the critiques it will be appreciated, he likes it when other people talk too.  generally easy-going even for you non-art types.  I would take him again.

    Like some others who have posted here, I have a mini-crush on Jeff.  He is just such a nice guy and is incredibly helpful, even if it didn't have to do with his class!  His classes are really fun and I liked the projects and exercises.  I wish I could take more classes with him, but he unfortunately doesn't teach any design courses!  Take him!

    I took his art and technology focal point class and it was kind of cool. There were trips to the art institute and presentation. Most of the class is looking at slides, discussions, readings from packets, and meeting artist. really easy and interesting. he's laid back and helpful.

    Prof. Carter is a really easy going guy who is always willing to help out.  He grades easily and doesn't care too much if you get to class late.  Fun to talk to, good assignments, definitely take him.

    a really nice guy  grades pretty fairly  would definately recommend for non-art majors too.  the only catch is that all of your art HAS to have some deeper meaning he hates cliches.  a lot of thought goes into this class but the creating process itself is pretty fun (1 short paper 3 projects 1 final)

    Great teacher who is very helpful. Non-art majors, don’t be scared because you can easily get a A if you at least try in the class. At first I had no interest in art but after I have a whole new perspective. Just do the work and you’ll be fine…I recommend to everyone.

    This was the best art class EVER!!!  Not to mention he is nice, hot, and helpful.  Make sure your work has a deeper meaning and comes from the heart and you will do just fine.  Don't look like a slacker in class-he likes to see his students take initiative. Did I mention I had a crush on him&#63;

    I had Jeff for Art and Technology Focal Point and he's a really cool guy. You can tell sometimes that thinks he knows more then people by the way he responds to their comments but that's probably because he does. Pretty simple class, look at slides, movies, 3 papers, visiting artists.

    PROFESSOR CARTER MADE ART VERY ENJOYABLE FOR NON-ART MAJORS.  THE 3 PROJECTS WERE A LOT OF FUN AND HE GIVES YOU STUDIO TIME TO WORK AND DISCUSS YOUR PROJECTS WITH OTHERS IN THE CLASS.  HE ALSO PLAYS COOL MUSIC DURING STUDIO TIME.

    You're missing out if you don't take a class with Carter. 3 big assignments &amp; one paper- nothing out of the ordinary about that, but you better be a talker. The more informed you are, the better. I adore him.

    Ok teacher, is a little full of himself and sometimes acts too cool, but is genuine and always helpful. Wasn't exactly right for this class, he would be better critiquing more experienced artist or a theory class.

    A bit hard. This prof is probably better at giving you the information you need to start creating art then actually helping you create the art. Would make a great art theory prof. You decide... he's gorgeous.
