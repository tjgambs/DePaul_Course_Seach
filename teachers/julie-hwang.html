Has issues with teaching/explaining things with a big picture point of reference. Good person, not a good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2011<br>Class Name: GIS123<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I can't believe people are bashing Dr. Hwang. I had most of my GIS courses with her and I can honestly say that she is a genius in the GIS field. At times the class is a little dry but she does teach every thing you need to know about GIS (from theory to practice). She is hard but so is GIS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2009<br>Class Name: GEO241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated this class, and dreaded going for three hours every week.  I was happy as soon as class was over.  I thought she taught assuming that everyone knew about GIS and was an expert.  I still barely know what GIS is.  I had to teach myself and get help from fellow classmates.  I don't recommend this class, unless you are an expert in GIS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: GIS242<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Julie is awesome. There is a little bit of a language barrier at times, but nothing to worry about. She's cool and understanding</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2007<br>Class Name: GEO241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A word of advice: No matter how good you may be at GIS, your skill is of no importance in this class. Prof Hwang is all about describing rather than doing. Tests are mostly based on textbook reading, the other part map execution. Even if you do great on the maps and labs, you MUST be ready to answer a full length essay on pointless terminology.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2007<br>Class Name: GEO241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this teacher was just plain bad cant teach your left there with hard computer projects to do things on your own the teacher aid was way more helpful then her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: GEO241<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a good professor for someone who was just starting out! She reacts well to participation and in class discussions. People complain about her accent, but she's not hard to understand. Most people I know are lazy and wanted to use that as their excuse. Her accent was very clear. I recommend her. Just go in with an open mind and you'll do fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2007<br>Class Name: GEO241<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher was not helpful at all. She might know the material herself but she does not know how to make her students understand it. She can't teach it well at all. If it wasn't for the lab assistant I would have failed the class. She always loves when students talk in class, but not many people know what is going on so they have nothing to say</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: GEO241<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unfortunately not a teacher interested in teaching the students how and why the labs are done.</div></div></div></body></html>
