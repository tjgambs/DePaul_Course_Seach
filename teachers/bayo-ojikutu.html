    Took him for 111 and 112. Both great classes. Great guy. Class is always very interesting. I skipped his class once and I actually felt bad for doing so haha. Opens your eyes to a whole lotta things. His LSP classes are pretty easy, you do have to participate though!

    I love Ojikutu, seriously adore him. He really opens your eyes to a lot about the Black Migration to Chicago. He is a novelist himself and very passionate about the subject. He expects a lot on papers but its totally worth the work.

    My favorite teacher at DePaul by far. He gets you to think about things in a way you never would have thought of. You discuss things like the definition of race. Get to know him because if you do hell care about you as a person not just a student. He is hard, because he is smart but its not hard to get a good grade if you put a little effort.

    Professor is very interesting. He is very intelligent and witty. He leaves any sort of political correctness behind and gets to the true root of why things happen. He is always there to help personally and professionally and takes deep interest in his students. I would take another class from him anytime.

    He was decent. Four books for this class which you hardly use..I'd recommend borrowing them for the library which will save you about $100. He tends to mumble and his handwriting is horrible.  He's kinda boring and uses too many big words..like he can't say what he wants simply and wants to show off his vocabulary.  Overall I'd give the class a C

    Those who rate him poorly have ridiculously high standards for people. He's great! He's smart, funny, helpful, knowledgeable. Granted, he mumbles a lot but it's a kind of enlightened Einsteinian sort of scattered-brained mumble. And, yeah, he isn't particularly organized, but, in exchange, there's lenience on his part. I'd recommend.

    The class was not completely organized, so it was a little frustrating never really knowing details about assignments. The actual class was a good class to take. Very useful workshops. The most helpful part of this class were the peer workshops.

    His writing is attrocious and he often requires you to write down random thoughts he has, but no one can even come close to how much he knows about the subject. He is quite funny, and very approachable. Only lectures, and they are quite boring, but very informative.

    He may have an impressive vocablary, but everything he says is repetitive, and his lectures are unhelpful. We only has class once a week,  but he often did not show up, and he seemed to see no problem with this. He assigned papers only 2 days before the day they were due, one of which was the Sunday after Halloween. I am not a fan.

    Did not really understand what he was talking about.  He mumbles threw things and goes off on tangents.  Does not help students when they need it.  Really difficult to deal with.  I understand that hes a published writer but I don't think he has any business teaching.

    This professor is incredibly intelligent, passionate &amp; inspiring. He will make you think &amp; question the way you view yourself and the world around you. Plus, he is a novelist. His assignments were not the easiest but I greatly enjoyed them &amp; learned a lot... Finished w/ an A, so it was worth it.

    very smart, very funny guy. Yes he tends to ramble on on his lectures..but he is very intelligent. very willing to give feedback for papers. READ the books and participate in class and you will do fine. 1 pop quiz, 1 paper, 1 test, 1 final paper. not too demanding. easy load. easy A, would recommend

    no one could understand anything he said. its the way he talks and writes. i had to send an assignment to my mother who is a writer and an editor to have her decipher it for me. it took her half an hour to try and figure out what he wanted us to do. he also insulted me in an email when i asked for help. also a tough grader.

    Great professor, class discussions are not only about the readings but he also relates them to real world situations. He is very knowledgeable and makes class interesting. He does mumble sometimes but if you listen to what he's saying, he's probably cracking a joke. He's awesome, take him!

    Ojikutu does not organize class time and discussions well. This was a workshop class and people were giving more feedback than the class time permitted and Ojikutu did not stop them. The class went on overtime into spring break. The professor does mumble and his instructions are unclear and not directed at the students.

    He was so unorganized and was 2 weeks late getting my rough draft back to me.  It should have taken him one night to do it... tthats how it was with everyone else's paper!  Also we learned maybe 3 concepts the first week of classes and after that we did absolutely nothing.  Hands down worst english teacher ever, i dont know why depaul keeps him!!!!

    Awful.  He speaks to the chalkboard and mumbles.  His assignments are unclear.  He cancelled class and graded papers during class time.  He makes waste of class time like its his job. Some of the ideas discussed are interesting, but the man has attitude!  He is argumentative and arrogant.  DO NOT TAKE...WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!

    Great teacher. Realy deep conversations. He let us know that the only thing that matters is the assignments (we only had 4 for the whole semester) it didn't feel like you had to do the readings as long as you where able to give civilized discouse. DON'T DO THE JOURNALS TILL THE LAST DAY He usualy forgets about them anyway!

    I would not recommend his class.  Assignments were unclear, his lectures had absolutely nothing to do with English and he handed back 2 of the almost 15 assignments we had in class.  If you are looking for an easy class, take him.  If you want to learn something, i'd look somewhere else.

    Professor Ojikutu was probably my favorite professor in my first quarter at DePaul.  Class was mostly discussion, with him stopping every once in a while to make sure we stayed somewhat on topic.  He never shut anyone down in class simply for espousing an opposing viewpoint.  Which is important at an often blindly liberal school such as DePaul.

    One of the best professors I have ever had.  The smartest teacher and definately showed that in class.  Fair grader, but was slow at grading them.  He was very insightful and was a pleasure to listen to.  Drifted at times, but we an amazing professor.  Get him he's awesome!!

    Bayo is great.  He's an awesome guy, and a really talented author (read 47th Street Black, and he has a new one coming out).  His lectures aren't that helpful, but he's really more of a creative writing expert and putting up with clauses and warrants would be tough for anyone.  Definitely recommend him, very easy grader too.

    Do you think HE likes teaching a boring research class&#63; I mean, the man writes fiction novels! He tries to make the class as interesting as possible.  He's very intelligent, super cool, and willing to listen to the insane idiotic babble and b.s. topics people would come up with in class. The class was only painful when moronic students would speak.

    He is by far one of the best professors I have had at DePaul yet. He is very intelligent and is always willing to meet with students outside of class. Ojikutu will not waste your time or money, he is well worth every dollar spent. Who ever wrote those negative comments must not like to be challenged, we are in college, its time to grow up.

    Well, he is a nice guy, but sometimes his supposed lectures seem like he's rambling and he goes off on random tangents. Tough Grader&#63; I wouldnt say so. We didnt really stay productive in class at all, just did a few papers. You don't really &quot;put forth&quot; effort in this class.

    The MOST bias teacher I have ever met. Journals&#63; They are soo stupid! He doesn't even check them! Can we say mumble&#63;! I repeatidly asked him to speak up but he just snubbed me away. I got a B and an african-american that never showed up got an A. ****&#63;! I think so. Waste of time class.

    The discussions were amazing if you enjoy opinions and debates.  Very interactive, but he sometimes would blabber on these rants that never ended but it doesn't matter because you can tune him out and he still thinks you are listening.  Overall, great teacher.

    He is the most intellegent person I have had for a teacher.  A lot of his discussions are very deep but he involves everyone of his students to make class fun.  All the readings are easy but you have to make sure you pay attention to them if you plan on geting a good grade on the papers.  Take him!

    Bayo is an AWESOME teacher! His only request is that you put forth effort in his class, and if you do, he will try and assist you in any way possible- he even meets outside of his office hours if a student is having problems- he is an amazing professor!!!
