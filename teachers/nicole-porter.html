While I was not as disciplined as I'd have like while in her class, the material still resonates and applies to my live nearly a decade later.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2009<br>Class Name: INDEP399<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What to say of this woman, activist, mentor... -If you have it to bring look for this prof. Shell show you how to get there. Run when shes torqued off, otherwise shes pretty cool, very demanding and can help you make it to grad school . If she takes you on and you work it youll be grateful!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2006<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take advantage of the time she devotes to helping you outside of class- her study groups were extra helpful. Sometimes unorganized but she knows her stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Porter helped me enormously --she helped with everything from class material to giving me direction about what to do with my life.  Her teaching has changed my perspective forever--and for the better.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2006<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this is what teaching is about; a love of students, and a love of the subject matter. prof Porter is obviously brilliant, but she's not pretentious or full of self-import. She just started teaching, but everyone in our class loved her teaching style - very easy to follow. She's also genuinely nice- like your favorite math teacher from high school.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2006<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>yikes! showed no interest in the class or success of the class- too absorbed in her own life to care. uninteresting and confusing</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2006<br>Class Name: PSY240<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good intentions, bad presentation.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her for focal point and she was trying to be nice and make the subject cool but most of the time class was just moderately interesting. If you don't care though, neither will she. She's kinda neurotic but makes up for it by expecting nothing more than the minumum from students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2006<br>Class Name: PSY215<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worst teacher ever,her midterm had 3 chapters on it that she never mentioned were on it, tests are all book but she says they are notes and book and she BS's class notes, the class is overall dry and boring. The only good thing is you dont have to attend class, but she is not lenient about anything else. overall worst class ever!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/01/2006<br>Class Name: PSY303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice and helpful, good sense of humor, and really good temperament.  Pay attention in class.  If you are good at taking notes during a lecture/discussion, you'll do fine on all the tests.  Skim over the textbook and study the notes from class and you'll get an A.  Also offers tons of extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2005<br>Class Name: PSY300<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher is witty yet over romantic on the concept of epigenetics. She hates predeterminism and Frued. Good curves on tests, plus she added other EC like reserach participation. Over 300 txt pages to read plus a 250 pg novel. Most questions and essays were on the notes. I don't know if I would take her again, but I would recommend her at least once.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2005<br>Class Name: PSY361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great teacher. I took her for senior capstone, Hist & Systems of Psych it's a very hard class with lots of information, but she does everything she can to make it as easy as possible.  She offers extra credit & may cut you a break and curves like u wouldn't believe!!! Her course load is heavy & difficult but she prepares u for what u need.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: HUMANDEVL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE! I wish this would be the final rating to give her a sad face. She has the worst attitude and loves to put people on the spot. Her tests are hard because she power trips and gives you answers that are all true but SHE wants the MOST TRUE! ugh...hated her teaching. Her class is so boring and she make's sure she goes to the last minute!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: PSY303<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class material. However, she is against all traditional thought, in Psychology and everything else. It is an easy class, but if you are more conservative do not take her because it gets annoying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Totally unstructed class.  Not very bright.  The textbook is not her friend but test are more related to the book more so than her lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2005<br>Class Name: PSY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>seriously, take this pro.! she relates everything to our lives, she is sooo easy to talk to, and she makes class so entertaining! she is by far my favorite pro. here. her tests are fairly difficult but she curves like no other. our class had asked her for a review sheet and it helped us a lot! =)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked this class. She's very interesting and knows alot. She wants to challenge you and make you think. Dont take this instructor if you just want to memorize stuff from a book or dont want to learn. Tests are hard, but you will get an A if you work. Funny smart and hot. I'd take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2005<br>Class Name: PSY303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very funny.

Hard to go to class every day and even harder to stay awake. Very bias approach to teaching.  She teaches psychology but is very focused on animals. Also very hard to study for exams because course is unstructured. Donâ€™t but the book she never agrees with it. coffee required!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2004<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EASY CLASS.
