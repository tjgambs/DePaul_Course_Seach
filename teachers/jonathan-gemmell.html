    I've never been good with math, equations or formulas but this teacher actually made it SO easy to learn and understand. I really enjoyed his class and would take any class taught by him. He was so helpful and genuinely wanted his students to do well. If only all teachers were like Jonathan!

    Mr. Jona is very helpful, funny and easy to understand. He is always there for you during his office hours, email or even calls.  I am currently taking CSC 423 with him and planning to enroll in CSC 424 next quarter as well.  Highly recommend him -especially if you have great sense of humor :) -

    Jonathan is an excellent professor. He makes the class exciting and interesting. You will learn a lot of stuff in his class. Covers the material completely. Doesn't skip anything. He is always willing to answer your questions. I got replies to my questions at midnight too. Gives a lot of work but that is beneficial for you to learn.I learned a lot.

    Very good professor.  Willing to meet outside of regular hours, and is very knowledgeable in the bioinformatic field.  Gives some tough homework, but you will learn a lot.

    He is a GREAT teacher. Very fair, flexible and easy going. Easy grader and provides help if you need it. The three page papers, due once a week, are easy. Often extends the due date for assignments. Play games for a history credit, how cool&#63;

    Highly recommended!  He is one of the few professors at DePaul that actually make you want to attend his lectures.  He explains all the technical stuff in plain English and concentrates on the &quot;big picture&quot; rather than the small stuff.  He is a very nice guy and is willing to help you whenever he can.  Homework, quizzes, and tests are easy.
