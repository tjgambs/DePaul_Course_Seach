He is very obviously invested in avant garde film and is a great teacher for the subject. This class was actually the one that inspired me to change to a DC major. There are a lot of readings and the lectures are long but a lot of the films are very interesting. Make sure to take good notes to study. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2015<br>Class Name: DC233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>I took this class on a whim but it quickly became one of my favorite classes I have taken at DePaul. Professor Roche was always available for office hours and while the class was challenging I feel like I learned so much about avant-garde film. He kows what he's talking about and it shows in his lectures and feedback. Would strongly recommend. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2013<br>Class Name: DCM274<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher!! Made three hour classes fly by. Film is not my cup of tea at all and I really enjoyed this class. His tests can be challanging, but I studied for all by going into depth with my notes and got As on both. Definitely take him if you get the chance!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/24/2013<br>Class Name: DC274<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Heres the skinny. Nice guy, though seems to have too many rules. Tests are pretty hard, so are quizzes. But, make sure you get full credit on ALL labs (rather easy to do). If you get C's on quizzes and tests, but full credit on all labs, you could walk away with a B. Pretty simple. Im an Econ major, and i don't know jack about film. Nice guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: DC233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Roche is AMAZING!! Very knowledgeable in his field and makes it interesting for us too.There is a lot of readings and videos to watch but it is all worth it. I just recommend that you take the class and not the online class. You miss so much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2013<br>Class Name: DC274<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely intelligent man who provides the information very clearly and keeps the class, for the most part, interesting. 1 quiz, 1 midterm, 1 final. Study and you'll be fine. Class is easier for DC majors who know a bit about camera's/lighting already. Don't be late, Don't use your phone in class. Solid Overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2013<br>Class Name: DC274<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Roche is a great instructor. He presents the material in a clear manner and lets you know exactly what to expect on his exams. The tests can be tough, but if you go over the material a few times outside of class you will do just fine. He is very understanding and cut me some slack on absences. Never show up late!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2013<br>Class Name: DC233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Professor Roche. Taking his course really opened me up to experimental forms of cinema. He discusses cinema in the form of ideas and metaphor in a supremely objective and intellectual manner. You can literally talk to him for hours about the philosophy of the new postmodern and anything else related to the avante-garde.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2012<br>Class Name: DC110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Andrew is a very smart man. He is clearly knowledgeable in the field of Cinema and does an exceedingly excellent job in providing a good lecture based on that knowledge. He gives great in-class examples with a variety of wonderful films, and his assignments are simple, but challenging. He is strict, but by no means rude. Also, very fun to talk to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: DC233<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Roche is egotistical and impulsive - the man disrupts his own lectures with tirades about students not following his no laptop policy. He's dull (zero emotion in lectures), disorganized (due dates constantly changed), and condescending (talks down to those who don't see eye-to-eye with him).</div></div></div></body></html>
