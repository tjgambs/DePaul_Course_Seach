He has extensive experience investing in equities and the knowledge you can gain from his life experiences in the past and currently are very informative. Professor Booth offers the type of education on investments that are applicable professionally and individually. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2014<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting lectures, but little direction and guidance when it comes to exams. I studied his slides thoroughly and still struggled with the final (mid term was easier). Two exams and a two page paper make up your grade. No homework or in class practice problems, which leaves you a little lost come test time. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took this professor relying on the feedback from this website, and I am disappointed to say the least. His "real-world" examples are nothing more than tangents. He does not lay out the information clearly in his notes, and his lectures are a far cry from clear. You're left with exams that diverge from the concepts learned. Would pick a diff prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a great professor!If you want to learn about finance, this is the best professor to take. He uses real life examples and explains it in such an intriguing way that you actually enjoy learning. I've used the stuff Booth taught in all my other classes and even at my job! However, tests can throw you off a bit! So make sure you know your stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2014<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes class interesting by talking about his real life finance investments. He assigns no homework and does not use the book. Although attendance is not mandatory make sure you pay attention in class and study from handouts and powerpoints and that should be sufficient to get an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2013<br>Class Name: FIN523<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor makes the reality investment environment very related. You will never get bored in his class because he always shares his investing stories. Downside is he never assigns homework and I am a bit lost when prepare exams. Two examples plus one project is what you have in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/18/2012<br>Class Name: FIN595<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class had a lot of potential, but he didn't teach us anything.  Basically he said, "pick stocks for the portfolio and tell me when to buy and sell."  Luckily I had quite a bit of background, but I feel bad for the people who didnt since he didnt actually teach us anything. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2011<br>Class Name: FIN330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good</div></div></div></body></html>
