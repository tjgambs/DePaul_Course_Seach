    I really liked this professor. The people who don't like her didn't try. You do have to study, but just study the powerpoints and you'll be fine. She always gives out the answers after each quiz and test and gives lots of examples and actually tries to help you learn. Great professor as far as the econ dept. goes. Take her

    Excellent teacher. shee simplifies everything and you actually get it. One of the only classes I truly enjoy going to. The things I learned in this class are actually relevant enough that I will use them beyond this quarter. Really nice teacher, she made exerything really pleasant and enjoyable. I would definitely take him again.Excellent teacher.

    She seems like a nice person, but she is not very helpful and does not seem to care whether her students are doing well. I think her method of teaching economics through power point is not effective, not to mention she just copy's the examples straight from the book.

    Not a good teacher.  Her lectures are boring and the quizzes and tests are not easy.  The powerpoints are right from the book so going to class is pretty much pointless.
