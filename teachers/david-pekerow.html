Keeps you entertained sometimes. Been  moments where I was bored in the class but its good. It's hard, but if you take good notes and pay attention to his teaching, you will be fine. One thing good about is sometimes he gives hints away. If i had to chance to take business ethics again, I would take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2006<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>its definitely one of those classe that makes you think unlike some other classes I have taken at the university he welcomes insights from students and yes the midterm/final was difficult and yes I am also one of those students who thought I was going to fail the midterm/final I ended up with an A just try your best n it will be okay =)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: PHIL256<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>business ethics was interesting...he touches his forehead alot and on the midterm u incorporate an old philosophical theory to new age business case....most everyone did poorly...final was 14 pages~! i am a straight a student but he made this class much more difficult than it needed to be...interesting yet tiring! tests are weighted heavily~~!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2006<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>NOT helpful, never posts on blackboard so you don't ever know your grade, and he's got very unrealistic opinions.

What kind of professor tells a student that &quot;I can't look over your paper because it would be unfair to other students.&quot; A professor is supposed to help students. If those &quot;other students&quot; wanted help they could ask. The take-home final was damn well near impossible.

I am not..so the lectures were a bit boring and long-winded...references to philosophers I don't know. This was bad for me and I am glad it is over. If you like philosophy and it is your major take this class other than that find another teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good teacher. Read, talk, and write and youll pass with flying colors.  quite dorky, sometimes rambles.  material is a little dense and old language.  Listen to him interpret and youll be fine.

IF you're open, Pekerow writes a fabulous curriculum. each work/subject is relavent to the next and the things discussed can easily be applied to your life. i had little interest in philosophy before but was thoroughly impressed and satisfied after taking his course. hes a good teacher if u show interest&respect</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: PHILOSOPHY<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: BUSINESSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked him. He seemed a little hard headed at times but his material was clearly defined and he gave plenty of time to accomplish it. I like the course and the presentations that the groups had to do.

I really enjoy profs who don't speak to you like you're ten, or in that whole &quot;I have a PhD and you're a lowly undergrad&quot; kind of way and Pekerow treats you like the intelligent, self-sufficient, repsonsible human beings you really should be by now.

A lil sarcastic. Participate and he'll know your name. Sufficient readings per week. Not too much homework. A midterm, a group project, and a final paper.
