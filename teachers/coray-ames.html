She enjoys what she does and brings a lot of enthusiasm to each lesson.  But a lot of her classes are very boring and take hours to cover 30 minutes worth of material.  Attendance is mandatory.  Don't take for an easy class, but I highly reccommend her if you're not going to slack off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ames is willing to help you out whenever you need it. Shes very nice and is always smiling. We had readings due every class (just for discussions but I didn't read 1/4 of the assignments and pulled off a B+). The writing assignments aren't bad and she gives you plenty of time (I got a week extension on one paper). I highly recommend her.</div></div></div></body></html>
