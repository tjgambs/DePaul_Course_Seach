Always late to class (like 30 minutes late) but expected you to stay. Not very helpful. Lectures were long and boring. Never clear on what you were supposed to be doing in class or for homework. NEVER returns e-mails. It would have been a better class if the professor would have been different.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2009<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not helpful at all. everytime you ask a question he basically tells you that you should know the answer to it because of his tutorials. He is not horrible, but if you really need help with computers, he is not the professor to take. If you already know html and can catch up on labs and hw easily, you'll be fine. If you ask questions, good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2009<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's very passive aggressive but also very forgiving. All of his lectures are online which helped a lot. Assignments are easy but time consuming. As long as he sees you're making an effort, he'll give you a good grade. Very lenient.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Larrain is a bit of a spaz, and he can be confusing as hell sometimes, but overall, he's not horrible. The class was incredibly easy though, and I'm not entirely sure we covered everything we were supposed to, as I'm now taking IT230, and there seems like there might be a few bits I have some catching up to do on...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2008<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easiest professor you will ever take. Attendance is not mandatory, so if you already know HTML I would take this class to fill a scientific requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2008<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you do the work, attend class, and ask him questions who should walk out with an A. He has a odd/eccentric personality which includes speaking loudly, pacing, and leaving the room abruptly. He is/was in a band and really into music (I think he played the guitar.) You also learn very helpful information about websites, html, css, and images.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you need to fill your Scientific Quantitative requirement- he is the guy. Makes what could be annoyingly complicated work very easy to understand. He is flexible and walks you through everything.  In the end you get to learn how do design your own website- itâ€™s a cool class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2007<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Larrain makes me winded just by watching him teach!  He is quite animated when he lectures, but I really liked his class and the assignments were very straight forward.  Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2007<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor! Highly recommended...easy class to fulfil your science requirement.  He tells you exactly what you have to do and always lets you out early. Easy A ...Take him!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2007<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Larrain is great!!! All the reviews on him on this page are true. I am thankful for having him as a instructor. I never knew the techniques of HTML until this class. Would recommend this instructor to everyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2007<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy. He is easy-going and incredibly willing to help you out either in class or via email. All of his labs and take-home assignments were easy, though some of them were time-consuming. The material is not that difficult and required little to no outside reading. His notes are readily available online and easy to understand. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definitely take him!   He is clear and concise and very helpful.  He is also really nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/12/2006<br>Class Name: CSC224<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Larraine was my first teacher at Depaul. He's an excellent teacher. I'd take another class with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2005<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy way to learn web design, attendance is not mandatory, all notes are posted on-line with h.w., very concise so all you have to do is follow directions. Plus, you don't need to buy a book. I'd take it again...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2005<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed his class because he knows his stuff and can explain it, not just requritate a book. He is a better instructor then many in his department with PhDs.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: CSC224<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What started off as a seemingly nice lecture turned out to be incredibly boring. Not to take anything away from Larrain, programming is a boring subject. But add a dull environment and regular homework and you've got a class that I would avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2004<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher! Many people find programming hard so they will automatically blame it on the teacher. I'm graduating in a few weeks and have had many CS professors. Prof. Larrain was by far one of the best. He is a great teacher, funny, and entertaining.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2004<br>Class Name: CSC224<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2004<br>Class Name: CSC212<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>can't believe he's still teaching</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2004<br>Class Name: CSC224<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG! Paces from whiteboard to whiteboard for 3 hours a night, like a caged lion. Occasionally responds with attitude like 'If you have to ask THAT question, why are you in MY class&#63;'. A bit too much ego for me.</div></div></div></body></html>
