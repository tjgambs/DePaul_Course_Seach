You had to work as a team, but he penalized those who didnt pull their own weight. He never played favorites everyone was treated equally in the class & that's what made it easy to get through.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2004<br>Class Name: MAT242<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Guy, VERY easy and very cool!
