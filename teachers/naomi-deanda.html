Awesome, fun class with lots of group work and discussions. Much reading and writing but many extra credit options. easy A. attendance not mandatory and several days no class to give time for writing. Would take it again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2011<br>Class Name: LSP501<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY, TIME, AND EFFORT!!! This professor's class is a joke. It is unorganized and boring. The best thing about the class are the novels we read. Discussions are WACK! Her jokes are WACK! I learned absolutely nothing! The course has so much potential but it never reaches it, mainly because of its leardership! NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2010<br>Class Name: LSP250<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a horrible professor who makes you talk &quot;in groups&quot; about all the ideas in the readings, I didn't learn a single thing from the class so far and that's what college is for...right&#63;  AVOID HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2009<br>Class Name: REL113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its an easy class if you do the work. The readings are simple and the quizzes on them are easy. Attendance not required, always a good deal of extra credit involved in the class. Good way to get rid of the religious traditions requirement. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2009<br>Class Name: LATINREL<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class...kinda boring..not too much work tho..she's kinda awkward and not too confident as a teacher..but a goodway to get a religion req out of the way..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2008<br>Class Name: REL232<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very nice professor, but extremely inconsistent with her schedule. she missed 4 classes, waste of money and time!! The books you really dont need so dont waste your money!! You can get through the course with out them. The class was easy, but completely useless. AND KEEP TRACK OF YOUR POINTS IN THE CLASS!! shes very bad with managing grades</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2008<br>Class Name: LST291<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is somewhat a joke with you creating your own grade, which is pretty tricky. Reasonable. She is pretty boring at times but has a good sense of humor and means well. She loves Catholicism as a study and wants to spread it on to her students. No midterm, quizzes, final just a presentation or paper with lots of busy work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2006<br>Class Name: REL291<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice woman, really smart about Latin American Religion, etc.  Only bad thing is that she's disorganized and her class expectations are unclear.  She loses assignments often.  Again, nice woman but not the best professor.  She's super easy but the class is a headache and I wouldn't take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2006<br>Class Name: REL113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Professor, not to difficult, interesting subjects, lot of work buts its easy, few papers,and quizzes, grading system is pretty cool, you pretty much pick what you want to do.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2006<br>Class Name: REL113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor!

If you don't though, you will still get away with just doing your work. Would recommend her to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2006<br>Class Name: REL113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class. Cool grading system (you basically decide which assignments you want to complete). Very sweet and helpful.  Passionate about the subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2006<br>Class Name: REL113<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a fun teacher, helpful and interested in her subject. The class isn't super hard and the grading is kind of weird ( you pick your own grade points system) but overall she's a good teacher and tries to make the class fun.</div></div></div></body></html>
