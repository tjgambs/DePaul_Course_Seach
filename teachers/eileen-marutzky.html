Tests are extremely specific and very very difficult, but she does curve. Only 2 tests make up the grade. Online lectures don't cover what is tested most of the time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2014<br>Class Name: ACC370<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Haven't finished the class yet but i know its new and this is the first time its being given at depaul. with that being said, take her! not only is she absolutely hilarious, she is very experienced in the field. 50 chapters in ten weeks is a little intense but she's very helpful and goes over problems. im expecting an A in the class.

I normally wouldn't mind that except that she hates being taken off track and sometimes sneaks her way out of answering your questions. Often confused, I had to read the book to teach myself the topics.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS BY FAR THE BEST TEACHER HERE IN DEPAUL.

You will never feel bored to take Professor Marutzky's class. However, professor always has her excuses to leave the class one hour earlier. We really hope to listen to her class more because the Business Law is not an easy topic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/04/2009<br>Class Name: ACT102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mid-terms (and supposedly finals) are based upon in-class quizzes which are easy.
