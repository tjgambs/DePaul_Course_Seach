He gives little to no guidance on the papers and expects you to know what he is expecting.  Tough, slow grader and doesn't explain curve.  He will help you if you go see him, even gives out his cell #.  I spent at least 10 hours every week working on this class.  Heavy in stats (regressions galore).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Brewer taught me more during 5 weeks than 2 other FIN classes.He is extremely passionate and has VERY difficult exams, (which are curved). If you want to coast with an easy grade dont take Brewer. If you want to get your moneys worth take him, its up to you. Homework is optional, class attendance is mandatory and paper is like 15-20 pages!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, so everyone says how he is so bad. He is not all that bad. If you can, take him in the summer, it seems easier. At the beginning I hated him because his quizzes and tests were VERY difficult...there's a research paper that ended up being 25 pages! very hard but i ended up getting a B, he's helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2010<br>Class Name: FIN323<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unbelievable listen to earlier comments. No directions, 4 grad level case studies given to us in the last 2 weeks of class.  Did not explain what he wants we-the students- taught ourselves He works for the FRB who cares I can work for congress.. then whose the real boss. MIT please he should of stayed there, talks down to students, rude pompous</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart. Great economist.  HORRIBLE TEACHER! 4 papers and 3 tests outside the scope of an undergraduate finance course.  Poorly communicates what he expects in order to succeed than arrogantly talks down to you like your an idiot.  Do yourself a favor and take another Fin 320 teacher unless you want to spend the whole quarter dedicated to him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2010<br>Class Name: FIN513<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Top 3 Best Finance Professors at Kellstadt.  This professor is not fit to teach undergraduate level due to the complexity of his teaching.  You must have a certain knowledge about Banking & Interest Rates before entering this course to really enjoy it.  For those that complain, you should not work in Finance or Economics.  Extremely Intelligent</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2010<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>4 boring/difficult 10 page papers, 3 exams, class participation, attendance, hell.

He might not be very outgoing and stuff but we want to get education not to have a buddy from MBA who can give us easy grade without learning anything.  Anyway, take his class if u want to learn finance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2008<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to write four 5-10 page papers, have a difficult midterm and final then Brewer is the teacher for you. He thinks he knows it all. Save yourself hours and hours of work. Do not take this prof!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2008<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take him. You can work for nine hours on a paper. Send it to him, incorporate all of his corrections and still get a D+. This guy has the biggest ego and and is a terrible teacher. Spare yourself from the hours of work you'll have to do to receive an average grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is a difficult class, a good amount of reading and writing, but he is always willing to help, so take advantage of it.  Finish your papers a few days early and send them to him for review, it will improve your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2007<br>Class Name: FIN512<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I met at Depaul! I learned a lot. Very conscientious and patient. He would like to help you in person many hours off the class. That's rare for professors at DePaul. The lecture is tough but useful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/30/2006<br>Class Name: FIN555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Brewer's class wasn't hard but somewhat monotonous.  Allows the use of formula sheet on exams, overall not a difficult professor.  Open to suggestions and willing to reexamine situations.  One case to work on that seems hard but he's very flexible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2006<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>mr. brewer does not deserve his title as a professor, nor should he be given this respect by the students, until he shows the slightest respect towards the students. This mr brewer is garbage as a teacher, notes upon notes of useless information, precious time wasted talking about completely immaterial information. Avoid this mr brewer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2006<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2006<br>Class Name: FINAN340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard class.

He does help students before and after class with any questions they may have. A lot of reading and study, but you will leave his class with a sense of understanding and accomplishment not offered by other Finance professors. A SOLID professor to have studied with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows the subject well but does not have teaching skills. Class is overloaded with readings and content and presentations are boring and unclear. He did not share the grading of the course and most students were dissatisfied with the grades. Best to avoid if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2005<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A lot of work (don't expect an easy A). A literal TON of reading, but the application of coursework is based on his in-class handouts. Attend class, study hard, read everything, and you'll score fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class.

Gives a lot to do, not communicating what exactly he wants. I would say his ego is bigger than ability to teach. It is not an easy class, book is ok, his notes terrible. He  feels he is the smart one, us below him. A good teacher teaches, he does n</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's tough, but if you can tolerate learning somthing and reading a lot (and perhaps a slight blemish to your GPA) then take him. I'm applying his 320 material in my ECO305 & 306 classes, and i'll tell you right now i'm smoking the rest of my class mates. Brewer's great, take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2005<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher.  Explains all the material very clearly and dont push students out of their minds to get an A in his class.  Make you you do an extra credit well which is worth 10% of your grade.  Don't bother buying the book, because all his tests and quizes are from the materials he gives.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2005<br>Class Name: FIN225<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is such an a pain in the ***. Gives a lot of readings. He is unclear and expects you to know the material from head to toe, as if we had no other classes but just his. Please do not take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What kind of an idiot teaches a class, that does not require any prerequisites, at a graduate level&#63; This guy does. He makes you look up tons of useless info and report it back to him. Unlike the teacher, the book is very clear, but not much of help. Handouts are waaay over students' heads.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2004<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2004<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take his class, he doesn’t think anyone has a life or a job. He expects you to drop everything for his class. Plus, the man’s ego is out of control. He is a researcher,that’s it! He’s NOT Greenspan! He can’t even spell or write a complete sentence.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2004<br>Class Name: FIN340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors ever.
