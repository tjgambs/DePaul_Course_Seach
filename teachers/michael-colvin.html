Exams are very difficult. The average for each exam was around 60% (though he does curve generously). Will sometimes make fun of students for asking sincere questions. He skipped a lot of material in the book that we were supposed to cover. Avoid him if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher, avoid class with Colvin at all costs. He does not cover the material in the book that is required for MAT 141 and he goes off on tangents all the time that has no relation to the actual material. When you ask questions he makes you look dumb in front of the class and makes fun of you, and then never actually answers the question</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: MAT140<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice, funny, smart, and tries pretty hard in his lectures to help you understand. BUT, he is disorganized and sometimes can't remember what sections he covered and those he didn't, which makes it hard to study for tests. Hand writing is hard to read on chalkboard. Does not return homework. Slow grader of exams. I taught myself, basically.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: MAT141<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Never responds to e-mails, talks about himself for 50% of the class instead of teaching. If you want to learn then don't take this class. Average grade for every exam was 60%, plan on teaching yourself. I wouldn't have passed if it weren't for the curve. Skipped around the textbook so frequently,  don't even try using it while in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2014<br>Class Name: 140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst math teacher ever. Not very clear at all, you have to teach yourself. Class material is not very organized and gets himself confused in class. Highly advisable to find another instructor if you can. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class</div></div></div></body></html>
