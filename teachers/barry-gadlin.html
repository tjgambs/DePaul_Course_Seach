Also, how does an accredited university get away with making grad students color with crayons not just once but 3 times in this course&#63;  I feel bad for saying this for Gadlin is nice, but I'm going into debt for this!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2004<br>Class Name: SEC325<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>it's pretty much like taking a grade school class. all he does is assign journal entries and projects that are SO elementary, but then he grades them with reckless abandon. not sure i'd recommend him, but he is a nice guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: SEC325<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE CLASS WAS REALLY BORING.  HE IS A NICE GUY BUT VERY UNCLEAR AT TIMES.  A LOT OF BUSY WORK.  AND HIS GRADING SCALE IS VERY STRANGE.</div></div></div></body></html>
