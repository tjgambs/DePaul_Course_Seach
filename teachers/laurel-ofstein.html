I wish she utilized readings more and offered more readings. However, she cultured a unique learning environment and offered many useful learning tools that few people would offer to MBA students. I felt her examples to be insightful. I highly recommend her and this course. It is also an Easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2011<br>Class Name: MGT573<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Laural is a nice person but not exactly what I expect out of a professor in the MBA program.  Her class is heavily based on participation and a few papers which she has no issue giving out perfect scores on.  Take this class for the easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: MGT572<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this class! Laurel is nice, however she is an extremely difficult grader for material that's relatively subjective. You have no clue of how well you're doing until the after of the semester because 50% of your grade is a 10 page paper. She's very strict about attendance - no coming in late or leaving early. Class was pretty useless.</div></div></div></body></html>
