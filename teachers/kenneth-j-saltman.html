Changed my entire thought process about equity and education. If you don't like a challenge, don't take this course. Give him a chance-- he may not be the most engaging teacher, but he is spot on with his critiques of Edu & society. Don't hate just because you don't understand the material. Ask q's!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2013<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very smart man, but he is not a good teacher! You have a TON of readings per week and some of the readings are interesting and pertain to education, but others are so hard to comprehend and leaves you wondering how it has to do with teaching.  You have reading quizzes each week and a final paper.  He is not engaging with students, avoid him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/13/2013<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard class.

I took it as an elective in my doctoral program, and it was absolutely the worst class in my academic career. All  he  does is promote his socialist ideology, which can be very offensive. You will get a lower grade unless you agree with him. DePaul should pay attention to the students' reviews.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2011<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A tough, tough, tough teacher. He is extremely knowledgeable but I'm not sure he should be teaching this class to undergrads. The course, readings, and discussion were all super hard to follow. If you're doing education, take this course later in your career. Too hard for freshmen and sophomores to comprehend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2011<br>Class Name: EDU408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.  He makes time to meet with his students and he is very helpful.  The readings are little complicated, but he goes over the readings with the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2009<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting class, and super knowledgeable guy.  All you have to do is actually the read the books and show up to class and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2009<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i dropped it because the fact that it is a requirement makes this course a pain but after having to sit in his lectures for 3 hours...No way. if youre ready to read and decipher the text by yourself then this is your class. i saw the other comments and wanted a challenge but this class killed me because of the dullness and uselessness of it.beware.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/18/2009<br>Class Name: SCG409<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof.  Anyone who hated him wants to be spon fed fact about school, Saltman actually made them think and they hated that.  The class is CLEARLY about exposing the larger issues attacking education, and again, people just don't want to see the truth.  Ignorance is bliss kind of thing.  Those who speak the truth are often hated the most.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/16/2009<br>Class Name: SCG409<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof is really confusing and acts way above your intelligence level, but I still participated as much as possible, and he totally screwed me over with a final grade. You have no idea what you're getting in the class until it's too late. He gives no feedback throughout. I would not recommend this class to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great course, great prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2008<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Intelligent, but clearly uninterested in the fundamentals of this course. Very little practical, or even theoretical, relevance to education.  Some of the articles/books we had to read were such a stretch, he couldn't even explain the link.  We did get out early every class.  DePaul needs to change the course description to pointless waste.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Saltman is a really smart guy, but honestly his class is really boring. You are required to reading excerpts from books that he wants you to &quot;suffer&quot; through. There was very little class discussion, it pretty much was him talking. The mid-term and final are really tedious. He lets you out early everytime 4 a nite class. Meh!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do NOT take this professor unless you enjoy reading ridiculously boring books by FRENCH sociologists and you enjoy doing head slams for three hours during a night class.  Saltman is admittedly socially inappropriate and makes students feel as if their answers are incorrect.  Painful class!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2007<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the best education course I have taken.  It got me thinking about teaching practice and broader implications of schooling.

The material was interesting but the presentation was not.  No relevance to teaching.  He gave no feedback/rubric on assignments.

The class made me think about education and society and while I didnt agree with a lot of what he said, he told me he respected that which I liked.  It didnt have a lot to do with middle school though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was the worst.  I have never taken a class in which I learned less; no relevance to anything to do with education.

The class became a platform for him to express his views on economic, political, and social inequalities UNRELATED to education.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2005<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was enlightening and Dr. Saltman is quite knowledgable.  He does, however, like to hear himself talk.  He's also a prolific author, so I have a great deal of respect for him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2005<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>THE CLASS IS SO BORING, THERE IS TOO MANY READING TO KEEP UP WITH WORK. CLASS IS VERY INTERESTING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MILITARISM. I LEARN THINGS I NEVER WOULD LEARN IN A REGULAR HISTORY CLASS.

Required reading for this course had to be bought from one non-DePaul bookstore, which was MAJORLY annoying (and expensive - way not to be capitalistic!) Reading seemed unrelevant to class discussion which seemed unrelevent to course objectives. He's pleasant and smart, though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2005<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring class, but easy....however it drags and there is a 15 page term paper in the end..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2005<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor!

As far as many of the comments on this page are concerned I am not surprised. The education students that I have encountered at DePaul are extremely depressing...I hope most of them go into a different field becaus</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: LSE380<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was super boring... he made you do these weekly papers and made us read so many pointless books then made individual people present in front of the entire class.
