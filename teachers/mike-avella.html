He loves to share his stories with the class of his past experiences in the industry which made the long class period fly by.  We take a couple class field trips to restaurants and hotels  as well! Would definitely recommend taking Mike any chance you get!

The way he lectures is very clear, and simple. Only few professors have the ability to deliver the ideas to the students very easily, and Mike is one of them. If you got a chance to take a class with him definitely take it. He is very helpful, and you learn something new in every class you attend !</div></div></div></body></html>
