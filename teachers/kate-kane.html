Literally had several papers marked down because she thought I was wrong (yeah, ok). Reading intensive and discussion intensive but really interesting class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2013<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pointless class. But what do I expect, it's about Twilight. Dumb class where the same ideas get talked about every class. She makes the class harder than it has to be and is very opinion biased when grading your paper, so agree with everything she says. Too much work for a stupid focal point.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2012<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>There is a lot of reading involved and you are required to print out the readings regardless of length. She expects a lot of participation. She brings up a lot of interesting views of the material and overall, is interesting to listen to (which is good because she rambles a bit). I enjoyed her class but I can see where people might not.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2011<br>Class Name: WGS388<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She gives difficult readings like students have no other work to do at all. If you dont agree with her she thinks you're wrong, plain and simple. Takes off point if you dont print her 45 page readings, or speak at all. She is a fair grader and is really passionate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2011<br>Class Name: WGS388<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you do not like to read huge ammounts of pages don't take her. She assigns readings like its no tomorrow. Also if you don't read them she will deduct points and sometimes tells you to leave. It is a 300 level course so its understandable. This should not be your first WGS class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2011<br>Class Name: LGBTRAN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is just horrendous. She gives out way too many readings. She won't remind you of anything due. Her homework is not clear at all, and if you email her about it she won't even specify. I dropped her class immediately, and on the last day i could too! Get out quick or don't take her at all, she's just not worth the frustration.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2011<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The writing assignments given by this teacher were way too complicated and there was too much reading given out. our homework would be between 3-5 hours of reading with sometimes only a day after to get it completed.If you take this teacher and do the assignments youll end up spending more time on this class than any other classes as a sophomore.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kane does not just teach but she opens up minds to issues in the world.  To those who complain that she only wants her view to be supported, I would say she is just trying to challenge your viewpoint.  I would argue that your viewpoint runs with the mainstream and she would like the use of more critical thinking than naive understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2011<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Her grading is completely ridiculous for a 100-level course.  Just like the other comments states, if it is not her point of view, it is WRONG. She expects so much from students, which is not a bad thing, but students cannot expect anything from her.  She is often late, rude, AND to top things off she lost my class' grading sheet, too irresponsibe</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2011<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took WGS 100 as a liberal studies requirement, and I LOVED it! I'm thinking about minoring in women studies thanks to this class. Her sense of humor is awesome and the way she talks caught my attention. She likes participation, so participate! Even if you're wrong, you'll still receive credit for speaking up.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was very excited to take a class on TWILIGHT. She just ruined everything for me. She doesn't care what you have to say. She constantly tells people who do speak up and try and initiate some kind of conversation to stop. She thinks her views are the only right views. horrible just horrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She never sees the other view point, always argues with students in class and this class is a Focal Point about Twilight. I mean, come on, a class on TWILIGHT shouldn't be this difficult to participate in, but when the professor disagrees with you every time you speak up, it makes it a little hard to feel like your opinion is valued.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2011<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not an easy or fair grader. She she is not very accepting of opions that do not allign with hers or th theories she believes in. Its tolerable but Im sure thier are better profs. to take esp if ur not really interested in radical feminism.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2011<br>Class Name: WRD101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are interested in womens and gender studies, taking a class by Kate Kane is a must. She is incredible and her class was one of the best classes I've ever taken</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2010<br>Class Name: WGS100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Go to class prepared.  Have your texts and some comments to make on them, or else your grade will be dropping down a cliff.  Every day you don't participate, she deducts points.  She's pretty cool and open minded, but she'll love you more if you agree with her POV.  Super nice if you're nice to her.  Sometimes instructions were a little unclear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/30/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She takes the class way too seriously, Sophomore seminars are supposed to be a light workload and relaxed learning experience, but she absolutely does not treat it as such.  The way she assigns constant readings and assignments makes her uncool, DONT TAKE HER unless you TRULY care about the subject material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was incredibly boring.  She is a hardcore feminist and doesn't really see any view point but her own.  Too much reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2009<br>Class Name: WMS394<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kane is an okay teacher, make sure you participate and you should do fine. Remember she deducts points every class you don't say anything so make sure to blabber out something. Semi-hard grader but if you like women's studies you should do fine. I wouldn't recommend though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT. DO NOT. DO NOT TAKE HER!!!!!! if u work ur butt off on her papers, she will STILL not give you a good grade! and if u take the class, dont bother to do any of the re-writes...she will  not give u a better grade for them, its a waste of time!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2009<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated this class! she is honestly not a good teacher, she grades unfairly and is very strict with the papers.. If she doesnt like you, you will never get an A. NOT recommended, take someone else; its not an easy class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2008<br>Class Name: WMS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kate Kane is an excellent professor and will challenge the way you view the world.  Today I uphold strong ethical values that she influenced during our one-on-one time.  She always teaches interesting courses, i.e. Women's Studies/LGBTQ Studies.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/07/2008<br>Class Name: WMS100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kate was very helpful when i asked for advice on my paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2007<br>Class Name: WNS290<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hated the class. She is an alright teacher but sometimes she just talks and talks and talks.  And if you are in her class, even if its a night class, expect to stay the WHOLE time.  She's nice, I liked her, if I had had more interest in the class maybe I would have nicer things to say.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2007<br>Class Name: WMS100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>all you need to really do is read the articles and books.

She's kind of scatterbrained. Daily readings out of the reader she put together. You can go to class without reading easily. A few 4 page essays and a take home final. She's a pretty easy grader being that I got generous grades for not so generous work. I wouldn't take any of her classes again though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I got really good grades on everything, but then she surprised me with a grade lower than I had expected..

I'd taker her again. She sparks discussion & is open. I never experienced her bringing any &quot;inappropriate&quot; personal stuff into the classroom. Whoever said that is probably just homophobic.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: WMS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Kane needs to learn to keep an open mind.
