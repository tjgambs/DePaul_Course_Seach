The course is not overly difficult and he provides a comprehensive study guide when needed. He provided an extremely strong basis for understanding and defining key sociological terms and perspectives. I recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/18/2012<br>Class Name: SOC353<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He may seem boring and but he is genuinely nice and is very involved in sociology. He's written a lot himself, has many relevant readings online, and truly works and engages with his students to help them out. It is important to stay focused during class because his tests and papers are graded based on what's discussed in class. I recommend him.</div></div></div></body></html>
