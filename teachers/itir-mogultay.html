I never understood math more than when I took her course. I was actually interested and always received such high scores on her quizzes.I messed up on the final and e-mailed her afterwards and told her I was struggling and she helped make sure my grade was a passing grade. She will also extend any work you need an extension on. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>She is amazing. She does so many problems during class, offers extensions, drops lowest grades for hw and quizzes. In class quizzes were two questions. The homework has step by step help and you can do each problem multiple times.. On one midterm, I got a 98% and I didn't really study, just did the pre-midterm quizzes online. TAKE HER!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2014<br>Class Name: MTH151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mogultay is an amazing teacher. For those who don't like math, TAKE HER! She makes the most complicated topics a breeze to learn and as long as you attend class you will do fine. She is extremely fair and her texts are not unnecessarily hard. Only downfalls: Two midterms and no calculators. But she made this class very interesting!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was such a great professor that I took her for 150, 151, and 152. I honestly would not have passed the courses if it weren't for her. She is an amazing professor who is very detailed in her lectures. If you show up to class and take all of the notes it's hard not to pass. Most exam questions are found in her examples in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2014<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She passes grading on to her TA's who are pretty easy, but you can tell she enjoys what she teaches and that makes her class worth wile.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2014<br>Class Name: MAT156<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's really nice and helpful. Tests were very straight forward.

She gives you review sheets for each one and if you know that you're fine. Gives a lot of notes but sometimes neglects the hardest things so you have to teach yourself a little. Not bad though, would recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2013<br>Class Name: MAT152<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Mogultay is very, very good about giving lecture, she explains everything clearly and with order. Though math could be hard especially in calculus 3 but she is very helpful if you talk to her during office hour. She is such a nice prof that willling to answer as many questions as you have, really nice, take her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Honestly, you would have to try to fail her class. She's very clear and the exams are very fair and don't test on anything you haven't seen before. She study guides she makes are very representative of what will be on the exam.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2013<br>Class Name: MATH148<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best. She made math a whole new experience for me. Her office hours helped me greatly and if I had my way I'll take her for all my Math courses.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor. Wants her students to do well. Explains it nice and clearly. The solutions she posts to the homework facilitate learning of the material. She also posts study guides before the midterms (yes there are two) and the final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2013<br>Class Name: MATH148<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor! By far the best math professor I have taken or interacted with at IIT. She is extremely dedicated and committed to ensuring that her students understand the material. I wish she was staying at IIT to take her as a professor again but best of luck at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2013<br>Class Name: MATH148<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ms. Mogultay Is extremely helpful, nice and smart. She is never in a hurry and take out time to help those who are lagging. Her office hours are a opens you to the kind of person she is and how much she wants you to do well... If you  have her you'll like Math.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very Good Teacher.  Hands down, best math professor at the university.  I actually want to go to every single class and I learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First off I wills tart by saying that the homeowrk is difficult. Howeever, the quizzes are a lot easier and she posts detailed solutions to every question on the homework to help you prepare for the midterms and final. If you show up to class and try to do the homework you should be fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you're bad at math to begin with, don't take this professor. She insists on using "traditional methods" of teaching, meaning she dumps mymathlab and lectures all class, in which she tells you to take notes on everything. At the end of the day, you write up an entire textbook, and then she gives you homework that is totally irrelevant. HARD!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2013<br>Class Name: MAT148<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent teacher and great person.  Go to class, do all the HW and you will definitely do well on her class.  Attending the classes is a big help for this class.  One of the best classes I have taken is this one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2013<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mogultay is one of the best professors I have ever seen.  She teaches very well and  clearly.  All class material is fair.  She really takes her time to help in class and during office hours.  I strongly recommend her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2012<br>Class Name: MATH151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Itir is a fantastic professor! She is so clear, and she is really concerned with her students doing well. She's spunky, and she keeps your attention with interesting examples. It's calculus, so of course it's difficult. But she definitely makes it manageable! I'm taking the next course with her next quarter! She rocks!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2011<br>Class Name: DIFF1<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the coolest person i have ever met,  she teaches amazing and just listening is enough to understand :) love from yeditepe university my coolest prof. ever :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2010<br>Class Name: MAT151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mogultay is very professional and awesome! She certainly knows her Math and knows it well. You'llfine in her class as long as you do your homework and study. She has a bit of an accent, but it wasn't any trouble for me to understand her.
