    I was told this wa sher first quarter teaching this course.  It feels like she could have guided the students better with the work they are doing for their clients.  It gave us leeway on the procedure, however, it could have been more clear.  Also!  The journals after every class I felt was useless.

    She doesn't do a good job of giving examples or telling her expectations of assignments from the students, causing poor grades.  Usually she is moderately flexible with the due dates or will allow revisions before the end of class.  She also for some reason seems to get a bit frustrated or angry if you don't understand what she is telling you.

    Class is pretty much self study, no video recordings. Weekly assignments, weekly powerpoints with key points highlighted, weekly quizzes. Final Project to develop your personalized leadership plan. Useful class but Prof is a little lazy and doesn't respond to q's on the forums. Easy grader though. But assignments aren't graded for weeks.

    Professor Steinbach is super organized and helpful. She has excellent command of the material and ran a very good class. Although I wasn't super interested in the material prior to the class, I got a lot out of it.

    Terry is an excellent professor. She has a lot of professional experience, and provides a ton of support for her students. Our work made an actual real world impact, and she pushed us to provide the quality expected of DePaul students. I would take a class with her any time.

    So I took this professors online class and I warn you- DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS ONLINE. She's really disorganized, offers little help when it comes to big assignments, &amp; never gets your grades up. Im sure I would've had a better experience if I was in a classroom, but I had to teach myself the whole quarter &amp; Java Script is not easy to understand

    Incredibly experienced and knowledgeable! She always has a lot of interesting and current information to discuss in the class, and the grading is pretty easy. She also is willing to help any CDM student at any time with advising issues, even helped clear up a problem my own adviser didn't know how to fix! Great professor

    Great teacher.  Very straight-forward.  Extends assignment due dates.  If you turn in all of your work, you will pass this class.  She is extremely helpful and a very knowledgeable SME in her field.

    Prof. Steinbach is really nice. Her lectures are interesting and homework is easy. There is a quiz every week but they cover stuff from the lectures and the readings... not a big deal. Take this class! No final exam, just a final paper. She's great! I highly recommend her!

    I have had her 3 times now IT215, IT130 and a ECT class.  Both ECT and IT very easy.  IT215 very tuff make sure you attend class so you do not get lost.  She is a very good teacher and would take her again if she offers any class I need.

    Very easy teacher. She lets students turn work in late without penalty explains assignments clearly and is a fair grader. If you need help she'll help you out. Additionally, I'm a guy, and i definately dont feel like she favored the girls more. I think she tries to be fair with everybody or maybe she just liked me and my two other guy friends. Ther

    I had no problems with this teacher at all.  I never recieved an unfair grade, everything WAS explained in class if you were attentive.  The class was ridiculously easy.  She also provided multiple examples for the same concepts.  The pacing was perfect.  If you didn't do well in this class, then you probably aren't meant for CTI.

    Good teacher overall.  Has good knowledge of the subject.  Relies on Power Point alot.  Like others have said, if the class whines she becomes very lenient.  Would take again.

    good teacher.  all she uses is powerpoint - all the time.  if your class is sad enough, she'll start being incredibly lenient - on everything.  i got an A, im sure you can.  if youre patient, take her.  no guarantees.

    She really makes the class horrible. It could not be more boring. Going to class seems really unnecessary. Basically if you took CSC 319, going to IS 315 with this professor is useless.
