If you like to be active def take her, but if you are not then she's not the teacher for you. She doesn't want you standing around talking with your friends. You need to do what you are supposed to. Even if you can't, the fact that you are trying is something she really appreciates. She is very supportive & would def take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: PE151<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Kristen has a hard outer shell but is nice and friendly on the inside! I took her gymnastics class as a non pe-major and learned alot. As long as you are interested and leave your attitude at the door, you will have fun! Sometimes it was tough wanting to work out every day, and she also made you participate 100%. Take if you like the sport</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2013<br>Class Name: PE302<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pretty good teacher Loud for everyone to hear, pretty chill class setting, If you show up and pay attention you will get an A. Not to mention she's smoking HOTT.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2012<br>Class Name: PEE273<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely unorganized teacher. Did not stick to the syllabus. Doesn't even have 4 or 5 classes, so the class felt more like an online class than a real one; yet attendance was mandatory for us? Midterm and Final were very hard. Overall, you will feel dazed and confused throughout the course. Better off buying the textbook and teaching yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2011<br>Class Name: PE206<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She made us buy the book in the beginning of class. However, I read the first 2 chpts and stopped. No use of the book. There s a midterm and a final along with a project. Overall, I liked her, she knew a lot and the clas was an easy A. I would def. take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2011<br>Class Name: PE302<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You literally have to show up to class to get an A. She is a very nice lady who grades pretty easy. As long as you show up to every class and know how to do CPR by the end of the quarter you'll get an A. Plus, the class is only 6 weeks long...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2010<br>Class Name: PE390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an amazing teacher!! She is always willing to help you outside of class and respondes to emails, which is rare for teachers. You can tell that the people who complain about her are the ones who don't try or don't read. If you read and are active in class you will easily be able to understand what she says.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2009<br>Class Name: PE302<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She doesn't know the content very well, most of the students correct her.  The book is cheap but useless.  The class is a breeze, take notes from the videos and you'll have all you need to get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2007<br>Class Name: PE273<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>comes off strong, but do your work and your fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2006<br>Class Name: PE390<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not very clear and likes to put students down- but other than that the class is fairly easy. Makes classes interesting and gives decent hw assignments. Quizes are tricky and require a bit of studying. Just stay on her good side.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/15/2006<br>Class Name: PE273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kristen may come off as a hard ass but if you get your work done and show up to class, you have nothing to wory about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2006<br>Class Name: FITNESS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is 100% attendance, just don't miss more than three days and you get an A.

She's really helpful if you go talk to her one on one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: PE273<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A quotes that come to mind when I read the critiques of this professor.  &quot;I have discovered that all human evil comes from this, man's being unable to sit still in a room.&quot; Don't listen to these people. If you actually read, listen & do your assignments, ur golden. And for once, this teacher actually practices what she preaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: PE273<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Learned a lot about nutrition that will be very useful when I start teaching and with everyday life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2006<br>Class Name: BASKETBALL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LMAO to the comment below. I love honesty! Last year after her giving several !B's & C's! in bball class b/c of her impossible exam, she decides to make this year's exam way too easy. That is inexperience right there. She really has no idea what she is doing. She just doesn't understand how to teach. She is the devil! Are we being too harsh&#63;...nah!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: PE<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OR...ever since Jordan Hamson left and Kristen took over, depression rate among PE majors have increased significantly.

Just to clarify that. But I do agree that ever since Jordan Hamson left, I feel sorry for the PE (fitness management) majors.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2006<br>Class Name: PE273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was the best class I took at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2006<br>Class Name: PE346<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she spends 3 powerpoint presentations on what leadership is. when we complain of her boring lectures, she says &quot;statistics show that college students prefer powerpoints&quot;. Statistics also show that you're an idiot. This class is about managing organizations for sports. what she needs to do is learn how to manage a class. check plz!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/27/2006<br>Class Name: PE346OTHERS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WOW. WHat an inspirational teacher! 5 years later I will look back and thank her for &quot;purposely&quot; being a terrible teacher so that we can learn from her mistakes. Thank you so much! And take this class if you want a lousy GPA. It will humble you! Such a deep, compassionate teacher.
