    Professor Lemmons is a really stand up guy with a real passion for music and music theory. Integrated into rock music, I think Chris did a fantastic job with the class. He is extremely disorganized, and I had no idea what my grade in the class was at all times, but the class was easy and an interesting way to fulfill art and lit credit.

    History of rock music was an awesome class. Lemons knew everything about everything, and he helped you understand as well. You have to go to the class and take notes, and you'll pass. The listening lists are important as well. He has a weird, yet awesome, sense of humor. "Let's get back in out Doctor Who phone booth's..." take this class if you can

    Extremely easy professor if you attend lectures, but be sure to take notes. Not a whole lot of textbook usage. When life gives you Lemons, take that class!

    Not as bad as everyone says, but it pays to have a bit of background in music if you're going to take this class, as he delves into a lot of topics that are probably way too hard for non-musicians. Also, be prepared for some pretty crazy quirks, including his extremely verbose way of speaking. Not great, but not terrible

    This guy is strange/goofy but has a very unique sense of humor and knows an insane amount about all music. If you take notes and listen you'll ace the midterm, the rest of the work is easy and the textbook is not a necessity.

    Don't take his theory class unless it's something you're really interested in. He introduces difficult material and expects you to catch on fast. He's a little pompous and has a really dry sense of humor, but if you can handle it, his course will really give you a challenge.

    REALLY DRY.  Very boring.  Can be really condescending towards students.  I did not like his opinion of what good examples of rock bands were.  Came off as really elitist.

    Worst musicianship professor I have ever had. My class got stuck with him after the administration decided to make some changes, and it was a bad idea. The music and theory of the class is incomprehensible in the midst of all of his weird comments, like &quot;tweet tweet tweet&quot;. Worst professor ever, don't take him if you can avoid him!

    He is really passionate about his subject, which you think would be great. but he gets upset when you dont know what he is talking about, which will be more then half the time. Dont miss class or else you'll really feel behind + he makes no effort to help anyone. dont take this class unless youre really really into opera!

    He is so unclear about everything, the description of the class sounds great, but the class itself has nothing to do with it. You spend most of your time on opera, so if you like sitting for an hour and half being confused and bored, this is the class for you. And he is VERY strange!

    He is the most unclear professor i have ever had. He assumes you know what he is talking about even though this class is for non music majors. He has no text book so he basically writes four words on the board and talks about them.The midterm is hard even though he gives you exactly what to study.He is crazy and theworst professor ever!!!!

    I tried to meet him outside of class. He refused to meet me, said he would e-mail me. Never did. Never was clear on homework. Class was for non-music majors and my roommates who played instruments for years still had trouble when I asked them for help. Didn't go over any of the homework or the mid-term. Not organized. One of the worst teachers

    Lemons is probably from another planet, according to him &quot;Zork&quot;. But if you want to laugh your as off all day long because of the weird**** he says (which is extremely entertaining) I sugggest you take him. I had an awesome time, if you work u'll be fine.

    ive been top of my music class since 4th grade and ended up with a C in his class.  he's boring, teaches highly unimportant material, and expects too much.  be prepared to memorize over 50 classical songs by heart and go to two concerts to write papers for each.  terrible teacher.

    Not bad, not great.  Knows EVERYTHING about what he's talking about and the class itself isn't all that hard (some busy work, but nothing extreme).  He is a very strange guy, though.  Lots of weird little quirks about him that can get annoying really fast

    Very confusing but very easy.  Gives a lot of tedious homework, but very easy.  You turn in everything at the end of the quarter.  He jumps around on the subject matter though, which totally confused me. I ended up with an A though.

    not the best teacher, lacks in theory. but new class for him, so adjusting&#63; he avoids questions much of the time. has entertaining/annoying habits, such as &quot;ch ch ch ch ch&quot; when he thinks, and wants you to teach yourself doing what he calls

    Not a good teacher at all. Very confusing on what the subject matter is that he is talking about and tends to stray. Esp bad at theory. Only get through Brahms when others have made it all the way to Debussey. Expects you to teach yourself.
