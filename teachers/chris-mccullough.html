Will meet with you any time outside of class, if needed.  Very kind and caring professor.  Made research interesting and bearable-- who doesn't love playing 'Who wants to Be a Millionaire' as a way to learn&#63;  Good professor, great person!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/01/2009<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the few great teachers at DePaul.  Truly cares about his students--and our learning and professional development.  He's quirky, interesting, and entertaining.  I fully expected a class on research to be painfully dull, but he made it great.  Really great guy!  Highly recommend any class taught by him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2009<br>Class Name: SCG410<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is amazing!

The material is difficult, but he understands this and is willing to be available for students to pick his brain.  Also, not a bad man to stare at for a few hours a week.</div></div></div></body></html>
