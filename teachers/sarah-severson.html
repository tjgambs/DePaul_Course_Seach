It is supposed to be INTRO to Sociology, not SOC300. Didn't even buy the book at I got a B+. She is awful with time management and will go off ranting about women's rights, so you have to teach yourself the material in order to pass. And stuff is on her tests that she didn't even mention. Good luck.</div></div></div></body></html>
