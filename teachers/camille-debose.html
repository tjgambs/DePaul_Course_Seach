I have taken her Digital photography class and ethics in video games and cinema. She doesn't ask much from you, just do what is required. Ask for help, and clear up things when they get confusing (bc sometimes they do). Her charisma and laughter is what keeps me in the class. Her love for photography and her sensible humor is great!  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2015<br>Class Name: DC228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The most confusing class and professor I have ever encountered. The class was so unorganized and she blamed it all on how messed up d2l was. She complains about D2L but never updated our grades or gave feedback. 4 papers (confusing), 4 tests, a cumulative final and participation required. I do not recommend her at all!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2015<br>Class Name: GAM228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Camille was awesome! I expected the class to be something different so I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It proved to be difficult at times but she was always there to help and gave great feedback. She is a great individual and a fantastic teacher. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2015<br>Class Name: IT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing class, I would recommend to any student. Not difficult at all, If you try you will do well in her class. This class helped me decide my major. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2015<br>Class Name: GAM228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know about the other reviews but this is by far the worst class I've taken. This is literally like an English 101 class. She wants lots of papers due and they're all guided by her weird criteria. Some require drawing charts etc. As an adult student, I don't know what these kids see in writing their reviews. Not hard but lots of writing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: GAM228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is easy. The readings are reasonable but it's just too dry. She talked a whole class about one of our assignments and later emailed us telling us that what she said in class was wrong. Although she is easy, I've had better ethics class than this. Every class seems like a argument and counter argument. Boring, dry class but easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2014<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a very nice teacher but took forever to grade your work.

She actually reads your work and expects you to read the book.  If you write crap she gives you a crap grade.  If you write good work you get a pretty good grade.  Overall her class isn?t hard at all.  If you do poorly you should probably learn to read or drop out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2010<br>Class Name: DC210<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has absolutely no business teaching production.  She was very nice, and I've heard good things about her in other classes.  She handled the students well (which was difficult sometimes).  The one issue, however, is that you will learn NOTHING about production.  This is a vital class for my major and I feel unprepared for my other classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2010<br>Class Name: DC205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is EASY. Thought she was ok (even though she's pretty pretentious)...but then she lost one of my quizes. I asked her about it and she would never respond to me. I had an A in the class otherwise, but because of her I got a B+. Garbage. I got A's in Accounting, but a B+ in THAT class&#63;! I don't know how teachers get away with this stuff...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: DC225<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Camille, she has so much personality and won't care if you need an extra day to finish an assignment.  DO NOT take her for Production.  Any class but Production.  The thing is she is a closeted hard grader.  She is very strict when it comes to assignment quality, and will send you out with little prior knowledge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: SOC209<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Buying the book was a big waste of money. From it all we had to do is write 3 chapter summaries/analysis. Watched a lot of videos. Class discussions. A final paper and an online midterm. She is very funny and entertaining but not that organized.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You must take her class!

She keeps you incredibly motivated throughout. She genuinely cares about her students and I have the utmost respect for her. I would definitely take another class from her no matter what the subject is. She's really open to extra credit, so if you don't get an A you're probably just lazy. GREAT class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2006<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>CDe is a wonderful professor!
