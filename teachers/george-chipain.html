As an undergrad, I was fortunate to take his class. Super inspirational. Very motivating. Realistic. Lectures aren't boring. Growing up, I hated science because I basically sucked at it. However through this class, Chipain totally changed my perspective about science and I feel more confident teaching it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/19/2008<br>Class Name: TL404<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Teacher.  Glad I had him for my first class in the program.  Powerpoint/Lectures can be a bit on the dry side but he does have a lot of experience and presents the material in a contemporary way that allows students to connect with it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2006<br>Class Name: SCU337<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof. Powerpoints/lectures were boring but his stories were interesting. Open book MT & F (w/study guide). easy A. Way too many dumb comments during discussions, i know too much stupid info on my classmates BOO!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very informative on subject matter.

Not the most interesting class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2006<br>Class Name: SCU337<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful, very nice, easy class, understands that its a required class and some might rather not be there.  However, he goes of on ridiculous tangents all the time, and the class always gets into discussions in which people mostly just debate and don't really learn anything.  Nice guy, hard to say anything bad about him, but just kind of blah..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2005<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful and responsive to e-mails regarding class material.  Currently teaching in CPS so he is able to bring in many topics from school to prepare real teachers.  Very excited about teaching which is contagious.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2005<br>Class Name: SCG408<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Chipain brought a lot of insight to this class, and I really enjoyed his perspective as a current teacher in CPS. I had the class online, and we had a multiple-choice midterm and final, which really surprised me. However, the study guide he gave had the exact topics as were on the test - very helpful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2005<br>Class Name: CHILDDEVELOPME<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun and funny!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2005<br>Class Name: SCG403<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enthusiastic and interesting teacher.  One advantage is that he is a practicing teacher, meaning he teaches 6th grade in addition to teaching this class.  Because of this, he brings all these great stories that are timely and practical.  He focuses on helping you create great activities for your classroom.  He's also really dorky in a good way.</div></div></div></body></html>
