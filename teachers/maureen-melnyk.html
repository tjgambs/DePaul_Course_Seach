I talked in class all the time but missed 2 classes and she gave me a lower participation grade just for that. Tough grader on papers & first movie question sheet was hard and she took points off each question you got wrong. A lot of reading...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2008<br>Class Name: PHL248<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Frankly,it's an interesting class, she just gets old.  Her analogies are terrible and her example are laughable.  She compares Marx to blue jeans..or something, no idea.  Sort of a difficult grader, event though she's not a professor.  Take the class for the material, not this teacher. (plays favorites though, she might like you!)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2008<br>Class Name: PHI248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you have a choice, do not pick her class for business ethics. Tough class because she is very close minded. You either read her mind exactly or interpretation of readings and movies is wrong.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very nice and helpful.

I'm pretty sure she's new to teaching because she required alot. 3 difficult papers. Many people received poor grades. She's a little unclear on what she wants to see becuase she crowds you with information. She's all about attendance and participation.</div></div></div></body></html>
