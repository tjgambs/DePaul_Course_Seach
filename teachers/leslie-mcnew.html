First impressions are imperative and will make or break you. I had a first bad impression and it was a death sentence for me. Tread lightly around her. Not hard to pass the class and do well if you put the time in. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/16/2015<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>extremely rude towards students and have to kiss up really well to have her to like u, hard grader and swears a lot! forces u to buy disk from her for $100 </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/12/2015<br>Class Name: FIN398<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>Hard class, teacher has a nasty attitude (can be very condescending), but you learn a lot. Do not expect an A, unless you spend like 8 hours studying for midtermfinal. I am not taking her again for a long time just because of the attitude factor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2015<br>Class Name: FIN395<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really hard class so if you want an easy A then don't take it.
