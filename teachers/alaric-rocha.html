When i first attended the class i was terrified because i thought that i was judged on if i answered right or wrong, but then i soon learned there is no right or wrong in philosophy. What a relief! We watched a movie every week and went over it the next week. Fairly easy class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2014<br>Class Name: DC376<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great at Discussions and noticing the details. Great movie selection for topics discussed. Gave GREAT advice. However group projects aren't always manageable with commuters. Its the same with every production class, but this class was not a production course so I didn't see its revelance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2014<br>Class Name: DC227<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Rocha is an amazing teacher! This is the second class I have taken with him and it has been so great. The homework is very easy if you are interested in film, and the readings aren't difficult at all. I needed to fill my philosophy credit and I am so happy I chose this class! It is once a week and during class you watch a movie.</div></div></div></body></html>
