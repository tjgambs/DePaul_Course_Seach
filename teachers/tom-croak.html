Fair grader. Extensive reading more important than lectures. Weak: too much lecturing, very little discussion, occasional digressions, too little explicit mention of other thinkers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/12/2004<br>Class Name: HST218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was the best professor that I have had yet.
