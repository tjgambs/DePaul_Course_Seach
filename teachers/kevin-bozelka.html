His writing projects were very clearly outlined, with examples, and were a piece of cake if you followed the outline. Expected collegiate-level work. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny and smart, but his class was extremely challenging.  His papers were so confusing and hard.  You HAVE to read too.  If you don't read at all or skim through the textbook, you'll do poorly on his quizzes and tests.  There was a midterm and final.  It definitely did not feel like I was taking a 100 level course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>Grades harder than my level 400 professors (leaving me unsure of what exactly I'm supposed to be doing). A nice guy, funny, but not a professor I would ever take or recommend. By far the most confusing and difficult level 100 class I've taken in my college career. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kevin is hilarious and knows his stuff, but he is a tough grader on. His lectures are interesting but for an intro class, he expected way too much. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Bozelka made this course a pleasure, he is willing to accept paper drafts and quickly sends feedback that allows for you to know what obstacles your paper faces in pursuit of an 'A' if it is not yet at the level.  His research areas are also very interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>He was a great teacher, a little bit sassy thought. But is willing to help if you ask and is pretty fun. The discussionsquizzes are easy if you did the reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2014<br>Class Name: COMM102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So funny, really great guy! He can ramble on about music or movies, but he's always very passionate about what he talks about. If you get on his good side, you'll have an easier time. Readings are every class, but easy to skim and retain within 15-20 minutes, or the train ride to class--he gives daily writings--very easy. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great guy and knows his stuff, but he grades harder then he really should</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2014<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>He's engaging as hell, and takes the time to get to know his students. He still expects a lot from you though, but keep up on the readings and be prepared to perform and you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2013<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kevin is awesome, he is completely fair and really knows his stuff. He makes class very interesting and not boring at all. If you have the opportunity to take him do it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: MCS208<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Professor. Take any class by Kevin and you will not be disappointed! He's challenging but fair. He really wants the best for his students-to learn and EARN grades showing they did just that. Love him, he's pretty cooky but cool.</div></div></div></body></html>
