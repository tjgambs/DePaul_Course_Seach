He really wants every student engaged in every class. 2 absences are allowed before it affects your grade, which is reasonable. The class came together quite well about 13 of the way into the quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: GER105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Eugene is great! Although he always gives homework, it's usually not too involved, maybe watch some videos and read some in the text book (which is required, it's used both inside and outside of class). He really is helpful and obviously wants you to succeed. Even though I hate speaking in class, it's required, but Eugene makes it fun. A++++++</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2014<br>Class Name: 24227<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Eugene Sampson was the first professor I had at DePaul University (I had him for my Discover Chicago--German class). He made the transition to college so easy. I also had him for German 104. I cannot stress enough how kind, helpful, & passionate he is.  He helped make the Discover class feel like a family.  We all loved Eugene so much and miss him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: GER101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives you so many opportunities to make up for any mistakes you make. He's willing to go far for his students and I've admired that since I had him for Discover. He makes class worthwhile and his nerdy jokes are fun. He's pretty straight forward and is probably my favorite professor at DePaul. I would've gotten an A but things got in the way</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: DISCOVER<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Hes class is a lot of fun. He cares about you and your success. Class discussions are very interesting and teach you a lot. He never makes anyone feel dumb, he listens to everyone's opinion and responses. He is very clear and  helpful. He makes sure you understand and do good in his class. You must be on time, listen, attend and do your work. EasyA</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2014<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Eugene is an amazing professor.  He made immersion week extremely enjoyable and helped with any questions you might have.  There is a lot of fun places you get to visit for Discover German Chicago.  There is a decent amount of reading, but easy worksheets to go along with them.  No midterm and only a final paper and project!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2014<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Eugene. He is such a cool professor and likes to keep things fun and interesting! He has a great sense of humor and loves big class discussions. I wish I could take another class with him but at least I got to start of my college career with a great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2014<br>Class Name: GER101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives you everything you need to succeed academically and to actually become conversational in basic German.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2014<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved Eugene! He was my Discover instructor and definitely made the transition to college a lot less scary. He was interested in the subject matter and really connected with the students.

He genuinely just wants you to learn. He doesn't make you feel stupid trying to pronounce things. He just wants you to try! Take him! If you do the work, are present and just try, it's an easy A</div></div></div></body></html>
