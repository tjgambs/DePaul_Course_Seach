Classes are either factual lectures or open discussions on assigned readings/videos.....yes, there's quite a bit of those!  They're pretty interesting to read, I found most to be enjoyable and enlightening as pre-med major.  Grading is pretty easy, except he expects more of you on the finals, so be prepared work a little more.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2012<br>Class Name: HLTH201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor!
