We didn't really use the textbook so the slides are what you need to know the most. Some homework problems from the book. He usually explained everything well and told you problems that were likely to appear on the tests. Make sure to attend every class and study a lot, the multiple choice questions can be very tricky. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2015<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the best accounting teacher I've had so far. He's really funny and his lectures are very effective. He knows what to teach and what to focus on. He does have required homework but that was actually really helpful for an accounting class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2015<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>the person below obviously doesn't try hard. yes, he's a read off the powerpoint guy but you knew that coming in if you're on here. He also goes into detail about the slides and gives separate examples. He also clearly says when something is going to be on the final. His witty personality makes class a little easier to sit through. DONT BE LATE </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2015<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You are doing yourself a disservice by taking this professor. Spends most of lecture speaking to students as if they have no interest in being there, while he just reads from PowerPoint slides. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: C</div><div id="right"><div>ACC 102 will be very hard if you don't read the book, do the homework, and asks lots of questions. Lectures are super confusing, so you have to do a lot of work...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really helpful professor. Although he always tell students ok something wrong u will lose credit, but if ur active in the class and at least try to explain and do something to remedy, u will be good. Generally a good professor, u guys can take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2014<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor. If you do what he tells you go to class, read the textbook, and do the homework you will do well. He doesn't test you on minute details like a lot of other accounting professors at depaul. This is the first A I've gotten in an accounting course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: P</div><div id="right"><div>Ed is very knowledgeable and helpful.  You do need to show up on time and not miss a class. But between his power points and lectures you don't have to open the book.  He is very funny and makes the subject a lot more interesting.  Goes over a lot of examples and if you pay attention in class you will be in a good shape.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2014<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is by far the best accounting professor at DePaul. He's a very straightforward lecturer and he doesn't try to trick you or confuse you on exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2014<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Good professor. Explains the material very well. There is 1 quiz, midterm, and final. The midterm was more difficult than the final. the final was fairly easy. Attendance is mandatory and deducts points for absences. He is a funny guy and entertaining. Class is not difficult if you pay attention and study.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2013<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Kabialis is the best I have had at DePaul. He makes learning fun and presents the info clearly. His real world experience is extremely helpful. He is always willing to help and never makes you feel bad for asking.Take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2013<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was always willing to help if you needed it. He talks straight from the powerpoints and doesn't have you do many problems on your own. 2 quizzes that were take home and midterm and final. Problems were just like the ones in class. Has a curve</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/24/2013<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mostly straightforward. Exam questions from the homework. But beware of any quizzes and deadlines. I missed the 1 quiz cause of traffic and it cost me 50 pts (worth 5 weeks of class or all the hmwk).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2012<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Like one guy said, hes a powerpoint guy,  he is in class an hour before you get there just so you can go and ask him questions, so you cant say he wasnt there to help, very approachable and patient, dont be tardy or late,</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2012<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The Guy actually cares about helping you,but he has many deficiencies.The guy explains the powerpoints ONLY, and he did not do a good job at it. MOST of the stuff that he added was not relevant to the exams. To me atleast, he did not make the topics clear. He rambles on when you ask questions. You have to study HARDER than other teachrs to get  B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unbiased review. He is a typical PowerPoint "clarifier" (basically reads the PowerPoints and asks if you understand it or not). Doesn't look at HW he assigns. Exams based on PowerPoints, but I didn't like how 1 MC question is worth almost the same as 1 problem, and accounting is all about problems. Good luck memorizing concepts. STUDY!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2012<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Ed's Cost Acc. class last year.  I'm now taking the CPA exam and his class helped me prepare for it in a major way.  He's one of the brightest and helpful professors at DePaul and you're lucky to have him.  Unlike many "theoretical" profs, Ed comes from a distinguished career and has helped me with invaluable career advice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2012<br>Class Name: ACC305<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He presents the material in a clear and applicable manner. He basically gives hints throughout the quarter on what questions to expect on the midterm and final. He was an audit partner at a big 4 firm, so he is always providing examples from real life situations. Knows his stuff! If you come to class and pay attention, it's not a difficult class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2012<br>Class Name: ACC306<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rates himself frequently on this site. He will come off as offended if you ask him for help, and give a rushed and useless explanation to your questions. Very demeaning in general.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2011<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is great! Very straightforward. Midterm, Final and a quiz here and there- gives partial credit on exams. Such a great guy and really cares about his students. At this point you're an accounting major, be prepared to do the work and no doubt you'll get a good grade--he's funny too</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2011<br>Class Name: ACC304<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To the guy who wrote &quot;Expects too much from students in an entry level accounting class&quot;.... umm kiddo this isn't an entry level class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2011<br>Class Name: ACC220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Total dictatorial when it comes to grading ....

I felt like I was taking the CPA exam, I might have underestimated him but the whole class agreed that most the material on midterm was not even covered in class. Bogus&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63; I think so!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tests are HARD, and I mean HARD. But again nothing in life is easy, though most students in class had same complain he moves through chapters too fast.

Be prepared to spend a lot of time outside of class for this class, and maybe visit tutors as well. Unless your good at teaching yourself, then this should be a piece of cake.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2011<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hes very tough, and covers too much material too fast and if your not keeping up with the class your out of luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2010<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No matter the subject of Ed is teaching TAKE HIM... he will make every topic crystal clear and will respond to students needs.

I have ever had!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ed is amazing. Cost Acounting is very tough, but he will email, meet with you and answer questions in class until you get it. He's an overall great guy and awesome professor. TAKE THIS GUY!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2010<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is the best, but I won't lie his tests are very hard. 66% of a test is T/F and Multiple choice dealing with accounting theories and problem solving. Then 33% is solving word problems. Only prob is he doesn't really tell you what will be on final except telling you to read pages from book. He curves the grades so maybe it will be ok.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/23/2010<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The rating below is what you would call a baby. When the class doesn't ask questions he will say things like &quot;wow you guys must be smart&quot; or &quot;at this point someone will ask a question, since no one is asking I guess I'll do your job&quot;. He says stuff like this in a sarcastic tone. If you get offended by this, then I don't see how you became a grad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/18/2010<br>Class Name: ACC555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was his first class teaching grad students, and overall, I wasn't impressed. His teaching style is adequate, if not lazy. But he was at times a downright a jerk. Our class apparently didn't ask enough questions for him, so he would belittle us. Maybe it's okay for the undergrads, but we're not kids, and I didn't like being treated like one.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2010<br>Class Name: ACC103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>cool guy and helpful. only problem is he's a close talker... you ever see that seinfeld episode where elaine's new boyfriend gets in everyones face when he's having a conversation with him and it makes it awkward.... yea well that's this guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DEPAUL HAS FOUND A DIAMOND IN THIS GUY!

He teaches VERY well, makes sure you understand the material so you don't have to just teach yourself like you might in other acc classes, and he is specific to what he wants you to know. He doesn't give out &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; so you'd get a solid grade like an A, B, or C. Most get B's.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2009<br>Class Name: ACC303<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Kabialis is so knowledgeable of the material! Depaul should have more teachers like him! he does everything in his power to help his students & if you dont work dont expect to get a good grade.

If you EVER needed any help related to accounting, he was more than happy to help. His exams are not easy. He makes you really know the material to succeed. I would take him again.
