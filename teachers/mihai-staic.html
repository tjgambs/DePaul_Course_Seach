    Best math professor I had thus far. Really cares for his students to understand the material and do well in his class. Highly recommended!

    Great teacher who really clarified what he was teaching. If you didn't understand the material, just ask him to clarify and he'll go through another problem. The quizzes in class are important. If you do well on the class quizzes, you'll be fine. Just make sure to get 100's on the hw and quizzes online.
