She curves a lot though, so a raw score of 70 on a test could still keep you an A. She  applies the material to real life to keep it interesting, amazing person too. Her biggest flaw is that she is too nice. She can't tell someone they are wrong and has to waste time to sugarcoat it. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/16/2015<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Pay attention to the lectures and her examples. Very identical to the tests. Tough tests and group project but not impossible,</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/29/2014<br>Class Name: AUDIT1<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING PROFESSOR! I wish I had her energy. She makes such a difficult subject fun and easy to comprehend. Would absolutely take again and recommend to others. Don't buy the book- no use. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2013<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She doesn't use the book so don't buy it! Unless you need additional help. She also prints out the slides (she calls them modules) for you. The only problem I had with her is that her diagrams can sometimes be a little confusing, but just ask her to explain and she will be more than happy to! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2013<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best accounting professor I have ever taken! She's funny, quirky, and explains everything clearly. She's also very passionate about what she does. There's weekly online quizzes, 1 group project, and 3 tests. It may seem like alot, but it's not really. Her tests are kinda hard, so make sure to study. She also curves your grade at the end.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2013<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>professor sedor is one of the best professors out there.  you will not find a professor more willing to go out of her way to make sure that the students know and understand the material.  material is hard but she does a great job breaking it down.  DONT BE AFRAID TO ASK QUESTIONS!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2012<br>Class Name: ACC374<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>3 test, partner project, online weekly quizzes, atendance are all part of the grade so if you bomb a test you wont fail the class although the tests are not easy so you really need to study. She is super nice sometimes lecture can get boring but she prints out all the slides for you and you dont need to read entire chapters just sections</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2011<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Sedor is the best professor I have ever taken at DePaul. She is funny, super nice and very excited about the subject. She explains everything clearly and gives good examples. It was not an easy course but as long as you listen to her lectures you will do great. Take her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2011<br>Class Name: ACCT372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AMAZING PROFESSOR! She will go on and beyond to help you and make sure you understand the material. The subject is hard and her exams are very tricky, but you learn a lot. I would recommend her anytime! BUY THE BOOK! It's really useful too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2011<br>Class Name: ACCAUD<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lisa's the best!

Take her for audit for sure. As long as you read and follow her in class you will do good.  Her multiple choices are a little tricky, but she makes you think of the broad picture rather than just memorizing things for the test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2011<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>brutal class, would not recommend. exams questions are cpa audit portion adapted. if your goal is to get prepared for cpa, take her. if your goal is to just get your bachelors, avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is AMAZING. she prints out the PPP for you and explains everything really well. she loves her job and is so welcoming when you go to her office hours.her exams are very reasonable, no surprises and and if you just do some reading, study her own PPP you will do great. There are three exams, and they're not cumulative. take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2010<br>Class Name: ACC372<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I have ever had at DePaul. I have been here 3 and a half years and I have never had a teacher more encouraging, or as helpful as she is. Auditing is a very hard class, and she made is enjoyable, and easy to grasp. I loved this teacher and I would take her again in a heartbeat!! The content of the class isn't bad either.</div></div></div></body></html>
