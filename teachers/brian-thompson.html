Very tough class and LOTS of work. Two group presentations and one final. Walked out with a C after pulling several all-nighters but still wish I had him for all my finance classes. He is not the guy for you if you just want an easy pass but he really is the BEST! Highly recommended if you actually wanna learn something.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2015<br>Class Name: FIN525<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Call you randomly by name.

It is a tough class, weekly  group case study which is then discussed during class. Two group presentations over a case study (not bad at all, simple power point & very low key). He calls on people randomly, which I usually hate but he's still awesome. My favorite teacher since I started at DePaul  & I highly recommend.</div></div></div></body></html>
