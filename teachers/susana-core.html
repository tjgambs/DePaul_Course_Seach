It's almost impossible to understand her. She is constantly making errors in her own math. She is very helpful and always trying to help her students however. She saved students money on textbooks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take her class!! Incredibly enthusiastic and genuinely wants her students to get an A. Will provide formulas most of the time for quizzes. One homework a week. Extra credit if you come to all classes. Quizzes are easy and she won't mark you down for the wrong answer if you have the concept pretty much down.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2012<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best teacher in the world take her! its a no brainer!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2011<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Susana Core is an AWESOME Math teacher! I took Calc 1 at a different school and got a C in it but when I took her class for Business Calc 2 I got an A in the class! She is the EASIEST grader you'll find! I got a 100% on my midterm even though I had stuff wrong! You have a weekly homework assignment but thats about it! If you want an A take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2011<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Math teacher EVER!!! Math has always been my worst subject but she makes it so easy to understand. She is also very funny! Classes don't drag, homework can be a little long at times but it's all fair. She's a fair grader and really cares about her student! Highly Recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2011<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Susana is AWESOME! I took her for both Bus Calc II, and Stats. She is the sweetest woman you will ever meet. I often had the urge just to hug her! She is very funny and a great teacher. She cares immensely about student's learning & success. It is more than feasible to earn an A in this class. I'll definitely miss Susana!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2011<br>Class Name: STAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE SUSANA. Nicest teacher ever. She is like your grandma, but supper smart and good at explaining math. She really cares about students and wants you to do well. 3 percentage points of EC if you do not miss any classes. Grades quizes easy, you can get things wrong and still get a 100. Doesn't go to fast, very reasonable in her expectations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2011<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is just an eccentric woman and just has the best personality. She is just one of those few people you won't forget. She does her best to clarify her explanation and is willing to spend the whole class explaining her methods and encourage the students the ask question even if its the stupidest thing a person can think of.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Susana is so sweet and very funny! Class is always a bit disorganized, but it generally does not get in the way of learning. Susana is very lenient with grading, on the midterm with the curve, I got over 100. Extra credit is given to those who attend class regularly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm in Susana's Calc II class and I actually understand whats going on. I have done well on all the quizzes and homework and got an A on the Midterm thanks to her curve. I don't have the solution book thats recommended. I hear it is worth buying though. Great Teacher. Super easy for a Calc class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's awesome!  Makes the class fun.  If you want to pass, just show up and do the homework.  She's definately worth the wait.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST math teacher ever. she isnt that hard to understand at all. as long as u put in effort and she sees it ull be fine.

She wants to be helpful, but she's hard to understand. She doesn't grade, some math dept person does, and the grader is a pretentious jackass. tests are cumulative so be warned. Ok teacher, not great, not awful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the most genuine professor at DePaul. She is concerned with each and everyone of her students and will bed over backwards for you to succeed. I never liked math, but taking her I actually like it now. I went to her office hours and she stayed almost two hours past it to make sure I understood the material.So glad I took her class! Amazing Professor</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2010<br>Class Name: MAT137<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Susana is the bomb! She helps whenever you need her. She wants you to succeed! At the end of each quiz, she lets you work with a partner so be sure to stay! She is the nicest professor I have ever had! highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2010<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very helpful! as long as you try you should be fine! if it wasnt for her i would not understand calc! math is not my strong point. if its not yours u should def take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2010<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not very clear but omg, is she helpful! She will try her best to get you to understand the material if you ask her to.  She let's you use notes, makeup homework, etc. Very sweet lady. I had such a hard time getting good scores in the quizzes/exams but she was very nice by at least rewarding my efforts.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2010<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, this prof seems disheveled on the outside, but she's an AMAZING person aside from being a BRILLIANT prof. Ppl who wrote about her clothes, hair, etc. would be ashamed after hearing her life story. She is the best professor I have ever had and her Spanish &quot;umm&quot;s do not take away from understanding the material. TAKE HER YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME PROFESSOR! The nicest and most helpful professor I have EVER encountered. She willing to stay and help students after class any time they needed it. I witnessed her stay an additional 1-2 hours after a night class on several occasions! Actually teaches you something and allows you to redo problems for half credit! TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice and really helpful. I took her for a 3 hour night class and I thought I would be dieing, but she is always so excited and hyper its awesome. She's pretty funny too, in a weird foreign way. You 5% added to your grade just for coming to all the classes. Best math teacher at DePaul, she knows how to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2009<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. I have taken her twice, she truly cares about you learning and will do whatever it take to help you. She also makes you feel very comfortable. In my class all but five people took her for 126. If you need a teacher that helps you with BMS take Susana, her accent seems difficult but it's worth it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2009<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this professor! All the comments about her are true. If you attempt to do the homework you get all the points, can make up missed test points, and will stay after set office hours until she is sure you understand and can pass the class. Show up, take notes and try, you should pass!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2009<br>Class Name: BMS142<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes super nice and is always willing to help. Sometimes shes hard to understand but as long as you copy her examples down, you're good to go! The best part is, she doesnt want anyone to do bad so she allows &quot;makeup&quot; points for the midterm!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you go to class its a 5% increase on your final grade.  The other benefits stated below are also true. Hard to understand, but if you just copy her problems you should have a basic understanding. If you speak Spanish use it because it helps build a relationship with her which then increases your grade. Hyper and crazy at times but nice lady.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lets you make half the points you missed in the test. you can bring half of paper to test. just show up and do the homework and read the book and you will pass the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Susana is very interested in the subject and the student. She wants everyone to pass, she will even stay after office hours until you get it. She goes over homework before class. You can make up points missed from a test. And is one of the sweetest teachers at DePaul. I will be taking her for another math class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Susana is indeed sort of hyper, but she is really nice and caring. Will go out of her way to help anyone learn and pass.  She lets you make up lost points so long you can show to have learned the topic.  Calculus was never my strong subject, but I found myself getting learning a lot and getting a good grade. TAKE HER! I'd love to have her again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Susana is a nice person and cares about you passing, however her accent is hard to miss and she adds Spanish words in when she can't think of the English word. Her tests are somewhat hard but she lets you make up some of your lost points in office hours. She collects homework but barely grades it at all. She's not too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As the previous rater mentioned, yes this woman is psycho, she has one crazy accent and it has been 5 weeks into the quarter, yet she wears the same shirt to class all the time, and is in serious need of a hair makeover! But, I find the material to be average, she basically goes over all the HW in class right BEFORE you turn it in which is nice..</div></div></div></body></html>
