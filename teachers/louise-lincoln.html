I learned a lot in the class but it was hard to get through certain lectures. It was a bit nervewracking because she never really made clear what was expected of us, for papers and such. Overall a good professor - just be prepared to work hard!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: ART382<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She knows what she is talking about.
