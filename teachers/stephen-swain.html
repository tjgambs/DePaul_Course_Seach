The three essay's you have to do are fairly simple in nature. Readings are also interesting and short! Fairly easy grader and lenient with due dates if need be.Pretty laid-back with his teaching style and has a geeky sense of humor...making this mandatory class a bit more tolerable.Definitely recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and person overall.

He's a corny funny guy. Our class was based on social media and he made the connections work. He worked w me in regards to late assignments or redoing work. He was very lax with grades. He made it a point to know names and faces. I have taken WRD 104 3 times and he was the BEST professor EVER.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is interesting and super funny!
