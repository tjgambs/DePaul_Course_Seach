Her experience and knowledge adds to her lectures. She will always add real-world examples and is very clear. Her tests and quizzes are all online, so be sure to take notes during her lectures.

She's an awesome professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2014<br>Class Name: ECO106<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Her lectures drag on because all she does is talk, but her notes actually help if your mind doesn't wander. I took for for ECO 105 as well and the classes are set up the same way. 2 attempts on every quiz, the midterm and final, all online, and it's so easy to get an A on them because of the 2 attempts. Highly recommend her!

ALL YOU NEED TO SUCCEED: 1) Print out notes before class, 2) Go to every class, 3) take notes during class, 4) Do the online quizzes. Seriously, that's it. None of the material is that complicated and the best part is you don't even need the textbook.

The only way you will get an A is if you work really hard and take VERY diligent notes in class.

I want to say that the class is easy because all the exams are take home online, but they are very difficult. There is no hw so its easy to fall behind and slack off. You also don't need the book. Make sure to do the extra credit assignment she gives out because they will boost your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2011<br>Class Name: ECO509<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a PhD from U of C so shes is very intelligent.
