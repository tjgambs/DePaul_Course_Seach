Not clear on what he wants. hoenstly, i think hes just lazy. the class basically involves the students teaching each other. If the client sucks, the quarter will suck. Hes good for career advice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2010<br>Class Name: MKT356<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too much group work and class exercises. if you have a good client it will be interesting. the class is very helpful and i learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/24/2009<br>Class Name: MKT356<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Learn more in 10 weeks in the IME program than what can be taken out of my first 3 years of college.
