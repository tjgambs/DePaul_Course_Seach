    Dr. Karver takes a typically tough subject like Organic Chemistry and walks students through the course step-by-step in the best way possible. Her tests mirror the worksheets given in class and she hosts worksheet days for every chapter allowing students to work through the material in class and ask for help as they need it. She is fantastic.

    Yeah, sure, organic chemistry is hard.  That's why you want to take Dr. Karver.  You need a professor who is going to explain the material clearly in an organized manner, and that is her.  Tests are not easy and she has high expectations, but that's why we're in college.  I appreciate my experience with Dr. Karver.

    She is one of the nicest teachers. Recognizes the course is hard but provides you with very useful feedback. Attending office hours is a must so be sure to schedule your own if hers don’t fit your schedule. Is a soft talker but knows what she is talking about. Take advantage of worksheet days!

    Dr. Karver is an excellent professor, incredibly knowledgeble, and approachable.  She isn't a pushover and has high expectations, but that's what professors are for.  The course is tough, but if you put time in to studying you'll get a fair grade.  Go to her office hours to get help, she really appreciates it.  I highly recommend Dr. Karver.

    Very interesting course. Well taught. Quizzes varied among multiple choice, short answer, and group work. Tests were pretty difficult, but the final was easy (because exam 2 was difficult). These things may change because it was the first time this course was offered, but she's fair in her grading and isn't out to fail her students. Study the ppts.

    Too many people bash on Dr. Karver for being a hard professor. She's tough, but she is so intelligent and extremely helpful. Tests require EXTENSIVE knowledge on everything she lectures on, but they are not impossible if you study more than just the day before the exam. Difficult, yes. But she'll love you and show it if you do well in her class.

    Dr. Karver is great. The class material is naturally tough, but she presents the material in an excellent way. She makes no errors during lecture and truly takes time for each student. Take her!

    Dr. Karver is a great professor; she genuinely cares about her students and is very knowledgeable about the topic. It’s Organic Chemistry, it’s going to be hard, but the tests are similar to the in-class worksheets. People that are blaming her, obviously didn't study enough...not her fault. Office hours are limited, but she will make time for you.

    Shes a very hard professor all the notes are from the book, so read the book. Exams are very hard so you need to put a lot of effort into studying. Not very helpful in her office hours. I put a lot of effort to receive a passing grade but I will definitively not recommend her!!

    People who are bashing out at Dr. Karver obviously didn't put in effort to study for this class. It's organic chemistry and its gonna be tough. She's a great professor who wants her students to do well. Definitely take her for organic!!!

    Dr. Karver is a great professor. She's a very sweet and approachable person. Read the book before lecture and it will make so much more sense. It is organic chemistry so you need to do all of studying on your own in order to do well. If you don't understand anything, just go to her office hours and she's more than happy to explain it to you.

    Dr. Karver is a great professor, some may have issues with the class but it mostly stems from the fact it is ORGANIC chemistry. It's not supposed to be a cakewalk. She adjusts every semester and has gotten better week by week. Do the homework, go to class and read the book. It's very possible to do well. Wonderful person who wants you to suceed.
