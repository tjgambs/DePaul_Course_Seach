    Nice professor, however, not the best to capture my attention. She mainly just gives the lectures and then we have a midterm (also movie screenings each week). I was never interested in history, so she didn't get my attention that much. I have to take this class as a DC major though, but to anyone who loves history, this class for you.

    pretty easy, she knows what she's talking about, just follow her clear directions and you'll be fine. no need to buy book everything you need to know she will teach you.

    Fun and interactive class. Some lecture, then watch movies and discuss. The papers aren't difficult and you do two short movie projects which are fun. Easy grader. The final was totally based on lectures. No need to read the book if you attend lectures (which is required anyway) and take good notes. Definitely recommended. Take her.

    Has a deep knowledge of film history and an EXCELLENT way of communicating it to the class. She's very articulate, which is very helpful in a history class. She can answer almost any question with confidence. Will definitely take her again and recommend to anyone. The tests are difficult, IMO, but she gives a pretty good study guide beforehand.

    A very good professor. Teaches all three history of film classes. She has quite a vast knowledge of film and shows good movies in the labs. The long lectures can get kind of boring, but just stay active and you'll do fine. Exams are a breeze if you just do some studying. I have learned so much from this class

    She is SOOOO smart.  Very knowledgeable in the subject, but not the mostthrilling/fun class.  Fell asleep on occasion (which I usually never do).  If you like the subject, take the class, if not , don't

    If you are thinking about taking FIlm history, from when it started, be prepared for the most boring class of your life.  It is easy if u are a nerd. Shes nice though

    Great teacher! She's very helpful and its obvious she wants all her kids to pass her class. Her midterm and final are just watching movies and analyzing them. Take her!

    I agree with the other comments for the most part.  I took her for the first part of the DC history sequence though and found the class to be quite boring.  She's definitely helpful, clear, and knowledgable, but doesn't do much to spice up the material.

    Great teacher, soo nice, soo helpful, and very smart.  Tolerant of the many idiots that pass through Communications.  Never really thought about the hair, but it is nice.  I bet she's older than she looks.

    at first she was a little scary - but it turns out she's very cool. she even seems a little shy in class, but her screenwriting advice is great, and she shows some hilarious clips. good sense of humor, even better hair.
