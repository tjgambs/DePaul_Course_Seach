All the homework is online and I email her with questions all the time and she answers almost immediately and is so helpful. The quizzes are like the homework. Grades quickly. Physics is hard, but with Dr. Fischer it makes the subject much easier. I'm lost in the class and still managed a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2014<br>Class Name: 150<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: D</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Fischer is an amazing physics teacher! She's so very helpful. It's definitely my fault that I didn't do so well in her class, but if you ask questions, stay focused, and do the homework, you'll pass with flying colors. She's also awesome at answering emails!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2011<br>Class Name: PHY151<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for 150 and 151 and am still upset she's not teaching 152 (which I'm currently in). TAKE HER! the physics book is unclear, it just spews out equations at you, but Dr. Fischer's lectures make the picture clear. the class is a challenge, but you will learn. unfortunately, not all physics prof.s have her style :(</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: PYS150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher overall so sweet! However I hated webassign it didn't help you learn anything basically instead of learning it the old fashion way you have to deal with the fussy program. Webassign is the worst thing about this class. Lab is fair and fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/09/2008<br>Class Name: PHY150<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hate WebAssign.  Take her class and so will you.  It's for the weak and lazy.  She, unfortunately, seems to be both.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2006<br>Class Name: PHY120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is a bit difficult, but I have never been good with science. If you have never taken physics before you can still get what is going on. She has tons of office hours and is willing to go over things again if you bring in questions. Also grades on a curve and really likes participation! Super nice teacher... good for science requirement</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2005<br>Class Name: PHY172<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you don't think she is one of the nicest and most helpful professors.... i will have to beat you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2004<br>Class Name: PHY170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2004<br>Class Name: PHY170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the nicest professor i have this year but the class is a hard one but she is willing to help out until you get it... i like dr. fischer a lot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awww..dr. fischer is so sweet :) shes a great teacher and really helpful!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2003<br>Class Name: PHY360361<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have had Dr. Fischer for 5 physics courses and she is the nicest woman I have come across at DPU, but don't let it fool you...the classes are still tough!
