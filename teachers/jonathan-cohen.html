    By far one of the worst professors at DePaul. He didn't prepare for any lectures and showed an overall disinterest in the class and his students. He'll barely look up from reading from the book to you and he avoids answering questions (it's unclear whether he  just doesn't know how to answer them or he just doesn't care). Do not take him!

    I admit that I struggle with learning math but this guy did not help me at all :/ he expects you to already know what he knows and he gives an in class exam before the final! I had to try and teach myself math and go to the tutoring center to understand the lectures. He seems all over the place and is unsure about some of the problems he works out

    I love this guy, but I have a feeling the people who will come out of his class having learned (and laughed) the most are fellow math nerds. I can see how people can get confused by his teaching because he can easily skip a few steps from one thing to the next, but if you think like a mathematician, like him, it is pretty easy to follow.

    He can make corny jokes in class here and there but overall I was very happy to have left his class because I found it nearly impossible to understand a lot of the material.  During class lectures he talks in a very monotone voice which is very hard to pay attention to and he doesn't explain the material that coherently.

    Cohen really knows his stuff. You cant expect him to hold your hand and walk you through everything. You actually have to ask questions and make connections on your own. Overall he's pretty funny given he's semi old. Gives review for test that are very helpful and homework online and written. Semi easy grader

    He really knows his math but no one understood what he was talking about in lecture. You have to do a lot of learning on your own. The class was easy to pass because he gives you study guides which are almost exactly the same as the exams.

    He's a very nice funny guy who's tests are relatively fair given the tough material. That said, he is not very easy to learn from. I have had more luck typically just trying to get through the book by myself, but not the WORST you can do if you can teach yourself some

    If you're capable of learning on your own, the class is cake. Your grade = 30% HW + 20% midterm1 + 20% midterm2 + 30% final. He tells you exactly which problems will be on the exams so...no reason not to get near 100%. As a professor, Cohen is not-the-best (to say the least). Reading the book for 1.5 hrs is more useful than going to lecture.

    It's hard enough to learn real analysis without Cohen teaching it. He is a great and funny guy who means well, but as a professor he is confusing and sometimes unprepared. However, he's very knowledgeable and willing to work with you, so if you have a strong interest and work ethic, then a class with Cohen is manageable.

    He's allright, but makes mistakes constantly. You'll have to do some serious work in his classes- they're not easy, but not impossible either. He doesn't care if you show up to class, but it can be worth it just for his dry sense of humor.

    He seems to help out the ones that are in danger of failing the class.  If you do your homework you get to drop one of the three test or half of the final, so it's best to do it but it's not mandatory.

    Cohen is probably one of the coolest professors out there. Because he's a real teacher. He won't do the work for you. But if you collaborate with others, do the work, and ask questions: You actually understand what the heck is going on!! Rock on Cohen!

    His tests are not too difficult, they are just like everything that is on the objective sheet and he goes through those problems in class! The homework is only 10 problems a week and you get to drop your homework grade or a test grade! I thought he was a decent teacher and was helpful outside of class.

    DO NOT take this teacher!  He is very unhelpful and not clear at all!  He doen't put the section on the board and you never know what he is doing or why.  I had to switch matht teachers in the middle of the quarter because he refused to teach me and told me to go figure it out myself.

    He's not the best lecturer, but if you can get used to his teaching style, then he's fine. He's any easy grader and very fair (he looks for what you know, and not what you don't). Also, his jokes are so bad you just have to laugh at them. He seems like a nice guy, just a little disorganized.

    He is a horrible speaker. He also mumbles, which makes it much worse to understand such a difficult subject matter. Reading the book is more helpful than going to class. If you like math, try to find another professor that will keep you interested in the subject, because he is not motivating at all.

    He's GREAT! He explains concepts in a simple fashion. He's entertaining cuz his jokes are so lame you just HAVE to laugh. A great morning class to take. Grades fairly, giving points for just about everything. Four tests in all, drops lowest grade, homework counts for a test grade too. Recommended!

    Not very clear.  His lectures went on and on and were not clear at all.  I'm good at math, and this class was not fun.  Only reason I was able to pass was through self-teaching from the book.  The tests are rediculous, his notes and lectures go no where.  Only take him if you absolutely MUST.

    Although he gets sidetracked during his lectures, sometimes making easy problems seem impossible, all you have to do is study the review sheets for his tests because they are almost identical.  Overall good teacher, nice man-means well and wants his students to succeed.

    Professor Cohen is overall a good teacher. He does tend to get side tracked and he doesnt go over enough examples. I liked his notes because i felt that he was organized with them. He is very eager to help outside of class. If you're fairly good at math and do your homework you should be fine.

    Clearly definitely is his favorite word but nothing he says or writes on the board is clear.He's a nice person but a horrible horrible teacher.If you do decide to take his class, hire a tutor, or two.because you will be lost, guaranteed.p.s -I heard his wife is bad too, but better than him.

    He has an obsession with the word clearly though nothing is clear. This girl and I had a question on the hw so we went to his office and asked him. He gave us one answer, then another. In class someone else asked about the problem and he gave us a third answer. If he can’t get it how should we&#63;

    If you want to learn the material through class lectures and notes...DO NOT take this class! Very hard to understand, feels like he's all over the place. Not clear and unorganized. I had to learn the material on my own. But there's no hw and pretty good reviews before each test.

    Avoid him at all costs. I got a 5 on AP Calc AB and was lost in the class. He asks if we have questions, but he's eight steps aheard of you and you do not know where to begin.  If you ask a question, to expect it to be answered.  He is like a politicain when it come to questions, he dodges them.
