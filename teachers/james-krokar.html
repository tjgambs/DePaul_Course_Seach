He has his quirks, but is a laid back professor.  If you ask Krokar for help he will do his best to guide you.  Krokar defiantly helped me progress as a writer.  Come to class prepared and with a desire to learn and a class with Krokar will be a breeze.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2011<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Krokar is a good professor. His class on Sarajevo was very compelling and his grading was pretty fair. My advice is to be active in the discussions because they're 25% of your grade. Nevertheless, I'd recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2011<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty good professor and fair grader.

He's a smart man and pretty articulate. Take notes during his lectures, read your book, and you'll get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2008<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very funny guy. You can tell he really enjoys what he's teaching. Lectures can seem long but go to class and pay attention. Midterm and Final is mostly based on his lectures. Don't really have to read the book. Participation is crucial! As long as you show up to class and speak, you'll do well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2008<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor K Is a great guy I like him alot very clear make sure you come to class his passes around a sign in sheet. he also makes the mid term and final mostly off the lectures but be sure to read a few questions will pop up make sure to participate in the class disscusions but what a great guy i would love to take him agian if i get the chance an</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2008<br>Class Name: HIS216<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor!

An easy grader. If you attend class and say at least one thing you'll be ok. Plus there is a research paper. not hard and he grades easy. Take the class, he is cool guy too, not mean and laughs alot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Althoug this professor means well, he is very condescending.  He treats students as if he is better then them and shows obvious bitterness towards college students.  Thinks all students are slackers.  Easy grader, boring class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2007<br>Class Name: HST250<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i didnt pay attn to 1 word of his lectures and got a B. 4 absences is max or you fail. dont buy the reading books, get the text book. the MT & F are straight from the book (take home). book report due at end of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2007<br>Class Name: HST331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Put simply, Krokar is the man.  Good-humored, obsessed with his subject, easy grader, extremely receptive to student questions.  If you're a serious history student, you'll love him; if you're just taking one class, take him anyway because he'll try to keep it painless.  Probably the best the History Department has to offer.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2007<br>Class Name: HST330<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Krokar is my favorite professor at DePaul. He is so interesting and facilitates great discussions. You will learn a lot if you do the reading and participate. He makes corny jokes and tries hard not to laugh at them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: HST218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Krokar is hilarious, and yes he does look like mr. feeney from boy meets world. he offers help and even a re-write on papers in his class and the tests are not hard if you study. it's not the easiest class in the world, but it's definitely not hard. he truly enjoys teaching history and i enjoyed his class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/10/2006<br>Class Name: 199AND215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice guy and I learned a lot about Eastern Europe in his class.

If you need HST 199 take him.  You have 10 weeks to complete a BS research paper on a topic of your choosing. Midterms and Finals are take home.  Attendance and participation count for a heavy portion of your grade, however, just show up and make same lame comment now and then.
