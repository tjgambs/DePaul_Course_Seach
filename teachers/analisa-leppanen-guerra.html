Lectures were uninspiring or just awkward, the same discussion of Roma marginalization was reiterated each class, and the course was just overall poorly organized. I got so little out of this class, so I would not recommend it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: HAA130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Analisa is a fantastic professor and the reason that I became an art history major. She is really engaging and pretty hilarious at times. Best class I have taken. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2012<br>Class Name: HAA239<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I went into this class apprehensively as a freshman but caught onto her lessons quickly. She gives great background info and does her best to make sure everyone is on track. She lectures mostly, but if you show any interest she rewards you with cute personal anecdotes and references Disney! She has fun with her subject, and I'm taking her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2009<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor- only 3 tests, both impromptus and a final project. Extremely interesting class, final project a lot of work but really fun. Tough grader, picky about writing style, but would definitely reccommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: ARTHIST<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing prof! Wow! She is very helpful! If you show her that you care- she will go above and beyond to see you do well in the class! I am very happy i took her. Awesome prof!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2008<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She did not return assignments in time to have any feedback for the midterm/final. It really made the class difficult</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: ART239<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is wonderful if you are interested in the topic. If you wish to take an art history class to fulfill a requirement, take a general survey. This class is meant for people who have and interest in modern art and wish to learn more in depth about its origins, etc. Highly recommended for those who are actually invested in the material</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: ART239<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really well informed and smart teacher, definitely knows what she's talking about.  Makes you read every night, which sucks because you have to bring your book to class.  Seems more difficult than it is, not that bad of a grader.  Enjoyable class for anyone interested in art history, and no slide memorization, just 2 papers, midterm, and final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2008<br>Class Name: ART101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher ever! Her lectures are terrible and offer nothing as far as learning goes. Dont waste your money on this lady.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2008<br>Class Name: ART332<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's ok.  I did well in the class, but she grades assignments as if everyone is going for their doctorate in Modern Art.  Half of us weren't even Art Majors (but required to take the course for our majors)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2008<br>Class Name: ART242<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had no interest in modern art before her but her passion and enthusiasm for the subhect was totally contagious.  I love her, she is so sweet and truly cares about her students.  TAKE HER!!  you will not regret it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this professor is pretty good at the teaching portion, her finals are written out not like the typical art hist tests. however she is a very tough grader with writing, and she has extra readings called e- reserves which are a pain in the a-s-s and long but the material is also pretty dry enless your into art alot. but she expects too much on tests</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All she asks is that you follow the syllabus...midterm and final werent that hard, she gives you 4 topics to study and she picks two for the tests.  I hated art before this class...now i really enjoy it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2007<br>Class Name: ART239<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think the negative feedback must be stemming from people who were not invested enough in the class to work hard. Prof. Leppanen is a very thorough teacher, extremely invested in art history, who challenges her students. If you don't feel like working/getting anything out of your college education, her classes aren't for you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/03/2007<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I did not enjoy her class at all. Her lectures were always hard to understand and I felt I didn't get anything out of the course. She wasn't very helpful and didn't seem interested in the students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2007<br>Class Name: ART239<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I too am shocked about the negative feedback for this professor. Personally I got a great deal out of her class. Not only did she cover a wide range of artists and movements, she made the information understandable, interesting, and added humor to the various movements. It is obvious that this teacher holds a great interest/comand in this subject.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2007<br>Class Name: ART239<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am incredibly surprised at the negativity toward this teacher, not only is she easy going and flexible but she cares. When our class was swamped at the end of spring quarter she extended our final paper for us, simply because we asked. She is always open to meeting and talking one-on-one with her students if they need help or guidance. She is one</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2006<br>Class Name: ART238<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>classes are kind of boring. i found them interesting b/c i'm an art history major but she doesn't go through the art in the most fascinating manor. her mid-term is impossible b/c she doesn't allow any time to answer. very anal!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she used to be a english teacher so she makes you write well rounded essays that must include a strong thesis for your midterm and final. you only have about 10-15 minutes per essay and you get four of them for the midterm, not to mention you have to memorize about 70 art pieces. this class is seriously a waste of my money and time</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>absolutely terrible! the midterm was insanely hard and for the paper she wants you to write a 5 page formal analysis on a piece of lame art! how to you write 5 pages on a piece of lame art&#63;!!&#63; at least give us a art piece that has more things in it so there are more stuff to write about! NEVER EVER TAKE THIS CRAZY LADY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2006<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very unprofessional, comes unperpared at times and says &quot;um&quot; A LOT. All she does on a daily basis is show us art without telling us until 1 week before the midterm that you have to memorize the &quot;title, artist, creation date, & time period&quot; of about literally 50 pieces and literally write 4 strictly timed essays. She is VERY strict on attendance.</div></div></div></body></html>
