Language & Style was quite difficult, but Dr. Meyer does his best to accommodate all learning styles. If you don't do well in some of the exercises, there will be opportunities to redeem yourself. If he sees a true effort, you won't do poorly. Very helpful, funny, kind, and respectful of students' time and money. Highly enjoyed. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2015<br>Class Name: ENG375<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've had at DePaul. I learned an incredible amount, and really feel like he will continue to be a resource for me. Would highly recommend. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2015<br>Class Name: ENG407<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor explained grammar and style in ways that made the subjects easy to understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Take Professor Meyer if you're at least willing to participate in discussions. He has a ton of knowledge about film and literature, so it's worthwhile to speak up and contribute. His lectures are long, but the information is useful and interesting. I got to read some really great works and definitely benefitted from the class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2014<br>Class Name: ENG477<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found professor Meyer to be affable, patient, and yet demanding in his own way.  There are a lot of readings but very interesting ones, and he has a good way of leading discussions in a student-centered yet productive way.  His class, Language and Style for Writers, gave me more practical tools to inform my creative work than any workshop.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2013<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In 4 years of undergrad, I've never had this much homework. We work simultaneously on 4 or 5 movies/stories per week, so the material is kind of lost on the entire class - we can barely keep up when he's talking about one story before he switches to another! Nice guy, but needs to cut down the requirements...there's way too much to be manageable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2013<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Too much readings! Homework literally takes forever to complete. Don't take this class if you want to have a social life.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2011<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I found Dr. Meyer to be very pleasant and approachable.  The best compliment I can give is that if Professor Meyer is the instructor of any future ENG classes that I have to take, I will always choose the courses or sections he teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2007<br>Class Name: ENG272<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very knowledgeable professor of the class. He knows his stuff.  he's pretty cool. His quizzes are easy if you read the books, but he's a bit tough on the essay grading and his tests are kind of challenging, although he tells you exactly whats on the tests. I got a B on the class but i had to work pretty hard for it, especially an elective.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2006<br>Class Name: ENG270<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Meyer is interesting and a little quirky. He's a nice guy and he won't be too hard on you. He will pick texts that are interesting to him, which is good because then he really knows what he's talking about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2006<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>great teacher, easy, knows what he is talking about, good and fair grader  one of the best i had</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2006<br>Class Name: ENG220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>truly one of the sweestest professors ever. Very understanding. Class is very relaxed, he never makes class stressful.  A few papers, is a great fan of the digtal drop box,and the class is not hard. Keep up with readings and youll do fine. I def. reccomend him to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: ENGLISH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: ENG275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Meyer is a brilliant professor who asks that his students pay attention and read.  If you put effot into your papers and class comments, he'll hook up the grade.  The class was amazing, fun, and well taught</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2005<br>Class Name: ENG<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's incredibly nice. He doesn't assign tons of work and is very generous when it comes to grades. I've taken him a couple of times, and I haven't been disappointed, yet.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2005<br>Class Name: 400<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He has interesting stories and he is funny.  He is also a very sweet man if you have any questions.  I found him to be generous with grading.  He also gives out study guides.  He tells you exactly what is going to be on the tests.  If his class seems boring it's because grammar is boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2004<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Meyer is a horrible teacher.  He teaches his own method that you will never lose again.  He is also a cruel person.  I would never take another one of his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: ENG400<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Meyer is never prepared for class, gives students pointless worksheets, and goes off on extreme tangents. A horrible professor who goes through the book, page by page, exercise by exercise. While grammar isn't exciting, he makes it much worse.</div></div></div></body></html>
