Easily can get an A just DO the extra credit. Theres also a large group project that takes the whole quarter to do.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice teacher even though he doesn't smile a lot and lacks facial expressions. I'm doing good in the class and I didn't even buy the book.  You've got all the notes you need from the slides and the online book guide.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2004<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a nice prof. When you need help with the project, he is not that helpful. he wants to quote &quot;perpare u for the real world&quot; So he wont give you complete understandable answers. He reads off the sides.Gives alot of extra credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2004<br>Class Name: MIS340<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst class ever!  Professor read every word off of every slide and lectured for three hours straight only 10 minute break.  TWO time and work intensive group projects which didn't even seem to pertian to the course.  Got an A, but learned NOTHING!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
