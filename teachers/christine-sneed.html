Really knows her stuff. She gives great feedback on workshop stories and she not only teaches you about writing, but also about the industry, which is so important. All readings are interesting and I really feel I'm leaving this class a better writer. Would definitely recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2011<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Sneed, like almost all English profs, doesn't like to give A's and grades based on her own preferences. You need to read the stories assigned CAREFULLY in order to get A's on the quizzes. There are a lot of specific questions about locations, names, etc. so they can be tough. I was hoping for much better stories considering it was a lit class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2010<br>Class Name: ENG120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Sneed was extremely nice, helpful, and all around a great teacher. She likes to talk about the content a lot in her lectures so pay attention. There are 2 papers, 2 quizzes and a final. Also there are small 3-4 point quizzes after some stories. Overall this class wasn't too demanding. If you do the work and read you will get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2009<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy class! Professor Sneed is very nice, and is a good teacher. Attendance is mandatory, but as long as you come to class and aren't a complete moron, there is no reason why you shouldn't get at least an A-.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is an excellent class for all business majors. It really prepares you to right appropriately. Prof is a pretty tough grader tho. You can work really hard to get an A, but if you have typos 4get it you will get a B. She is pretty cool, do the work and you should be fine. She really grades with +/-. Won't just give you extra points.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2009<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a really nice teacher, fair but kinda hard grader. She just wants you to be prepared for the real business world. Do your best and you should have no problem getting an A. She allows you to correct 1 assignment for a better grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2008<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! She really cares about her students and wants you to do well. Most of the class is discussion based. If you participate in the discussions and put at least some effort into the papers, you will do very well. Again, great professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2008<br>Class Name: ENG100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice...'nuff said.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2008<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class.

We had discussions based on the readings in the textbooks, wrote papers and could revise all of them at the end of the quarter if we wanted to.

She goes on for ours and hours about absolutely nothing. All we did was talk about movies, told jokes, and talked alot alot about sex.. Pretty good class.. Make sure you attend every class :(. You use the book everyday. I never read it seems you can always relate to the stories topic in some way with out reading. Shes Good</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved this class, looked forward to it everyday.  She made the hour and a half fly by.  I would definitely recommend  her - very knowledgable and funny. :]  If you talk to her after missing an assignment, she'll usually accept it.

She's a real bright lady, take advantage of that. Also, she's a very clever writer, ask for articles and books she's written and she'll give them to you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice, helpful and easy teacher.  She prepares you for the job.  She answers all questions.  She is ready to help anytime. I definately recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: ENG202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took Professor Sneed for Professional Writing for Business. She is really nice and helpful. This class can be boring, but it is so easy and really helps you prepare job materials. You do your resume and cover letter and she offers good feedback. I recommend her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice and calm professor. Material is a bit boring.. we basically did the same thing the whole semester. She is a tough grader. B's are easy to get, but that A is just impossible. Class is fun if you just talk and get involved. Plus she gets involved and the time flies by. Good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady, but does pick favorites I happened to be one of them because I expressed feminist beliefs and talked a lot in class.  Doesn't want you to miss class and if she doesn't like you she will be a hard grader on your papers I noticed.  Take her for a pretty easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she was a good teacher. Tough to get A's on papers though.  We got to revise two papers for a final.  I really thought i was going to get and A, but managed a B+ and was really pissed, cause i think i deserved an A. But she is worth taking. Don't need to stress in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think Prof. Sneed is a good teacher with whom you can get along very well. The problem lies in the subject itself, it is boring. She does her best to make it interesting though, that is why I gave her a positive evaluation. I would take this class again with her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this teacher is mean and very scary looking.  she is not intelligent and thinks she knows more about things than she does</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>UNREASONABLE</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She sucks. She acts like she's a high school teacher.  She is a very picky teacher and she gets mad at the dumbest things like when your phone goes off.  She even kicked one kid out b/c his phone went off!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was one of the greatest English teachers I had so fa far in college.

I learned a lot more in Eng 102. She is very boring and she does not do a good job of making english fun.She has made the English Language a much more frustrating subject to have to deal with.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2003<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a nice lady but tends to play favorites.
