He was an excellent teacher. His classes were intellectually stimulating and the material was challenging. He refused to cater to the spoiled student who wanted an A without earning it. He asked his students to work, but he was always there for extra help. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2014<br>Class Name: MAT528<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>yes he is intelligent, but he is no a TEACHER.

His class is no cake walk.  Though his homework assignments are difficult, he gives students the opportunity to make corrections for full credit.  Expect to put in the time, but note that his teaching style is fair.</div></div></div></body></html>
