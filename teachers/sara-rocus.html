Definitely take her if you get the chance! She's young, fresh, and relatable she understands this isn't easy stuff and is there for you 100%. Have a question about your lab report or grade? Talk to her and she'll make time for you. Also, I took her at night from 6-9pm and highly recommend it! </div></div></div></body></html>
