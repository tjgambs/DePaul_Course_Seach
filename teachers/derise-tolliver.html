Although our time together was short due to my previous Mentor retiring and Dr. Tolliver being assigned to me, it was the best.  She's extremely thought provoking and inspiring.  Dr. Tolliver's feedback made me look at my future differently  and I'm totally inspired now to look beyond..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: SNC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love Dr Tolliver! I loved the subject, plus she made the class so interesting. The only class I never missed. She provides a plethora of information and tools to understand the subject. The insight and love she provided I will take with me forever.

She is absolutely brilliant, goes out of her way to make her class fun, very inspiring, genuine and cares about every student getting an A. It's not a blow off class, and there is readingwriting to do, but if you don't take a class from her at SNL, you are missing out. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: LL250705<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Tolliver was an inspiring professor!  I loved taking class with her.  I was not at all interested in the class before I took it, but she really challenged me and I ended up enjoying the class very much.  We always did a short meditation at the beginning of class which always set a nice tone for the session.</div></div></div></body></html>
