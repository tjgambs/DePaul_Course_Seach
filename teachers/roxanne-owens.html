The book hooks do not take that much time, she is a very easy grader on all other assignments.  You do not have to read the book to do well in this class.  The time with students was really easy because we only read books to students.  Professor Owens is very knowledgable in her field.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: EE347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes class fun by using many unique activities and lesson styles. She is a very fair grader and gives you chances to revise. For the final, you can make a children's book. We take two trips to a school to teach a lesson to groups of one of two students at a time. She is very friendly, compassionate, caring, and she loves her job. Great prof!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: EE347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is passionate and fun.
