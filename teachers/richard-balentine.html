Easy grader although claims he is not. Don't trust him on that. I would recommend this class, I really enjoyed it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2007<br>Class Name: CATH180<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sarcastic, which scared me at first, but overall..very NICE guy. He is new to DePaul, so didn't give a midterm or final..just quizzes EVERY week- which makes you attend class. LECTURE, LECTURE, LECTURE- take good notes, that is what he mostly test on. Definitely makes the class interesting!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2006<br>Class Name: ISP103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Funny guy!!
