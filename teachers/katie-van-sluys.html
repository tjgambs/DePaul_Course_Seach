This course requires a lot of work and pushes you out of your comfort zone, but you learn more than you could from any other professor. Dr. Van Sluys provides realistic, useful, activities that are invaluable to future teachers. She also takes a real interest in making sure that every student learns successfully!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2008<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher should be fired. Has class pets that she caters to. Has extremely high expectation which are not reasonable. Workload is immense of nonsense. Take class with someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2008<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with all of the comments below that this class is just plain useless. There is nothing that I learned in this class that I didn't already know from Emergent Literacy. Waste of $$$. It's a crime that this class is required & taught by this teacher. The teacher products lots and Lots of work. I did it to her specifications & still grades low.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/22/2008<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worked very hard on useless work that does not really apply to real-life classroom activities. Like everyone here says: lots of useless busywork. I regret taking this class with this teacher. She should not be teaching period.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/08/2008<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>horrible class. Tons and tons of useless busywork. I haven't learned very much. Terrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2008<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like to reflect on your reflections, this class is for you. It's not an intellectually challenging class, but you'll be doing ridiculous amounts of busy work! It's also surprising that someone who has so much trouble with the written word (at least in English) is teaching a reading class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/29/2008<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awful. just awful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor is lousy, She thinks VERY highly of herself.  WHY&#63;&#63; Required reading is huge.  Class is split between people who participate in observations at a local school on Thursday mornings. Those who don't are not treated the same.  Do not expect a A if you're not apart of this group. You work hard and still she grades you low. Take another class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2008<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>So much time for so little reward.  Very few readings discussed in class -- I regret buying the books.  LOTS of projects/group assignments that are not worth the effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2008<br>Class Name: TL413<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The amount of word is staggering..expections are ridiculously high. The teacher assigns so much work that don't expect to have a life outside this class...obviously she doesn't.  Assigns a writing project w/6 drafts..because she wants to see edits. Does she not think that Graduate students know how to write papers&#63;&#63;&#63;  Take this class w/another teac</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>WORST CLASS EVER! Assigns too much work that's redundant.  You can work hard and still get an ok grade. She doesn't explain assignments or care about you. She misses class but you can't. She's so vain she probably checks this and her students so paranoid she is that they post kind words like the 3 below. I doubt she read our finals. GET A LIFE LADY</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2008<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this class was incredible.  I learned so much from this wonderful professor.  She really knows her stuff and is very passionate about education.  she was very approachable and helpful with all of my questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2008<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Truly a first-rate teacher. As everyone has stated, there is a lot of work, but it is all useful. I have learned so much and wish that every class at DePaul was this beneficial.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2008<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful teacher.  There is a lot of reading but it is all interesting, easy to read, and useful.  She gives a lot of assignments but is very clear about them and you really learn a lot.  She is very intelligent and knowledgeable about education.  I would highly recommend her to anybody who truly has the desire to be an excellent educator.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2007<br>Class Name: TL591<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor can't explain any assignment to save her life.  She assigns irrelevant and overwhelming assignments and provides you with no direction/clarification to complete them.  She seems more interested in furthering her own needs and career than helping students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2006<br>Class Name: TL<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof. is difficult and demanding, but that is what I'm paying for!! She challenges her student's to think beyond their comfort zones and to push themselves to become better educators. She is knows her stuff and is an excellent resource for future teachers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2005<br>Class Name: TL<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOTS OF WORK</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2005<br>Class Name: TAUGHTWITHHER<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I taught with Katie Van Sluys and found that she is a very knowledgable and approachable person.  She loves her field and she loves to instill this love in others.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof. assigns an OVERWHELMING amount of work, most of which is totally irrelevant.  You will leave class every time with a splitting headache.  She is also very disorganized and cannot explain assignments/projects clearly. Definitely would not recommend. The only upside: she knows her stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2005<br>Class Name: EE326<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knows how to teach kids but definitely not adults.  Assigns huge group projects that are irrelevant to the class.  I think she's knowledgable, but she comes off as very narrow-minded and arrogant.  Would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2005<br>Class Name: TL412<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This prof is incredibly condescending.  I was so interested in the course before interacting with this disorganized and self-serving person.  She teaches with her own personal agendas in mind. She may be good with children, but has no clue how to teach adults or know how to interact with them.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2004<br>Class Name: EE326<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Upon seeing the syllabus, I was overwhelmed as this course is very involved and intense but I must say that the hard work pays off as the information you learn from this very knowledgeable professor is invaluable. It really is not that difficult to get a good grade either, you just have to work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2004<br>Class Name: EE326<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is inredibly neurotic. She teaches both grad and undergrad courses, but they both have the same syllabus, so it's VERY HARD. She assigns articles that SHE wrote, and she shows videos of herself working with children, which is almost scary. The kids seem a little scared.  A weird lady.</div></div></div></body></html>
