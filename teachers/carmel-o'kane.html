Strict, but personable and tries to keep the student engaged. The class is taught in 98% Spanish -- which was difficult, but if you read the book before class and practice, you'll do fine. Attendance, participation, preparation, homework, and website work are expected. Drops the lowest exam grade of five total exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2008<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does make everyone participate and she speaks in Spanish the whole time which is good if you actually want to learn the language.

Her teaching method is terrible.. you can't just lecture on Spanish and expect the students to learn it! There very little (almost none) conversation amongst students. I didn't learn anything! The tests were fair, but she needs to refine her teaching methods.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2008<br>Class Name: SPN103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she wasn't horrible, but it seems like she's new to teaching or something.  i know that all language classes at DePaul use the textbook like it's the bible, but she literally goes through every activity and asks every student in the class what their response is, which wastes too much time and gets quite annoying. she's also a pretty tough grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2008<br>Class Name: SPAN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2005<br>Class Name: SPAN106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very cool and funny...I really liked her and would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2004<br>Class Name: 106<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's great!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/17/2004<br>Class Name: SPANISH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very nice, great teacher and flexible, she does help students if you need it and is respectful of everyone, even when people are immature in class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: SPANSH105<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Huge lack of respect for students.
