This man should not be teaching anyone. I think he should be in a cube designing databases  as far away from people as possible. This man is not interested in teaching  is very unorganized and makes his students suffer because of his own laziness.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2007<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Anyone can read off of a set of PowerPoint slides  which is what he does. Makes no effort to teach students. Frankly, I may quit DePaul because of the experience. You are better off checking a book out from you local library and teaching yourself  your time would be better spent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2006<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very arrogant teacher that makes students feel like their retards for asking questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2006<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought he is the worst, but after thinking back to the class, he is not that bad. There alot of negative aspectsin his teaching methods. He is laways late to post grades for homeworks or finals. But Honestly, I tried e-mailing him, he responded back very fast, May be because I emailed him after 12:00 midnight.He is very irragont, not very bad</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Knowlegable but not very good professor in teaching materials</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2006<br>Class Name: DATABASEDESIGN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the worst prof I have ever had lazy, arrogant, lots of attitude and unclear.

I turned in homework 02/06/06, and received my grade 03/24/06. And this was &quot;homework&quot;.  He shows very little interest in his students. You never receive comments on your work..even when asked.  I would recommend to AVOID this teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: CSC451543<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with all your guys' comments- In the many years I've been at DePaul's CTI , I've never had such a bad teacher.  Truly LAZY, doesn't respond to most of your emails and when he does, it's too late.  His timing on grading was terrible- he didn't give us our homework or project grades back until after the quarter was over. ANd lastly, he is RUD</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: DBDESIGN<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A complete ass.  No organization, lazy, never corrects assignments on time, horrible grading system, and arrogant to boot.  Avoid if at all possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2006<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very bad</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2005<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is not the best teacher to take this class with. He will make your life harder than it's. Takes him forever to respond to your emails. You'll learn a lot about database design in this class. If you are an A student, expect a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2005<br>Class Name: HCI<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good teacher to speak to after the class with any questions.

I had him for the international class/trip in Prague. Didn't learn a thing, but who care; lots of fun and fun to get **** with. If this class is offered again, it's worth taking. You may learn a thing or too if you actually pay attention classwise and lifewise =P.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2005<br>Class Name: CSC351451<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Is happy to go over any questions.
