I wish i took the 10 week class to absorb more. He was nice, and insightful. the take home Mid-term and final are nuts. 13 pages for the midterm and 20 pages for the final. He's worth it but be ready to work. not a blow off class at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2012<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took race, conflict, and community for my explorer class with this professor and he acted like he did not want to be there, and cancelled class all the time. Extremely intelligent professor, just not personable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2012<br>Class Name: PSC321<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easily one of the best and most interesting political science teachers at DePaul. Class is basically self-taught with a nudge</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2012<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Thought I was going to fail this class because homework is 25% of your grade. I only did some of the homework, but scored really well on the midterm and final. Class requires lots of readying, and good writing skills for the essay exams. Good luck!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/21/2012<br>Class Name: PSC219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Deis is a really tough teacher, but ultimately he gives you the grade you deserve.  I learned a lot in his class.  He changed how I think about political science.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2012<br>Class Name: PSC219<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Teacher knew his stuff and made sure we were aware of it. Intelligent guy with great ideas but plays the race card a bit too often. Enjoyed the films but thought my tuition dollars would've been better spent elsewhere instead of sitting in a 3 hr class where 1.5 of those hours were spent watching a movie.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2012<br>Class Name: PSC321<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE this professor!!!! By far my favorite professor at DePaul I learned more in his class than any other class at DePaul.  I wish I could take him for every single one of my Political Science classes.  Keep doing your thing Chris! The students love you!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chris is an awesome teacher. He is so passionate about this class that it makes the class exciting. You want to be there for the discussions, even if you are one of those that hates participating. The readings are long, repetitive, and the response essays are tedious, but it's an easy class. Participate, get work done, and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2011<br>Class Name: PSC213<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While a very eloquent guy, I felt like he would have been more interesting to talk to at a bar instead of in a classroom setting. He gives good reading recommendations, but has a tendency to teach through youtube. He also has no problem with slipping in his political bias into class. He is, however, one of the more interesting professors @ Depaul</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2011<br>Class Name: PSC213<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Deis is really one of the best professors I've ever had. Class is run as a seminar/disc. Keeps class fun and interesting so nearly everyone is engaged. He is not a powerpoint/lecture teacher. You will learn a lot about yourself, aside from topics in political soc. His expectations are high, but you'll actually learn from him;Deis is top notch</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2011<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is every engaging in the sense that he allows the students to shape the conversation, however the amount of reading is not worth it. The midterm was impossible, and I read most of the required reading, I still didn't get a decent grade. Take this class, but you will have to work hard for your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Chris is definitely one of the best prof I have ever had. At the top echelon of prof at DePaul and probably elsewhere. Extremely engaging educator who subtly forces you to expand your thinking. Does what a prof is SUPPOSED to do and does it very well. not an easy class but college is not supposed to be easy. If u have a chance must take this class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2010<br>Class Name: PSC219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Deis is by far one of the most engaging teachers at Depaul University.  He has a passion for the subjects he teaches and it shows.  Class is set up more as a discussion and there is no use of slides which is a fantastic change.  A must take if you are interested in exploring ideas that you would otherwise never contemplate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2010<br>Class Name: PSC219<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Deis is extremely interesting, engaging, and his class is fun. I really enjoyed his Black Political Culture class and I hope to take him again while he's still at DePaul. He is a hard grader, but it's only because he expects the best from all his students. If you get a chance to take him, you should!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2010<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is one of the best teachers I've had in my life, he will challenge you and the class won't be easy, but will open your mind to things you probably never considered or at the least will force you to look at issues from a different point of view.  Take this teacher if given the opportunity, he is on an elite level at Depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2010<br>Class Name: PSC219<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div></div></div></div></body></html>
