Not really able to control class very well - put students in charge of most of the classroom duties.  I felt bad, he's a very very nice guy, but not the best professor.  Very easy class to get an A, but good luck learning accounting.  Warning: the class is group based (group project, group midterm/final).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A. Nicest person ever, but not a good teacher. The whole class was based on group work, even the Midterm & final were done in groups. He gave us starbuks giftcards, and took us out for food. You will have no clue of your standing till final week. I recommend him if you will teach yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2006<br>Class Name: ACC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The easiest A ever! If you want to do well in ACC 102, or just LEARN something, don't take him. I am struggling in 102 bc this class was a joke. Group project, midterm, final. You will learn nothing! He is sooo nice at heart (probably one of the nicest people on this Earth), but can't teach if his life depended on it.</div></div></div></body></html>
