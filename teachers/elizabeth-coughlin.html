She's so intelligent, she's a fantastic teacher (which is something not all professors are) and really helps you to understand what you're learning. She's so sweet and so dedicated, I'd love to take another class with her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2010<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is an amazing teacher. She was very helpful and was understanding with everything with everything. We had 5 assignments to do plus the two big project. They all are time consuming but she is willing to help if you need help. I loved her for everything she did.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2009<br>Class Name: WRD202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy teach. 5 assignments not to hard attendance is mandatory for a 1/2 qtr class. Nice lady helpful for class or other papers not related. Recommended you take her for wrd 202 it doesn't cost you anything for your 5th class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2008<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Like everyone else who's had her: it can be boring in class.  She can drone on and on.  I feel she is much more knowledgeable than most of the &quot;English&quot; professors I've had in the last 4 years.  She's a very fair grader.  She's helpful when you need it.  Assignments are easy, but sometimes time consuming to complete.  Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2008<br>Class Name: WRD204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>best prof i've ever had. she's so easy going and chill about everything and life.i would def take her again for a different class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: ENG206<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class itself is boring no matter which instructor you have.  Mrs. Coughlin is such a sweet lady and always willing to help.  I'd take her again, she's very dedicated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/20/2005<br>Class Name: ENG301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh - my - ****!!!! This class is SO BORRRINNGGG!! I'm sitting in it right now, that's how bored i am! everyone's sleeping and she won't shut up. It's just too boring, too much common sense chat. If you feel like sitting and doing nothing, take this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2005<br>Class Name: ENG120READLIT<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher, she is willing to help clear things up.

The classes can be boring but if your into reading literature and especially POETRY (she does mostly poetry) then it should be a great class. Not a hard grader but more fair grader than most teachers so a honest effort is needed for papers and tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice and helpful person.  If you do the work, you are going to get a good grade.  The only drawback is that class is VERY boring, because she rambles.  The class would be better if she would devote more time to hands-on work instead of lecture</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENG204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy A, Great teacher too. If you hate english and you are a CTI major.. take her.. she knows CTI students cant write.</div></div></div></body></html>
