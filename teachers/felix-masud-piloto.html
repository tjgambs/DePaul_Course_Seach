Aside from that, he was terrible. He was the worst professor I have ever had, and was incredibly mean to some students. He has the attention span of a goldfish. I learned from reading the assigned books but being in the class was useless. Strongly recommend looking elsewhere. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/17/2012<br>Class Name: HIST314<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>knowledgeable but disorganized and never can keep to a particular itinerary or thought. plays favorites.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2011<br>Class Name: HST204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very knowledgeable of the material, but doesn't teach whats on the exams. We watched really great movies and had loads of reading to do in the text book. But he never fully discussed what we read in the assigned readings with the class which got frustrating when preparing for the exams, which are graded pretty tough. He mumbles when talking.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/19/2010<br>Class Name: HST204<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher. Average amount of reading. You MUST do the reading or you will do poorly on the exams. Group project was really easy. If you take the class as a joke to just sit around and watch movies you will do very poorly. Do the readings and you will do fine</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2009<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Masud-Piloto loves his subject, but he is unclear about his expectations most of the time.  Do the papers for the movies and try to do reading or at least become knowledgeable about the discussion subject and you should be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2009<br>Class Name: LST306<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a disaster!! He was gone 2 of the 10 and assigned a 15 page 9 people group project just to keep us busy! on the last day of class we had to turn in about 25 pages! there was so much busy work and so many pointless papers. This was NOT an easy A!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2009<br>Class Name: LST306<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His course requirements are unclear, throws a 9 person group project in the middle of the quarter, drills you after you presented...poor folks. then ion the final day of class, we had another group project due, 4 article papers, a movie response paper and a analysis of the overall relevance and value of the course</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2007<br>Class Name: HST314<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you come to class, pay attention, and do the work you will do well in class. Professor Masud does not grade you based upon your race.  I received an A twice, don’t speak Spanish, and didn’t have to work that hard to achieve it. The trick is to take good and detailed notes because the test is based off the lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2007<br>Class Name: HON102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He definitely knows his stuff, but his class was really dull and boring. It was discussion of readings and some videos. Not very engaging, but I still came out of the class knowing more about (and being more interested in) Latin American history.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2006<br>Class Name: HST314<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>knows cuban history, great speaker, loved the class... however grading is somewhere between arbitrary and race based.  If you happen to be a native spanish speaker, an a is easy to acheive, otherwise you better work harder than ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2006<br>Class Name: HST311<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures every class and entire grade is on one paper and test at end of quarter.  Doesn't get very in depth into any part of history, it was like a high school history class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2006<br>Class Name: HST311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of my favorite teachers to take for a 300 hundred level class. He has a great deal of knowledge about the subject that he teaches. He assigns a group research paper, and helps you along the way. If you need to take a 300 hundred level history class, you have to take his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: HST306<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He uses teaching tools other than just lecture. IF you participate in class-bring in articles, you'll do fine. If you fool around in class, he'll know and call you out.  Do the homework, don't make excuses about the community service, do a few papers, gives u opportunity for xtra credit, u'll do FINE! He cares about his class and is easy 2 talk to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2006<br>Class Name: LST306<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is has a HOT Temper. He is not organized at all. Gets faustrated when students don't participate. But very easy class. No attendence required. No Books or Test. Just 25hr of community service and (1)group paper/presentation. That's all. I have to say that prof. is knowledgable. just not motivated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: HST314<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is fairly easy, a couple film responses, a research paper and a final. Mostly lecture and 5 films. Not the most enthralling lectures, but Prof. Masud-Piloto is very knowledgable on the subject and I learned a lot. Very nice guy, lets out early for night class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/09/2006<br>Class Name: LST306<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he likes to call people out in class if you're not paying attention cuz its sooo boring.  if you're just sitting there not saying anything he will pick on you and try to embarrass you in class.  he's not a good professor at all.  DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: HSTLATINO<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Professor, easy, but boring class. If you have a night class, he lets you out early! Just do the work and you will do fine. I would love to take him again if i had the chance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2005<br>Class Name: HST203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great class, Great Teacher, good teaching style, learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2005<br>Class Name: HST203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Proffessor Piloto is an excellent man!!! He is very clear, kind hearted and always lets you out early:) I was not interested at all in the course material when I signed up for this class but now I love this class and it is because of him and his teaching style.  I would definately take this proffessor again if I could.  Keep up the good work!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2005<br>Class Name: LST201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Somewhat heavy reading but interesting.  He has alot of experience and thus is able to speak first hand on much of the material.  If I had a chance I would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2004<br>Class Name: LST201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Masud is very informative and likes to talk a lot, but in this he does make things very clear and makes the text easier to understand. Go to class, take notes (for tests), do the reaction papers, and you should be ok.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2004<br>Class Name: ISP220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice fellow, very interesting and knowledgeble. Too much reading for my taste, but it's reasonable. Likes Cuba too much! Overall ok professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2004<br>Class Name: HST314<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice guy. LONG lectures can get boring at times BUT NOTES are important for Midterm and FINAL! HIGHLY intelligent man... He knows his history. I would take him again if I could. Challenging but rewarding!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2004<br>Class Name: HST314<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is GREAT, very knowledgable men!  He is really nice, his classes have lot's of info. about Cuba.  His classes are lecture and participation.  Adequate amount of work, very COOL professor, head of Latino Research Dept.
