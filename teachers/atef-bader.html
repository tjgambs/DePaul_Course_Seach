The course was all about learning topics from a 2003 textbook, half of which isn't relevant anymore.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: IS485<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is a joke. There were 2 books required for this class.  On the syllabus he lists out topics he will cover throughout the course but doesn't mention which books we should read or what chapters to read. There was no feedback given for the homework assignments so you don't know if you're on the right track when u take the midtermfinal.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2014<br>Class Name: SE352<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very slow and boring lectures, barely teaches anything through the duration of the class except follow web tutorials made in 2003. Would not recommend, however he seems to be the only one to teach these classes. The class isn't too hard, just alot of boring tedious work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2014<br>Class Name: IS375<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Interest in class feigned after the first lecture. He makes the students reiterate everything he says. It's a learning process for some but I felt babied. Has a total of 3 assignments, midterm and final are assignments that are posted online for exactly 4 hours so should keep track of when the due date is for that.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2008<br>Class Name: SE430<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very knowlegeable individual with a good grasp on the course. He does need to spend a little more time on explaining the concepts with the real world examples. Overall he is excellent.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2007<br>Class Name: SE554<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For an EJB class he and the book fail to provide a complete example of how to connect two entities with a relationship that also needed to store information. Final was assinine--involved hand writing 5-7 java classes with 8-14 getters/setters each (300-500 lines of code by hand). AVOID AT ALL COSTS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2007<br>Class Name: SE554<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really liked his style of teaching. Goes to the very depth, and is patient to answer all your questions, till you are satisfied. On getting started he has this  serious look on his face, but he is very much approachable. Had been extremely fair withe grading and homeworks demands that you understand his lecture and material. I definitely recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: SE701<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he knows what he is saying! make everything just like a piece of cake!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2006<br>Class Name: SE554<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard tests.
