When I took it (Spring 2015) it was pretty much entirely an excel class. He is crystal clear with assignments and explanations and you will use what you've learned for a LONG time in your professional career. Take it, it's important and USEFUL! It is also not hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2013<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you like stats, you'll like this class. If you hate stats, don't worry you can still get a good grade with minimal effort. HW and quizzes each week online, midterm, and final project. He's a really nice guy and is extremely helpful for the project. Midterm was tough, but easy grader and huge curve.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2012<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>helpful, knowledgeable, clear/concise, doesnt get any better then this when it comes to a class you will enjoy because of a great teacher....TAKE HIM!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2012<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The first half is difficult considering the midterm(he admits its hard). Everything you need is on the powerpoints and through lectures. Homeworks are all on excel with online quizzes.  Just do the homework, the quizzes and you're guaranteed a B if you do well on either the midterm or project. Do the project with him in class & don't put it off!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2012<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No book for this course. Professor was very clear in teaching. Online quizzes. 3 attempts. Easy. Midterm: open book. Challenging, but not impossible. This class is straight forward. He is a caring professor and tries to add some humor. I would take him again if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2010<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He replied to all emails...hard class, but Prof. White makes it pretty hard for you to fail.  Midterm was the hardest part and its curved.  Seriously you would have to try extremely hard to do bad in this class.  You get 3 attempts at each quiz, HW is easy.  Lectures are somewhat confusing until you do the homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2010<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took during summer.Textbook was $90, but optional. Class is optional, butI highly encouraged if you want to pass. Homework all done on excel, grades for effort so 100% is easy to get. For summer we had 4 quizzes and one written mdterm and 1 final. Both exams were very hard, but curved. The subjectmatterisverytheoretical, lotsofstudyingoutsideofclas</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2010<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is among the WORST professors at DePaul. But since he is the only one teaching this course, you have no choice.Do not buy the book. Midterm & final were extremely difficult (no proj. in the summer). I got a B, but did not learn anything. So, if you do the homework and quizzes, you will pass this class even if you failed the midterm.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2010<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I TOOK THIS OVER THE SUMMER. HE'S IS NOT GOOD PROFESSOR. DOESN'T REPLY TO EMAILS. THE HOMEWORK ARE DONE ON EXCEL, BUT EXAMS ARE HAND DONE. I WOULD RECOMMEND TAKING THIS CLASS IF YOU JUST FINISHED/TOOK STATS. HE CURVES MID-TERM AND FINAL. TRY TO DO THE HOMEWORK--YOU GET FULL CREDIT FOR MAKING AN ATTEMPT.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2010<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great guy and does everything in your favor. I disagree with those of you who say that attendance is not needed, as a matter of fact he does the HW in class the day before it's due, so then you won't have a hard time doing it. One midterm, which he curves and a final project which once again he does in class before it's due. He is great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2009<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's the only teacher so you have no real choice, but fyi. Medium Dificulty open-note midterm. DON'T GO TO CLASS, it's pointless. Gets notes from online. Only turn up for Lab Hours and you can do your Main project extremely easily. Easy class in general.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2009<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very unfair and boring as hell never ever explained anything, just read off the sidles which I can at home. There is no need to pay this to teach me fin202. Very hard midterm and there is no other teacher than him.  He is so not a professor.  Just reads and that is it.  Very boring teacher and harsh grader on  project.about 75% people had no idea</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really boring class. He can get boring at times as well. He's a fair grader.BEWARE: He says he randomly checks homework, and a lot of students got busted for turning in things other than homework, at the end of the quarter. Do not jeopardize your academics. Do the homework even if you're not sure how to do it he'll give you credit for trying</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2008<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice guy. A bit confusing at times and because of the quick pace of the class, he zips through the material so you have to stay on top of ur things!! Hands out free points a lot, fair grader, and also throws in points to help ur grade!! overall, really nice guy, but just keep up!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2008<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Let's just be clear on the fact that he's the only professor you can take for FIN 202. He stresses your learning on analysis and interpretation of the work you do, not just repeating the formulas you worked on in other math courses. Hands out easy points if you do your homework. Open note midterm and one final portfolio project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2008<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Prof</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/27/2008<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>you have weekly quizes that you get one shot on, hw is graded by completion, midterm and final project. class was easy but other than teaching material he is confusing and does not clarify specifics for the project he also takes a while to answer emails and grade things. but hes a nice teacher and curves most things. if you put in the effort youll</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/26/2008<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mr. white is a really nice person; however, the class is stupid and unnecessary. Since you do not have to a choice for this class, you are screwed; however, this is an easy A. Take the quizzes as many times as necessary to get perfect score. They really make a difference in the end. In other words, do not miss out on easy points.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2008<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE IS YOUR ONLY OPTION FOR 202</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2008<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor.

The midterm was VERY difficult, despite being open-note, but he curves it a lot.  Professor White does a great job explaining it, and the class will really improve your Excel skills.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice guy.  He lets you know what everything in a clear way.  Not confusing in his teaching.  Even if your not so great in your past related classes you can actually learn here.  Good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2008<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't need text, easy online weekly quizzes & HW, super easy project which can finish in if keep up in labs, study for the midterm even though open note.

He understands that you have more classes than just his. However, to get a good grade keep up with all the homework and quizzes. I got a B+ and didn't study for the midterm. There is no final just a big project that he goes over, for the most part at least.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2007<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is cool. Can't really complain. The project was very interesting, I only wished he knew how to explain it better. The homework is easy (online) mid-term is difficult, but he gives a big curve. Take Him. Easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/27/2007<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an easy professor. The quizes are easy and so is the homework. Keep up with his teaching and you will get a good grade even if you don't do well on the midterm or the final project.  The final project is not hard but he grades it hard.  I would definitely recomend him, he is not the most interesting professor to listen but he knows his stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Your grade is based on homework, online quizzes, a midterm(half of which is online), and a project. Do not put off the project until the end of the quarter. Also, be sure to study for the in class part of the midterm. Other then that, the class is pretty easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you are planning to take the CFA exam after college, read the text, listen to his lectures, and do all of the homework. CFA exam questions are written and similar to his quiz questions. Dont fall behind on the assignments or miss too many lectures, it will only make the final project harder.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/06/2007<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think he's a decent teacher,the only problem is how this class is set up.If you're a fin major, this should NOT be 2 credit class since it's too important of a topic.Also, a terrible choice of book for this level-CFA text.Midterm was hard, but he applied a HUGE curve.He offered lots of help for the final project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2007<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the class is FAST! but just do all your work, homework, and the final project.  The quizzes are every class period but he goes over them before he give them so just pay attention!  Also, the test is 25% curved as it was in our class.  Overall, its an EASY A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Material is pretty difficult, but he's a really nice grader.

Easy A.  He is a nice guy and tries to help everyone.  Some people ****ed too much about the final project.  It just took some work and he took a lot of his own time to help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2006<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is the biggest waste of money.  Since its a requirement, and he is the only teacher, we're stuck with him.  Whatever you do, dont buy the textbook... and go to the group sessions for the final project.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2006<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>What else can I say besides you have to take this to graduate&#63; Final project takes a long time to do...take a laptop to class and work on it during lecture when you can. Weekly quizzes are relatively easy. Test 1 was pretty easy but test two is next to impossible. Rest easy though, crazy curves. Dont slack or this class will cause a lot of stress.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2006<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Its an extremly fast paced class.  Only class to give a 3hr presentation is sometimes less than 1hr and a half.  Its pretty easy to pass, just take the quiz, attempt the hw, do the project, and review the slides for the mid and final.  He curved our classes final by 25%.  If you really pay attention you'll master excel.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2005<br>Class Name: FIN202<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Okay one of the hardest yet easiest A's ive ever gotten - the material is SO HARD and there is SO MUCH of it - but, get the midterm and final and project from someone else (which white says he encourages) and youll be fine - everything is based off the previous stuff - hopefully you know someone if you dont, make friends!
