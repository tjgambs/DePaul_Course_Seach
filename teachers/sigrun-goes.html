If you have to take a course she teaches expect to translate what she teaches. I tried going to the tutors and even they can't translate her lectures/examples. No need for textbook, she doesn't use it.

She lacks organization, loses tests, forgets the homework problems that she assigned, and did not put an effort into class participation. She is very unclear and often confuses herself. She even gave us the wrong final time! If she's still teaching, DO NOT TAKE HER!

The only thing u will use her for is to hand you a test every friday. She is older than the world. No typed tests. No tests back before the final. No help in teaching me math.

However the class is truly unbearable. I tried to pay attention in the beginning of the class but literally cannot focus on her. I think 10% of what she says could help me but the other 90% of is just soo boring that I dont pay attention at all. I learned absolutely nothing. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2008<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was 15+ minutes late to every class. Her tests are impossible to read as they are hand written. She takes the entire hour to go through 1 problem. Assigns problems we never talked about. Exams cover nothing of what you've done in class. She lost exams, never gave back homework/notes. She was AWFUL! Not exaggerating.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2008<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very sweet lady but very hard to understand. I had to teach myself in the class. I dont no wat ppl r talking abt retaking tests as many times as we can...just 3 tests and a final and we had to beg her to let us redo one test. Alloted extra time for us to finish tests.

She lost at least one of everybody's tests, no-joke. She is completely disogranized just look at her office. Our class started a petition against her she was so bad. I hate to say this but I really think she is too old and has lost her mind. Everything I learned in that whole class, I did within the first week of BMS 125. Horrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2008<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is nice, helpful, and understanding, but she is simply too old to be teaching anymore. She speaks very softly and is extremely unorganized. I got an A in the class, but that's because I sat in the front row and had to teach myself. For the benefit of the majority, she really must retire.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2008<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just terrible.  Couldn't understand a word she said.  Someone could drop a bomb in the back of the class and she probably wouldn't notice.  She didn't react to anything anyone ever did - crossword puzzles, newspaper, walking out in the middle of class. Terrible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2008<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is like your typical math class you don't learn anything in class, and then go home and teach it to yourself. Prof Goes has a very thick accent and does not speak very loudly. You better sit in the first 2 rows if you want to hear anything she says. It is hard to understand her. I am good at math so I was able to teach myself. Good Luck</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2007<br>Class Name: WRC204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the witch from Snow White and the seven dwarfs, but she is very sweet and understanding.  She rambles on about the same problem for an entire class period.  The class is easy, but boring as all hell.

Homework is from the book and she allows you to make-up test you have missed or failed. She encourages to ask for help and to meet with her if you have questions. She speaks softly and has an accent. If you want to pass and hear the lesson sit it in the front row.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2007<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love how nice she is...she is so understanding and teaches very democratically. I would take any of her classes even though she can be very forgetful. I would recommend reminding her often. Other than that she is great! And I dont learn math easily! She's the only one who can teach me and it makes sense!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2007<br>Class Name: MAT131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS ANY CLASSES FROM THIS TEACHER!!! You will find yourself lost without the book. Her very delicate and heavily accented voice and chicken scratch writing will make you do all the work on your own. You have to teach yourself everything. Another awful depaul math teacher!

Yeah, you do have to teach urself on the hw but she is veryy helpful. you can make up tests as many times as u want and there is no midterm. juss be sure to turn in all the hw..she does take daily attendance which can kind of affect ur grade if u never show up.
