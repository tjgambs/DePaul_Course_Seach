Also, no textbook!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2015<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>From the first day I met EP, I knew I was going to adore him and the class!

He's a mad genius with a unique sense of humor and I'm not bothered by the fact that he wears the same Paul shirt every day. It's part of who he is and I am so grateful that I was in his class. He definitely pushes you to reach your full potential and it's hard but you'll get SO much out of it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2013<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Plattner is one of them most memorable at DePaul.

From the first day you can tell that he's going to challenge you on everything. It might be a pain in the ass the first week or two but it pays off big time. I'd say it's a given that you'll be a better writer after the class. He's extremely helpful, a cool guy and doesn't require textbooks (saves tons of $)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Certainly a teacher to take if you wish to actually learn something meaningful and worthwhile. It's a very enjoyable class, and I'd love to take another, but I don't think he teaches more after this one. Agree that he is intimidating at first, but very entertaining. I looked forward to going to class.
