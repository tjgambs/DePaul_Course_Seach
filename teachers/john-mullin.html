    Moon was a great professor! He has an extremely easy class, always let us out early, and as long as you got your articles to him by the deadline and knew some of the basics of journalism writing, it was an easy A.

    Probably one of the best teachers I've had at Depaul. He's very laid back, and he's good at what he does and he teaches it well. I don't think we ever really had to use the book and the work was really easy.

    i think he's gone, but he was terrible. He thinks he is famous or something and likes to pay attention to the girls.
