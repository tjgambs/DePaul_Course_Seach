Doesn't teach at all!! Had his lawyer friend teach most of our lectures while he sat there. No HW review and TA grades it with no chance to correct it. Final is cummulative and he doesn't even tell you whats going to be on it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree fully with the last comment.  To add to it, the teacher has the TA post the grades on blackboard but admits to the class that they are not entered correctly.       He has no idea what our grades are until he talks to the TA which he promissed for 3 weeks he was going to do.  He doesn't go over homework problems nor does he them back.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a joke. He cannot teach whatsoever and his class is run by a TA. When asked to do PV problems, he says &quot;I really don't know how to do this myself&quot;. What DePaul FIN prof CANT do PV problems&#63; He finally &quot;tried&quot; one and came up with a wrong answer, I explained the bad news to him. Final is cumulative, 600 pgs of material, NO tips-Run AWAY!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/30/2005<br>Class Name: FIN350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ok, first off 350 is suppose to be hard. But if this guy teaches again. TAKE HIM! He isn't even a teacher he is a real estate agent. Super easy A. 1 MT,1 Final and the urbanplan. He's a great funny guy, and knows a**** load about real estate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: FINANCE350<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Show up, do your homework and put some effort into the project and you should have no problem getting an A in this class.</div></div></div></body></html>
