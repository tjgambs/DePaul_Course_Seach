    Do not take a class from Tresser. The material should be interesting, but he does a good job keeping it mundane. Many, many busy work assignments - 3 long papers, 3 presentations, 2 short papers and a weekly homework assignment for a 10 week class. He schedules the class really tight and we almost always run over. Skip it.

    I'm sure he has good intentions, but Tresser is not a good teacher.  Some people are made to act and some to teach, and he should act.  Don't take his classes.  He's self-absorbed, the material is dull when it doesn't have to be, and the projects are lame.

    He's obviously passionate and knowledgeable about what he teaches and very creative. My major complaint is receiving NO feedback during the course, then left to do a TON of work at end w/out guidance. He has a lot of potential, but should guide and empower students, rather than lecture hypercritically or cut students off mid-sentence.

    This was Tresser's first time teaching the course, so we all cut him some slack for a few scheduling glitches (papers &amp; presentations due same day). He loves what he does, we loved learning how to stop being apathetic Gen X-ers and get involved. Class is worth taking, its a 101 on how to do something about politics that you're not cool with.

    Tom has a passion for this subject.  I loved the way he creatively combined his theater background with the organizing aspects of cultural activism.  Every week he featured an artist, showed a film and played music to stress the different viewpoints on activism.  One drawback was planning two final assignments at the same time.

    Although the initial subject matter was interesting, the class itself was very superficial, disorganized and poorly planned out.  I learned very little, and the teacher did not give adequate feedback.
