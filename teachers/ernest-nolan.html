But if you are not a theatre student you will feel left out. He also gets irritated if you arent a die hard fan of what hes teaching which is annoying.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2011<br>Class Name: THE201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ernie is the greatest! He is hilarious and just exudes joy the moment you see him. He seriously knows what he's talking about and is always willing to chat. He is an incredible educator and if you listen and do a little work you can learn a lot from him. I absolutely loved his class and am taking another one from him next quarter!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2011<br>Class Name: THE268<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved Ernie's class! It was a required class for me and it was so much fun. Ernie makes class fun adn interesting and balances discussion with reading work. Such a great teacher and artist.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: THE341<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such an amazing human being, educator, artists. I've been fortunate to take several classes and work with him in productions. He is one of the most dedicated people I've met. He truly makes class fun, but will be the first to push you to your full potential. More professors at The Theatre School could and should follow his lead.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2011<br>Class Name: THE341<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is my second class with Ernie and I've just registered for a 3rd. Words cannot explain how much I love this man and his classes just keep getting better and better. He is one of the most passionate teachers ever which is probably in large part due to the fact that for the most part he hand designs his own courses. Every class is pure magic.</div></div></div></body></html>
