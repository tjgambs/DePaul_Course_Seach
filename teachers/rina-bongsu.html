    This class was fairly easy. I ended up with an A, however, the course material is so irrelevant to your internship and the 'real world.' Can I say... &quot;Lets get real!&quot;

    I took this class online. The reading material was helpful and interesting. She answered most emails within 24 hours. Her directions are relatively simple, but she will answer any questions you have. You have to write a paper and make a portfolio which is actually kind of interesting. I would def. suggest her! Easy A if you keep up with the work!

    Class seemed very easy in the beginning.  You do basic discussions and some papers.  However, all the fun comes at THE END WHEN YOU HAVE NO CLUE HOW YOU GOT A GRADE YOU GOT.  Do not take her.

    READ the directions very carefully. Alot of work but it is easy. She sends alot of emails and if you dont read them all, you may miss something important. Easy A if you can follow directions!!!

    Easy A! I took the online intership ISP 250 course. Rina's class is easy and cares alot about it. Its an online class all you have todo is answer &amp; reply to the discussion questions on time, few assingments. Cakewalk!
