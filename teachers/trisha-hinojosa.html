    She is a great teacher. Try and get her! She explains things well and she is also fun. She really enjoys teaching and it shows! I'm sooo glad I got her for stats because I actually enjoyed going to class and taking tests. Also, all quizzes &amp; tests are open note/open book! Big plus!

    She's a wonderful professor. Keeps lectures simple and tried to make them interesting, even though a lot of people may not find cognitive psychology that interesting.

    Trisha is very easy to understand, gives open book tests, and excellent notes. I recommend taking this class with her especially if you are going to grad school .(Take it from me, first year grad student currently in advanced stats)

    Trisha is a awesome. Makes power point slides and gives open book/open notes tests and quizzes. She gives a few unannounced quizzes (although she drops your TWO lowest quiz grades). Take no other stats class.

    She did a good job teaching a hard class (Stats II), and she's not even a Ph.D. yet. A little boring at times, but not too difficult. I recommend her over many other DePaul professors I've had.
