I have found myself consistently mirroring my own teaching style after his.  The day he had to leave class for the quarter due to health concerns  was so sad; the entire class was in tears.  Amazing, vintage man.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/30/2012<br>Class Name: TL000<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had Prof. Gabriel for a couple of classes and loved them both. A thoughtful, intelligent, caring teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2011<br>Class Name: SEC326<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Take his class. Any class he is teaching, take it, because he is brilliant. You will learn so much and be intellectually stimulated. Hilarious, creative, caring, and interesting. Way more than a teacher; facilitator of knowledge and passion.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2009<br>Class Name: TL426<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolute sweetheart! Class is fun. TONS of reading and writing but its all interesting, useful and directly applicable to your own classroom. One of my fave classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2009<br>Class Name: EDU426<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting, learned a lot, I am taking the time to do this because he was one of the best profs in Ed. and the class was very thought-provoking</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: TL428<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A really helpful professor with the best intentions. He is kind as well as interesting. The downside to his class is a lot of worthless reading that most of the time is not discussed in class. He is a bit unclear at times about his standards, but he does offer a lot of insight into the art of teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2008<br>Class Name: TL428<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Gabriel is a true gentleman and scholar.  He encourages his students to be brilliant both in his class and in their future classrooms.  He opened my eyes up to great new ways to teach.  I had a great time in every class which I am sure not many students can say about other profs.  BTW, love the other comment about Dumbledore: SO TRUE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2008<br>Class Name: TL428<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the BEST professor that I have ever had. I feel so helped and supported in my journey of becoming a teacher.  He is a great discussion facilitator, and also provides great modeling techniques of teaching.  He is extremely practical.  Also, the articles he gives out and textbooks he uses are also amazing.  I will be using almost all of it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2008<br>Class Name: TL428<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr.Gabriel is AWESOME.  He is the only professor I have ever had in which I never look at the clock.  Everything he teaches is important and I will use my notes and books for years to come.  TAKE HIS CLASS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2007<br>Class Name: TL426<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best Professor Ever. Reminds me of Dumbledore in temrs of insight, passion and beard. Most knowledge of anyone in the program. 30+ years of experience in suburban and inner city junior high and high schools. It is a lot of work, but in a good way. You feel fulfilled and excited to teach. You're an idiot if you dont take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2007<br>Class Name: TL611<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of reading, not very clear on what is expected of you in terms of papers, but overall, he provides a lot of insight into the profession to prepare you for this career.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/01/2007<br>Class Name: TL611<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome!
