He assigns tons of readings which in my opinion, don't teach much. I wouldn't take his course again. Nothing against Ron. I think he makes a good attempt but I didn't learn as much as I expected to. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: MPS588<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Ron is one of the best in SPS.  He is not an easy grader, but that is part of what makes him such a good  professor.  I learned more from his feedback than any other prof in the program, especially about writing and research.  He is open to questions, so don't be afraid to ask.  I had two classes with Ron, and wish I could have taken more.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: MPS500<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard grader. Assignment instructions are not clear. Class is boring. I've already decided that I will not take his classes anymore. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2014<br>Class Name: MPS501<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He cracks himself up ALL the time. He will pick on you if you don't participate, which is my biggest issue as I like to listen more than talk. Hard grader. Assignments are unclear and he'll explain them after you've turned them in. I've already decided that I will do anything possible not to take his classes anymore.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2014<br>Class Name: MPS501<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not an easy class and has high expectations but is helpful.  Make sure you don't write like a 3 year old :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: MPS501<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a challenging course. Ron made it pretty interesting. He is a great instructor. Not easy though. You will have to work for his classes. He is very helpful though-if you ask him assistance he will tell you anything you want to know.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2014<br>Class Name: MPS500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best MPS profs.  I have taken 1 of his classes online and 1 in the classroom.  He is a hard but fair grader.  His feedback was constructive--I am a much better writer for having taken his course.  He was helpful and always willing to answer questions after class, by phone or email.  The course was engaging, especially for being online!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2013<br>Class Name: MPS500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took his class online.  He does a good job of keeping everyone engaged with the material in an online class.  He isn't an easy grader, but I am a better writer after taking this class.  His comments were always constructive and helpful.  I learned a great deal!  A great intro to the MPS program.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2013<br>Class Name: DC402801<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun guy. Likeable. He has a "insider" perspective on film that makes his classes smart and interesting. I would definitely recommend his classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2012<br>Class Name: MPS500<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He does expect alot! He is good with his teaching style and does great with explaining things in class. He lacks in clarity about what he expects in the assignmes and will tell you after you turn it in. He also is not good with feedback in general when you see him outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: MPS500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent professor!  The course is well organized and his expectations are clear.  He does an excellent job of teaching online courses as well. He is a tough but fair grader.  Do the reading and proofread your assignments and you will be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/11/2009<br>Class Name: MPS500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVED Ron's classes (500 and 501) - he was my favorite prof in the program.  His grading is hard, but fair.  Do your work, participate in conversations and you'll do fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2009<br>Class Name: MPS500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A hard grader, but very helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2009<br>Class Name: MPS501<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BO-RING!  He expects A-LOT, eventhough this program is geared towards people already working in the &quot;real-world.&quot;  He actually made me reconsider my decision to attend this program.  Hand-holder, but in a non-helpful, almost disdainful way.  Came off as a bit patronising and rude at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2008<br>Class Name: MPS501<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had alot of expectation going in, but after taking his class I probably won't be taking it him again. Nothing against him personally, but he expects alot which is fine but it was difficult asking him questions because he lacked patience and was on a hand full of occasions rude to students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2007<br>Class Name: MPS515<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes finance not so intimidating. Great professor, do your reading, do the assignments, and you'll do well and learn a lot of helpful material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2006<br>Class Name: MPS500<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Fernandes is a great teacher.  He keeps night class very interesting with a sense of humor.  Gets his points across very well.  Some assignments are vague and his grading is pretty tough, but also very fair.  And he is available for outside help.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2005<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the coolest teacher! Very likeable person and has a great sense of humor. I learned alot from his class. He makes the subject very interesting.  A great teacher! I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2004<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very pleasant guy. Knows and likes what he is talking about. The class is pretty much common sense, but you learn alot of practical applications using statistics, excel, and power point.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2004<br>Class Name: QUANREAS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easygoing, Likeable guy.  If it ends up that youre in the 3 hr class, no big deal- you'll get out early all the time.  The class itself is more opinon in a sense, and he respects that.  I am learning quite a bit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/16/2004<br>Class Name: ISP<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very nice and funny man. I only had this class once a week thus there was a ton of information being presented at each class- This made the class rather difficult for me..but as far as his teaching goes i do recomend him!</div></div></div></body></html>
