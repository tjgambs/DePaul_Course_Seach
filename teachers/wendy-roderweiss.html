There is a power point for each assignment that looks like an infant put it together the morning before preschool. Assignments- A few poorly written fill in the blanks-example (What is the theme of Silence of the Lambs?) and some short answer questions that she doesn't read.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2014<br>Class Name: DC222<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>There's only five assignments. One of which is a paper. The other are quizzes. The class does require work and time. But it's not hard. Just a lot of memorization and understanding what you're memorizing. Take it. You get to watch movies every week!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2013<br>Class Name: VARIOUSDC<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wendy is AMAZING! She's always happy and encourages everyone to have fun, because she believes that cinema is all about doing what you love. She puts a smile on my face and makes me laugh, and she is overall a great person! She brings so much energy to her craft and is an inspiration to anyone lucky enough to be in her presence. Take her classes!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2013<br>Class Name: DC275<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Wendy was an awesome teacher!  She was incredibly helpful, passionate about the subject, and incredibly well organized.  Half the class lecturing, half the class hands on.  10/10, would take this class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2012<br>Class Name: DC113<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVED this class! Definitely recommend. Took it because it was online and filled an arts & lit requirement but I ended up really loving the class and the professor. Incredibly clear, fair, and helpful. Take this class!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2011<br>Class Name: DC201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher! She really knows and loves film and screenwriting and works well with students. First you learn how to write a screenplay and then you write a screenplay. There is a little reading and work to learn concepts but not very difficult. Definitely recommended!!</div></div></div></body></html>
