Overall, cool guy, good professor.  I do not think depaul should be intercrossing REL with a MGMT class.  I think they are mutually exclusive!  His tests were easy and you could tell he came from money no matter how hard he tried to deny it STILL A GOOD TEACHER</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/29/2004<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome guy. Really look forward to his class. Grades tests a little harshly, but he gives u all the questions that will be on it. Awesome sense of humor. Leaving for Baltimore next year unfortunetly.

However, the papers are somewhat hard. The tests are based on study questions, he assigns ech week.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Would not reccomend.

He will teach you a lot, if you are open to learn. The papers are kind of hard, but good professor over all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2004<br>Class Name: REL201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is an ok professor, believes in his ideas very strongly- there are 2 short papers (3-4) and a research paper (8-10), class presentation and a final which is pretty easy- can be boring though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2004<br>Class Name: REL201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy assignments, really nice guy, he's extremely helpful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting guy with a decent sense of humor.  He's also a huge sci-fi / fantasy nerd, so if you can interject something about LotR or the Matrix...by all means, go for it.  He's pretty stuck on his own ideas, but he's pretty fair overall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2004<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>you just sit there listening to him talking about HIS ideas, all others are forbidden.

I think he told us about &quot;the mother looking over her children knowing that's the last time they'll sleep in their beds&quot; story about 20 times!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2003<br>Class Name: MGT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked the class when it started because it was about religion and work, but as soon as it started talking about economics, I would fall asleep in class.  Other than that, the teacher is cool, funny and very interesting when he speaks about his family.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2003<br>Class Name: RELMGT228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so yeah, if he didnt take role, i probably never would have shown up. i probably couldve missed a week of class and he'd still be goin off on the same subject. pretty cool guy though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2003<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is a piece of work.  Shoulda been a politician.  Unclear, doesn't follow through with much of what he says (ie. returning papers)but is passionate about his own opinions and not much else.  Wouldn't suggest him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2003<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>As a teacher he is excellent. However, when he gets wrapped up in his own personal political agenda watch out cuz he's a huge jerk...and if you disagree with him....no matter how hard you work....he gives you B's....but give him a chance you could like hi</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2003<br>Class Name: REL228<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2003<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pettit is one of the easiest going guys I have met.
