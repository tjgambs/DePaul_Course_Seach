    She knows philosophy very well, and is very well read. Overall she is very boring. If you want to take her be prepared to write a lot. Every class she expects a one page glossary and questions. Every other week she expects a four page paper. There  is a final five page paper. She grades these writings as if we are all philosophers.

    This professor is really interesting. She makes you challenge your beliefs yet respects your thoughts. Tons of readings, but very helpful if you ask.

    She has to be one of the most boring teachers ever. Hard to connect with on any level and doesn't make class interesting. She is very helpful when you ask for it, but will put you to sleep. Oh and there is no textbook but be ready to print 60+ pages.

    This was one of those classes that you never forget. AMAZING professor that makes you challenge your beliefs. This is not an easy A, you need to participate in discussions and attend class because lecture notes help A LOT with exam questions WHICH SHE GIVES YOU prior to midterm and final so i don't understand why idiots say she is difficult?

    A lot of HW(reflections), a few quizzes &amp; 2 tests. You will learn since you re-read the readings over &amp; over. The readings range from a few pages to 30 but its covered over several classes. Class discussion is interesting. Test are not hard if you read the materials and ask questions in class.

    One of the worst teachers at DePaul. Her teaching methods are very old school. She doesn?t allow laptops/ipads in class, and her papers and assignments are all hand written. She gives WAY WAY too much homework, and makes you re-read the same long articles over and over. Tests are nearly impossible and she's a strict grader. DO NOT TAKE HER.

    She seems nice but if you are looking for a good Business Ethics class, this is not it. She assigns WAY TOO MUCH WORK and is a VERY HARD GRADER. Take it with another prof if you have to.

    She appears to be very intimating at first but she is just very educated on her subject.  As you talk with her more, you realize that she is very friendly and helpful.  She is not a windy old prof. She told us she went to a Lady Gaga costume party one weekend! Just participate and you will do fine.

    I dreaded this class at first but changed my mind quickly. She is extremely nice and helpful. As long as you do the reading and participate (in class or discussion board) you'll do fine. Her papers seem daunting but as long as you validate your reasons you'll get an A. She really made me appreciate philosophy. Take her if you have a chance.

    Dilek is brilliant.  She not only is a great professor, but she exudes intelligence.  You do not need to buy any books for the class, rather she has you print things.  One time she even had class outside and it was a nice change.  She seems intimidating the first day but everyone agrees that she grows on you after each class. Send her your papers!

    Do the readings and pay attention in class and you'll do fine! Dilek goes over everything so many times that even difficult concepts are easy to understand. She's also very nice... always asks how everyone's weekend was. :)

    This class was pretty interesting.  Dilek (she has you call her by her first name) was a good professor.  As long as you talk in class everyday and attend you will get an A.  Midterm is easy but doesnt count for much-it is all about participation.  She has 2 papers (one is the final) I got Bs on them but an A in the class cause of participation

    I tried to like her, but I just couldnt. Her lectures were disorganized, and she lets people comment for over half the class period with mundane opinions that are just repeating what another person said, as though she doesnt want to hurt any feelings. I understand its only PHL 100, so very basic, but I felt I learned nothing at all. Waste of time.

    Dilek is a very enthousiastic teacher! She gives very thorough notes and makes class fun by including random stories and fun facts. We didn't use a book, but she had us print out 8 different essays (kinda long). She is a tough grader, but overall a good teacher. I would recomment taking her for philosophy! :)

    Dilek is a really great professor. She is very strict on her rules (attendance, paper format, grammar, etc.) but she is very clear.  Only ONE paper and weekly quizzes.  Midterm and final were short answer questions. Participation was worth the same amount of points as the midterm so if you're quiet, learn to speak up or rethink taking this class.

    Professor Dilek is probably one of the best college professors I ever had. She is extremely straightforward. Just write notes from all the lectures and you are golden. I thought this class would be difficult because I'm not into philosophy but I was VERY pleased with my grades. She is how every college professor should be.

    Awesome professor! Pros: No textbook, she's very knowledgeable and passionate, and the work is EASY! Cons: Honestly... None.  She's a really nice person, helpful professor and her class made me want to change my major! Take her if you can.  Don't know what other people are talking about on here... probably too lazy to do any work!

    terrible professor, nice person. knows her stuff, but can't teach. she lets all of the idiots comment redundantly but when asked a question she talks for 10 min saying nothing. claims to be very picky about format of written answers... stressful. this class = the most wasted and mind numbing 3 hours of my week. and i actually LOVE philosophy!

    dilek's philosophy class is crosslisted as a management class and, to my enjoyment, covers both business and philosophical aspects very well. she really knows her stuff, no bs'ing around.. not afraid to have her point be heard. loved this class, would take her again!! she's cute too

    Great professor, even better person.  Gives lots of notes, but they will be useful for papers.  No final, just a paper.  Midterm is two questions she gives you to study before hand.  Explains everything you need to know.  Cares what her students think.  Always willing to explain more to help her students.  GREAT PROFESSOR... TAKE HER IF YOU CAN!!!!

    Good prof. I liked the discussion based class format where I could hold the class hostage to my beliefs through filibuster style talking points. The midterm and final were tough. I received a D or something on the midterm, maybe slightly better on the final, attended class every time, and worked my a$$ off on the project and got an A- in the class.

    She's an honest person with no **** and she doesn't mind saying it. The readings are dense but she will always explain and help when needed. There's an option of paper and mid-term exam but most people prefer to write papers. she critiques the papers well and gives good feedback. The class is easy and fun if you participate and read.

    She is a wonderful professor who genuinely cares how you do in the class. I can't stand philosophy, and have a hard time understanding it, but still ended up with an A. She's a little tough on papers, but i feel as though it's still fair, plus you can re-write any terrible ones. 2 pager, 3 pager, 5-6 page final essay, nothing too terrible

    Dilek is very passionate in what she teaches. this class really opened my mind to alternative ways of thinking. she is understanding and knows how to get the point across to a room full of sleep deprived college students. i hope she continues teaching.
