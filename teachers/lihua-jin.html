Incredibly intelligent, extremely entertaining, and very fair.  Don't expect a cakewalk, but put in the time and effort, and you will earn a grade probably matching your GPA.  Lectures are fast-paced so do not skip class and consider recording lectures.  Tests involve deeper understanding and not rote memorization, which I love.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2012<br>Class Name: CHE340<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Jin is a great professor. The exams can be difficult, but as long as you really know the learning objectives you will be fine. This class was intense; every Thursday is either a quiz or exam, so you have to study every day. She is helpful during office hours, so go! This class isn't as hard as you think as long as you put in the effort.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2012<br>Class Name: CHE342<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this teacher! she is hilarious and so helpful.Always takes the time out of her day when a student needs it. Even though her class is rigorous I would suggest studying her learning objectives and writing them over and over to get a good grade. That's what I did and it worked out fine for me. Be prepared to study a lot...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2012<br>Class Name: CHE342<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is amazing...shes super smart and fair on her grading..she even makes me laugh when she doesn't mean to. I would definitely take a class with this instructor again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2011<br>Class Name: CHE340<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wouldn't even buy the textbook. Besides 3 homework questions I never opened it. It's a really tough class. Exams have about 3 pages of fill in the blank and then short answer. The fill in the blank could be confusing. She curves everything to an 80% average. Extremely nice and approachable but class goes at a turbo pace so you better keep up!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2011<br>Class Name: CHE340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Jin is a great professor.  She is smart, kind, and seems to care about her students.  You can't expect for a better professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2010<br>Class Name: CHE113<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Thick accent, extremely hard to follow, and stragiht out of the textbook. Chemistry is hard, but this makes it unbearable. She means well and has opportinities to bring your grade up, but together its less that 2% (and you have to do about 25 things to get the maximum points) Entire class is concepts, no time is spent actually PRACTICING PROBLEMS.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2010<br>Class Name: CHE111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>CHE 111 is terrible.. do not expect an A out of this class unless you have an extensive chemistry background but somehow failed to test out of general chem.. that being said, Dr. Jin has a lot of great qualities as a teacher. She's fair &really tries to help her students. she does a decent job covering all the topics required for CHE 111, like 7/da</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2009<br>Class Name: CHE340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Jin is amazing. Biochem is really hard, but she makes it bearable. She will drop whatever she is doing to help her students, and she actually cares about them. She even postponed a quiz to allow us more time to study... she said she didnt care about tests or grades as much as she just wanted us to learn. You could not ask for a better teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/25/2008<br>Class Name: CHEM340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an awesome professor. She knows how to explain the material so everyone can understand it. Whenever a student goes to her office, she stops her work and helps the student (even though at that time she doesn't have office hours). She is very dedicated to her job.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2007<br>Class Name: CHE340<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>awesome teacher! she is the nicest teacher ever, but don't let it fool you. Biochem is a hard course but she tries to make it as understandable as possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: CHEM102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very nice, but does not make the subject understandable. The book does a better job explaining the subject than she does. Also, sometimes her tests are hard to follow.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very clear about what she wants, but the way she teachs somewhat muddies the waters. she's clearly very smart, but has a hard time dumbing it down for non science majors. she can be endearing, but dont take chem in general if you dont have to its harder than you think.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2006<br>Class Name: BIOCHEM<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>how can u take biochem as an easy class to fill an elective and then complain. it is not supposed to be an easy class. Dr. Jin is the best chem teacher ive ever had she makes her expectations very clear and her exams reflect homework assg.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: CHM102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you want an easy class to fill a credit do not take this class.  the way she teaches just confuses you more than actually teaching you something.  assignments are easy, but shes kinda a hard grader on exams and quizzes.  you'd be better off teaching yourself from the book</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: BIOCHEMISTRY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Jin is clearly articulates the goals of the course and what is expected of students who have ample opportunities to improve their grades through homework assignments and quizzes.  Professor Jin's lectures are well-prepared and gave me confidence in a subject I never thought I could do well in. Professor Jin is available outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: BIOCHEMISTRY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Definetely the best chemistry teacher at depaul. I abo****ely hated chemistry until i took her class. The class is hard but she is extremely helpful and always open for questions. I read other rating and I hate when lazy people blame teachers for their own laziness!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2005<br>Class Name: BIOCHEM<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She did try to fit a lot into the time allowed. However, what was on the test was emphasized in lecture. (I did find it funny that the quizzes were almost as long as the exams).</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2005<br>Class Name: CHE240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is horribly disorganized and she makes so many mistakes on tests. The questions are too specific, and the quizzes are too long like a regular test. She tried to fit in way too much stuff in one class. Her disorganization made this class unbearable.</div></div></div></body></html>
