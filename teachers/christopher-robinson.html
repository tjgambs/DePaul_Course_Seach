The posts below aren't lying-its week 9 & so far the only grade we've gotten back is on the midterm but he does grade easy. He said the worst he gives is a C. Attendance sheet, so don't skip. He's very nice!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2015<br>Class Name: REL220<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rev. Robinson definitely knows what he is talking about and is a great resource for religion. However, he did not grade one assignment the whole quarter or give any feedback. He told everyone they received A's on the midterm and I turned in all of my assignments, so I expected an A. However, my grade was lower than expected. His grading is unclear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2015<br>Class Name: REL221<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Fr. Robinson is a nice guy, but NOT a good professor.. His lectures are tHE longest lectures I have ever sat through and I felt like we were constantly building a foundation for something that we BARELY discussed in class. He also is terrible about posting grades and I received absolutely NO feedback on my work. Nice guy, but I wouldn't take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2015<br>Class Name: REL221<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Robinson was a really nice person, but a terrible professor... He did not give us ANY grades until week 9 when the quarter was almost over, and then provided absolutely zero feedback to our work... I was looking forward to his class but was thoroughly dissapointed with the content and complete lack of feedback. Class was a perpetual build up...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2015<br>Class Name: REL230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Fr.

We learned more about the history of religions instead of debating about anything.  He lectures for the full hour and a half, and is tough about attendance and participation.  I suggest taking only if you are ready to do work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2014<br>Class Name: REL212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wonderful man, cares about students a lot. Gives out A's consistently to the class. Did not find the material very interesting. He will embarrass you if you text/talk or type in class by calling you out. Sign in sheet daily- don't skip class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/20/2006<br>Class Name: CTH325<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fr. Chris is hands down the best professor I've had at DePaul. I've taken a number of classes with him and all of them were great. He's not necessarily the easiest professor but if you do the reading and show up for class you'll have 0 problems. His classes are always interesting & he's always willing to help students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/14/2006<br>Class Name: BUSINESSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Father Chris has become one of my favorite professors at Depaul.  He's super liberal, which I love, and very open minded. The class is easy if you show up and do the work.

He is funny, makes the 3hr night class go by like that. A lot of reading assignments, but you really don't need to do them all. He goes over everything you need to know for the quizes in class. Get involved & make comments in class; he likes to see that. Take him if you can, it will be worth it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: BUSINESSETHICS<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Father Chris is two words: Absolutely Amazing! Take him if you can! He's soooo funny and nice. I loved him and his class! He makes class interesting and explains the material using real life examples.

He's dedicated to his students, and really wants you to learn the material. There's a lot of reading in this class, but it's worthwhile during the discussions.

He really wants you to do well and understand the material.  He plays devil's advoctae on many issues which helps liven up class discussions.  He ended up giving us full credit for 3-4 quizzez out of 10 for various reasons.  He is very fair and reasonable.  Overall a great guy who'll be glad to lend a hand in the future.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: REL<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't think I have ever had more fun in a religion class.

The class is not for those trying to fill the religion requirement and he makes that very clear from the beginning.  This is the best class I've taken so far and it's because of Robinson.
