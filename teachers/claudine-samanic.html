    By far the worst professor I've ever had. Supposed to be fundamentals but felt like advanced physics. Terrible teaching methods, hard exams, long lectures. I did my homework, paid attention in class and still had a hard time. Avoid at all cost. Worse academic decision I ever took was take this class with her.
