He lectures in class, but uses the book for test questions - so come prepared! Great class and a fun time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. If you put in the work and try, you will get a lot out of the class. Meet with him during office hours--he is more than just a teacher. Great advisor for the soc department.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2013<br>Class Name: SOC101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very cool professor. I highly recommend him for content, however there is a LOT of content. Be in class. Always. Take good notes and READ THE BOOK. His tests aren't hard if you follow the syllabus. Easy B. Makes you write an "ESJ" every week. Basically a journal where you say anything you want but relate it to class. Be committed to this course.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/27/2012<br>Class Name: SOC384<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome! I don't think I've ever worked with a teacher with as much knowledge about the sociology and film fields as he does. He can be rigid and may come off as intimidating to some people, but in the end I value the experience I gained from his class. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2009<br>Class Name: SOC390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an awesome professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2009<br>Class Name: SOC2389<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is an amazing professor. Truly you will learn so much from him. He is funny, hot, and brilliant. He swears and shares his life experiences with his students, which are really interesting to listen to. If your sick of taking the same boring professors at DePaul take him! He is amazing!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/17/2008<br>Class Name: SOC384<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OK- no matter what you think of him, you do get the grade that you think you deserve.  He lets you pick your grade, and as long as you justify it and he agrees, what you pick is what you get.  So do your work, show up, and stop complaining.  If you work hard, it'll pay off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/11/2008<br>Class Name: SOC373<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In one sentence: &quot;tries too hard to be cool&quot; sums it up. I think we were supposed to be impressed my his tattoes and  that he hung out with drug users. The class felt all about him and his experiences and less about the stuff we read. The topic was very interesting though if you are interested in public health because there are some good readings.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/25/2008<br>Class Name: SOC438<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far the BEST teacher I've ever had. Required attendance but VERY interesting classes. A book a week, but best-selling and interesting books. Makes you think. Makes you argue with your own beliefs. You won't come out of his classes the way you went in. Taking a class with his is like a life experience, you just have to do it to know. TAKE HIM!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2008<br>Class Name: SOC390<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I will most likely never experience a class or professor of this magnitude ever again in my education career. His brilliance is unavoidable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2007<br>Class Name: SOCA<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he changed my life for the better.  in the top two best teachers ive ever had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>you have never enjoyed a class the way you will end up appreciating one of his</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2007<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think Greg is absolutely great!

There was a book a week, but if he likes you, you can get away without turning them in, I only did a couple of the book reviews and I got an A. Interesting class and professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/05/2006<br>Class Name: SOC373<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2006<br>Class Name: SOC307<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I have ever had by far!  He never responds to your emails.  He is an extremely hard grader too.  He missed three of our night classes which is fine, but he still expected you to hand in your hw even though he wasn't there.  Most of the hw you had was never even discussed during class.  You couldn't pay me to take his class again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: STREETGANGS<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>interesting class, amazing teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: ISP102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This man is more ego than knowledge.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/11/2005<br>Class Name: GANGINCHI<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably the best class I've ever taken.

Yes he might like to hear himself talk, and he might be a tough grader, and a little unclear on stuff, but he is pretty funny.  First half of his street gangs class is boring as can be though.  Skip the first 4 weeks.
