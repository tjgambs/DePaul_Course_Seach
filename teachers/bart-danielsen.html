    Overall a decent person. Probably one of the worst teachers I've ever had the opportunity to take.  I'm sure he knows his stuff but he doesn't transfer his knowledge to students very well.

    He is a good guy, but simply does not know how to teach. Class is more than boring (especially when you have it in the morning). Grades are based on homework, midterm, final, and several small EC assignments. He stumbles in solving problems, and is very unclear. I didn't get much out of this class. I wouldn't take him unless I had no other choice.

    This guy takes himself too seriously...  Took him last year and was a bit of a jerk.  Not very helpful in general, but then again, the class he taught was retarded.

    Good guy, but not a great teacher.  Often did not have the answers to the questions asked in class.

    The class is hard to describe.  I worked harder in this class than in most, but I wouldn't call it a hard class.  If you put in the effort, you can expect a good grade.  We had 2 required group reports and a take-home essay final.  Class discussions count a lot, and they were really high quality.

    A good teacher, class was heavily based upon discussion.  Class participation was 40% of the grade, and there were only 1 Group Case and a final exam.  Fairly easy class, if you can be vocal in the class.  Fun part, the teacher has a southern accent.
