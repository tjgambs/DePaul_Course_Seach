CampusConnect lists her as &quot;W Robinson&quot; which is the way I got stuck in this class. Although attendance is not required and her exams are super easy this class is not worth it. If you're looking to actually learn something about psychology take this class with any other professor. She comes to class late (when she does show up)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2011<br>Class Name: PSY352<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I cannot believe I'm actually still in this class! It's a waste of time and I'm only taking it because everything else was closed. Stay away from this class because you really won't learn anything, her class cooperation level is at it's lowest. No fun at all just really boring and dry. The TA did a much better job than she did.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2011<br>Class Name: PSYCH346<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i never read once and maybe read through the study guide for the midterm. no final exam only paper and presentation. easy A, but honestly a waste of time. She was always late and made her TA do all the work. Take her if you want an easy A, but I'm worning you that you will not learn anything from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2011<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS! she is awful. im not learning anything and it's pointless! please do yourself a favor and take another class by another professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/20/2011<br>Class Name: PSY363<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this woman is AWFUL! she could be a nice and interesting prof but she isnt. she cares more about herself and her education than actually teaching the class. class is EXTREMELY BORING and she just brags about her degree and personal experiences. DO NOT TAKE LAVOME she sucks. im not learning anything!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2011<br>Class Name: PSY346<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Robinson is interesting&#63; She comes to class late and we had a guest speaker almost every class period. As long as you do your discussion board postings and pay attention you will easily ace the class! More than half of the class got a perfect on the midterm.

Sits at the back of the class & texts on her blackberry during student or guest lectures. Lack of feedback and delayed postings of grades. She likes to talk about her Interventions & personal experiences over African American Psychology. This teacher earned 10 year and is disengaged</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2009<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is soo cynical about things! I don't think she got into med school for future psychiatry work and probably went to an easy school for her Ph.D because everyone thinks she is a dimwit... Anyways, go to class, read the notes, ace the exam...Easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2008<br>Class Name: PSYCH334<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great disappointment.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2008<br>Class Name: PSYABN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not that bad.  A bit crazy and disorganized.  On the other hand she is funny if you keep an open mind. Not nearly as mean as people say. Interesting life experience.

She turned interesting material to boring pop culture vomit. She puts down students' opinions and makes statements expecting you to be amazed at her intelligence. Only grades include 2 exams and weekly blackboard discussions. She uses Oprah as a educational resource.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2008<br>Class Name: ABPSY<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's not bad, she is a little weird but very interesting.  The discussion boards and grade curve made this class an EASY A.  She was bad at communicating w/ the TA, and the course got off schedule often. Be prepared for lots of Oprah.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2007<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Robinson is rude to her students, and does not know how to answer questions professionally. She does not create a very friendly learning environment.She makes too many references to Oprah, and doesn't spend enough time on the actual material. Take this class at your own risk.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2007<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This course should be re-titled &quot;All About How LaVome Got A Ph.D., How Impressed You Should Be (make that shocked!),  What She Watches on TV, and How She Can't Be Bothered With the Likes of YOU.&quot;  Truly inspiring.  Show up and sleep.

LaVome is unfamiliar with the material she &quot;teaches&quot; and unable to discuss it intelligently, which is why she intimidates those who ask questions and tends to show videos and read to the class from textbooks.  She's unprofessional and just plain nasty to people.  I'm ashamed that she's on DePaul's faculty.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/10/2006<br>Class Name: PSY353<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is horrible!  These ratings are accurate!  She changed the class to 3 tests, but its still your whole grade!  If you have questions you have to go to the T.A., even if you just want to know your grade on a test.  You never get to see the grade!  AVOID HER! WORST TEACHER EVER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2006<br>Class Name: ABNORMAL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this class.  I read these reviews and still decided to take it, and it was a very bad decision.  She cannot teach at all!  And she is of no help.

Sure, she talks a lot about her PhD degree, but she should...that's an accomplishment.  Your grade is based on only one Midterm and one final, but both are multiple choice.  She also gives you extra credit for just coming to class (you can miss up to 3 classes and get full credit)!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: ABNORMALPSYCH<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Always late with a fresh cup of Starbucks.

She has a PhD but can't even pronounce hippocrates or Niche, yet if you feel like watching three or four Oprah shows and One Flew Over The CooCoo's Nest, take this class. Just show up every day for extra credit, take notes, don't read, and get an easy A!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: ABNORMAL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Three words...

I would have to agree with everyone elses' comments.  She cared about talking at us from the text and then bored us by talking about her research project which really had nothing to do with this course.  Not to mention she was 15 min late every day prancing in with her Starbucks.  Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2004<br>Class Name: ABNRMLPSYC<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Bad, bad, bad professor!
