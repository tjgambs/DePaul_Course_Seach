    She gets easily intimidated by guys, especially non-voice majors.  And sometimes the crap she says about technique is complete garbage (vowel shape especially!!!). But she's very nice and easy to work with if you're a girl and a vocalist.

    She doesn't teach choir anymore, she's just the accompanist and occasionally does woman's sectionals. She's obviously a great musician and a really sweet lady, but she doesn't really have the authority needed to direct a choir. She's ok with the women, but the men pay no attention to her at all.

    Has NO idea how to direct a choir.  Does not belong in this field of music.  Most likely a wondeful solo teacher for piano/voice, but is clueless in terms of the choral ensemble.  Disgrace.
