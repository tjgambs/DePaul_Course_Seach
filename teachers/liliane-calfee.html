Before I took her class, to be honest I was just going for the credit because it's required for my major. But she made the lecture really interesting and the class relates to real life really well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/13/2015<br>Class Name: DC105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class because it was a free elective I had open & didn't expect to love it as much as I did.
