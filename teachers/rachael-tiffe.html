She's an activist, but won't try to convince you to change your beliefs. Had a lot of great discussion in her class and would recommend her to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2009<br>Class Name: CMN103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice. She's an anarchist and it comes off in her lectures (good & bad). The PowerPoints are not self explanatory and don't focus on what will be on the exam. She is pretty. DO NOT DO THE SERVICE OPTION? more work and less educational than group project. We had an oversharing student in the class and Tiffe didn't moderate the student very well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2008<br>Class Name: CMN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor.
