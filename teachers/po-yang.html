    In the classes I've had her, she presents the material clearly, gives examples and does an excellent job of conveying the material we are supposed to learn. Her quizzes and exams are straight-forward extensions of the homework. Her drawback is she doesn't field questions asked during lecture well. Otherwise, she's great!

    Quizes everyweek plus a final.  The homework is ungraded.  The questions were oriented more towards application than theory.  She moved a fairly rapid pace.

    This was the first class she taught at DePaul.  It is mandatory for grad students in math and all sections seem to follow the same syllabus.  Her quizes/test are straightforward, neither hard nor easy.  Her only real weakness is her accent, which is thick but understandable.
