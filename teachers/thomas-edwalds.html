    Does not water anything down, but compensates w open-note exams. Questions are basically the math questions in your notes anyway. His method is effective if its important to you that you get a thorough education in risk management. Tips: bring calculator &amp; print notes for class, try to be engaged, stay onahead of pace &amp; lectures will be bearable.

    He is a really nice professor, although He can be boring. Two midterms, one final. As long as you get the concept right, but numbers wrong, he'll give you credit for it. He curves big time. He assigns homework, but never collects it. I didn't open the book at all.

    Lectures are very boring and he goes almost 3 hours each lecture.  He assigns weekly homework and will give you extra credit if you go up to the board and discuss a problem.  Midterm and Final both worth 50%each.  Exams are very lengthy, but you get to use open notes and books. Understand the homework  and examples in book and you will do well.
