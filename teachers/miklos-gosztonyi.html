He is really nice but very, very boring. Every week you'll have around 200+ pages of reading and he will give you impossible quizzes on them. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2015<br>Class Name: PAX240<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a good-hearted guy and a decent teacher. At least for PAX 240, there is a disproportionate amount of pages to read for the weekly reading quizzes, a ratio somewhere around 30-50 pages total of reading for a 5 question quiz.  I have struggled with completing these assignments - this learning style just isn't for me</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2015<br>Class Name: PAX2<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>excellent professor. great ideas, great reading suggestions. the other reviews below must have been looking for an easy A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2015<br>Class Name: HUMANRIGHTS<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Miklos is very knowledgable, but most of the time class was very boring. There was a ridiculous amount of reading assigned every week. There was also almost no student engagement- just us staring at him as he spoke. Probably wouldn't recommend, though I did learn some interesting stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2015<br>Class Name: PAXCPL240<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the most cultured people I have ever met. He knew what he was talking about. I felt like he listened to me when I spoke. Reading is really important for this class - if you've read, you'll understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/02/2015<br>Class Name: PAXCPL240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Miklos is very knowledgable in the subject taught, and expresses a clear interest in topics that are discussed in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2014<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Absolutely worst professor ever! Not an easy grade! Not easily understood-he never makes sense (the food references...). He didn't even bother to engage the class...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2013<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class was extremely boring. Miklos constantly went off on tangents relating to the subject, but the anecdotes had nothing to do with the topic. He once tried using food as an example to illustrate the situation in the Middle-East. I wouldn't have taken the class if I had the chance to go back in time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2013<br>Class Name: PAX218<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid his classes. The man is quite difficult to understand and is terrible at lecturing, throwing in his own political agenda and personal anecdotes whenever possible. Not much is content is obtained through the vague readings and yet he expects 9-10 pages papers for midterms. And based on what? He also complains A LOT. Never again.</div></div></div></body></html>
