I despise math but he was there to help me, I worked hard and got an A+ in the class without wanted to pull out all of my hair. He is so sweet and really truly cares about his students. He expects great things from you and wont tolerate laziness but he gives you so many opportunities to excel- If you don't it is your fault. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've had.

Math is not my strongest point and he went step by step through everything. The study guide is identical to the midterm and final. I missed two weeks because of mono and I still ended up with an A because he gave me time to make up the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The only way this class could be easier is if Jim foster typed the work up for you. He walks you through every little detail and lets you out early, giving you time with him to work on homework.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's great! I really enjoyed having him as a professor. He will make sure everyone in the class is on the same page, and he's very helpful if you're not. He's also really encouraging. He even says at the beginning, &quot;I promise that you will NOT fail my class! I know you're that good, and so am I!&quot; haha. Great professor, really funny guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It was such an easy class!

He is awesome, he really helps out if someone is falling behind during the group activities. There is only a midterm and final, the first half of homeworks are due before you take the midterm and the rest are due on the day of the final. Also the final is not accumulative!</div></div></div></body></html>
