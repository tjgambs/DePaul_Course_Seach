She took forever to tell people bad news- too friendly. Very nice, but weirded me out with her constant smiling. I don't think ANYONE is that chipper all of the time. Take her, but you won't learn anything.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2005<br>Class Name: INDSTUDY<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really nice and not only will she give you an A, but will write you an outstanding letter of rec.
