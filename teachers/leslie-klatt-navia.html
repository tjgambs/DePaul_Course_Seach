    Leslie is my absolute favorite spanish teacher at DePaul. The class was easy but I also learned a lot. I wish I could take her for every single spanish class. She's super chill.

    The most helpful professor ever, I've had her from spanish 101 to 103, and she really wants us to learn. She understand us students really well, when we zone out she understand that it happens but she still explains the concepts again. Amazing teacher really, makes the subject enjoyable to learn!                     -DJ

    I took Leslie's classes for 101 through 103. She is an AMAZING teacher, and so incredibly helpful. I feel so confident going into my Intermediate levels having had her. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LEARN SPANISH, YOU HAVE TO TAKE HER. You won't regret it!

    Leslie is a good teacher. She is kind and very lax with attendance. You need to show up for the tests and do all the homework of course but she was an easy A

    she has to of been one of the most helpful spanish teachers i have ever had. she is always willing to help if you need it, and i usually did. she involved the class alot, hardly any homework. i took her for 101 and 102 and had her husband for 103, who once you get used to his accent is just as good.

    Spanish is fun in general so i give her no credit for making the class fun. Does an average teaching job, but is not very clear on her explanations. Seems to be quite disorganized and is usually not there doing office hours. Not the best, but not the worst.

    I dont know how somone said she grades hard, she doesnt! Our class was canceled and we always got lt out early. She is a fun person but if you intend to go on with spanish, take someone else. She is so nice, people will just walk all over her and its hard to teach a class that way.She will drop the lowest test, composition, and homework.Easy Class!

    This time around I liked her much better. Maybe because she was out for most of the quarter... Hmm. Otherwise, still pretty good.

    She is really nice, if you seem like you are taking an interest you will get a better grade.  It's better that she knows you.

    She is very helpful and easy. She does not except late work at all, even if you were in the hospital dying (joke). Anyhow, she is a great professor for non-native speakers. She takes her time with students and really is interested in what students have to say. Participation is key for a good grade.

    Leslie was a good professor. She took time just to make study guides for the class! Very nice and willing to help. The only drawback is she's a communist and will give you dirty looks if you don't agree with her.

    I could tell that Leslie worked really hard to prepare helpful materials, outside of what was in the book, in order to clarify what we were studying. I really recommend her class-I learned much more than I had expected
