Don't get the textbook. He's a great teacher. Very clear, very smart, very personable.  He brings in a ton of guest speakers. Get ready to participate, because it matters.  Take his study guides seriously. They relate a lot to the tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2015<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>If you're really into finance and want something more than just textbook learning he is your guy. If not, you're going to the struggle. Make sure to read the WSJ, that's basically the text of the class. You will discuss it pretty much every class. A lot of his tests are based on his lectures so missing class may be detrimental to your grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2015<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is fun. Gets you paying attention to real world events and makes sure you understand them. A lot of guest speakers, but all are interesting and worth while. There is a group project so make sure you get a good group or it will make this class annoying. Overall great class. Would recommend taking him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2014<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Possibly one of the greatest professors I have taken throughout my college. Professor Black really enjoys teaching the class . Dont buy the book. Come to class take good notes, read WSJ and honestly you should be able to get a B on the midterm and final. Study a little and you got an A. Has two projects in class but they are easy also.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2014<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't buy book. When he says small assignments-you arr going to spend hours upon hours on them. For 10 weeks it's non stop work and then final&mid term on top of all of it. Projects are time consuming and due every week.He's too busy grading all the work he assigns to answer questions in a timely matter. However, he's a nice guy and well connected.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2014<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Black was one of, if not the best, instructors I have had as a student at DePaul. I think it is important that the concepts be related to the context of the real world and current markets. No one could have done this better than professor Black. I think we must have had at least 6 speakers from the banking world come in and talk to us.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2014<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing professor. I have much more knowledge about the real world, he ties in lessons to the WSJ, and I genuinely enjoyed being in the class. Even now I still keep up with reading the news and staying up on current events. Very helpful with projects. Worth going to class even though it's not necessary.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/15/2013<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I have ever had in my life. He is one of the few who ties the textbook to the real world. Great asset to DePaul. He is very helpful but demanding too. If you want to learn a real world experience and WSJ, take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2013<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable professor who wants his students to succeed. He really wants his students to learn and is always available for help and questions. Fair grader. If you take notes and study the study guides you'll do well. Actually grades you for participating making attendance important. DePaul did a great job by bringing Professor Black on board</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2013<br>Class Name: FIN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Take!Great professor has a passion for teaching.

He always made himself available for assistance outside the classroom for help.
