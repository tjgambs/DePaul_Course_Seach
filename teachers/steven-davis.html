He will give you bad grades on assignments without explaining why, and won't give you an answer if you ask directly either. Very unclear about what he wants from you on assignments on top of that, it seems like you can't do anything right for this guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2011<br>Class Name: PSY395<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems nice on the surface, until he takes points off assignments with little to no explanation. Don't bother e-mailing him about it, he won't get back to you. On top of all of this he lost part of the entire class' final, so he couldn't upload the final grades until 1 month after they were supposed to be in. So disorganized it's not even funny.</div></div></div></body></html>
