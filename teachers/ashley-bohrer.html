She is always willing to meet at office hours and is a great resource to help expand social consciousness. She is tough, but she is always there to challenge you and help you grow. I definitely recommend taking Ashley as a professor, one of my favorites at DePaul. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/08/2014<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ashley was an incredible professor. She is so gifted and yet so humble. Taking her class was challenging but extremely interesting. The material was really confusing at times, but she is always there to help you. Nice, cute, smart lady.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ashley is what a professor should be. She challenges her students to learn heavy but important topics. People who don't take education seriously will drop her class due to their aspire for a degree rather than education. She isn't easy but you will learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2014<br>Class Name: PHL233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>I love Ashley! She is very intelligent and knows exactly what she is talking about. She is a very tough grader though, and she takes grammar usage and citations very seriously. The reading was heavy, but very interesting. This class opened my eyes more than I expected and I would definitely take this professor again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A-</div><div id="right"><div>Ashley is incredibly smart and gifted. As a person she expects a lot out of her students and REALLY hard on them. She isnt very approacable or kind. HOWEVER, one of the best teachers at depaul. I learned so much and got a lot out of the class. She uses relatable examples to get her point across. really smart, clear and helpful. take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible.

She's tough, but she's a lot of fun. I learned a lot from her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awful teacher. Destroys the integrity of the class by spending every lecture trying to convince you that she's right about everything. If you voice your own opinion she will shoot you down immediately. Incredibly arrogant and uses her high intelligence in all the wrong ways. Too much time spent lecturing rather than engaging in something useful.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher. She's a gifted communicator, incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable, and she's fun! I actually looked forward to every class because I learned so much from her. She's by far the best teacher I've ever had and also one of the most interesting people  I've ever met. I can't imagine anyone not liking her she's awesome!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>please do not take her! i regret not dropping this class!!! too much reading, she talks very fast, not helpful at all, tough grader!DO NOT TAKE HER!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Today was the first day of class, and I am trying to get out already.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2013<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very rude and incredibly pretentious. She's also wicked smart and her lectures are pretty interesting and often eye-opening. But unless you're alright with being taught by someone who will shoot down every cool idea you have and replace it with what she thinks is right, I would not take her class. She's a mean-spirited person.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/21/2013<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is extremely motivated by what she stands for and is very smart. I have learned a lot just from 10 weeks in this class. She does talk fast however, and as one should be with the course, I was very confused most of the time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really like this Professor. She knows her stuff. I dont like Philosophy, I think its very boring. But this professor made me like the subject. We read three texts and wrote paper for each. She is a hard grader but if u follow the instructions for the papers u'll be fine. Attendance is important nd she has a lot of pop quizzes</div></div></div></body></html>
