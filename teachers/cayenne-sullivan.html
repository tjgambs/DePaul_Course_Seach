    Pretty easy class. Got an A- (I assume because of my final paper), but she is pretty straight forward and it is a very easy class. Take it

    Shes extremely easy. Class seemed like it was ten minutes long. She lets you out early most of the time. Her style is interesting I would agree, but if your looking for an easy A take her.

    she's really easy...if you want a pretty easy A i suggest taking her...class is not all to entertaining though..but the papers are simple..rough draft, peer review, and revising..nothing too complicated

    She's not as bad as they say. At least the projects are fun. Just being decently creative and you will get a good grade. She is decently helpful. And she explains the assignment well. And seriously who cares what a teacher wears.

    Um, so um yeah. This teacher thinks  english is an art class.  Interesting assignments, but doesn't really teach you how to write.

    There is a difference between and easy class where you learn and an easy class where you don't learn. This class was so easy and I learned nothing. I did all the assignment an hour before class. She says um like 1000 times in class. This class was a waste of money and it is my fault for not switching professors.

    English will be served spicy.....actually not at all. I can honestly say it was top 3 for the most boring classes of my educational career. She gives homework for basically every class session but it's easy, and I could never figure out for certain how much it was worth. Does a good job of preparing for the final paper, everything else=worthless.
