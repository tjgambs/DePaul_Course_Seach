Probably one of the better professors in the department now. DO NOT look at any reviews before 2015, because she is so much better now.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2015<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Even though she doesn't usually teach math, she knew what she was doing and was familiar with excel, percents etc. She always responded to e-mails and graded quickly.  Easy to talk with and didn't give off any surly or negative attitude, you just have to talk to her. She's also the best looking math teacher I've ever had, which helps. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2015<br>Class Name: CHE134<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Meyer is a professor where you get what you give. Chemistry is a difficult course. Go to her office hours, she likes when you are inquisitive and clearly enjoys chemistry. She grades fair and is willing to explain her logic if you are confused. Overall good professor and I am taking her for Biochem. Her low ratings are from her first year.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2015<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quite intimidating at first but she warms up to the class after a few sessions. You'll appreciate her in the end though, because she takes the time to learn everyone's name. She also tries really hard to make jokes but everyone's too scared to laugh. But she's cool. Go to her office hours. Will take for the rest of the GenChem sequence.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2014<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Meyer is very sweet and a good professor; I would take her again for chemistry. She's very clear and willing to help both in and out of class in order to prepare us for exams. Chemistry is a tough subject no matter which professor you have, so prepare to put in the hours studying because they won't hold your hand if you want an A or B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2014<br>Class Name: 130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is condescending to her students and cannot teach. Tests were made by the two teachers teaching the same course in different sections. She blamed these teachers for making the test so hard and why over half the class dropped out by midterms. DO NOT TAKE!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/27/2014<br>Class Name: 133<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HORRIBLE lab teacher and at times can be very meanrude to her students. She is not very approachable and is not very helpful when you go in for individual help. If you take her class go to the TA's if you have questions in the lab or for the lab report. Avoid if possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2014<br>Class Name: CHE132<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She uses a lot of examples in her class and is very clear about what will be on the tests. She had her own out of class review for most of the tests where she told which specific types of questions to focus on. She's also very relatable, which is kind of unexpected for the DePaul Chemistry department.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2014<br>Class Name: CHE134<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Meyer is one of the best chemistry teachers I have had at DePaul. She provides good examples in class. She is funny and one of the coolest chemistry teachers. You can go to her office hours and get the help you need. She is very approachable and just down right cool. I would definitely recommend taking one of her classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/24/2014<br>Class Name: CHE134<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really down to Earth. She has lines out the door during her office hours because she's so helpful. She makes sure that students understand the material and gives a myriad of examples which are very similar to those on the test. Take her for lab or lecture, can't go wrong either way!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2014<br>Class Name: CHEM130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Almost everyone fails chem at DePaul but Meyer is a very good. If you work hard and put effort into the class it won't be that bad. If you don't put effort into the class she won't like you but you can change that if you start putting effort in. The class isn't a walk in the park so do your work. I will be taking other classes she teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2014<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Truth be told chemistry at DePaul sucks in general. Every student thinks their chem teacher is bad bc their class avg is a 60% or something similar to that. Dr. Meyer is one of the best, she does pick favorites, so get on her good side and make conversation with her. Had her for lab and she is super easy! Atleast she is better than the others...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/22/2014<br>Class Name: CHEM130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful and is willing to sit down with you and explain until you get it. Also she does not make the chemistry test! All the chemistry teachers make them together so test are fair. Also,  she the best looking professor I've had.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: CHE131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Most awful professor ever! She doesnt care about her students, she isnt clear in lecture and then expects us all to get A's on the exams.  Avoid her!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: CHE101<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: F</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE FOR CHEMISTRY! you will fail. class average was a 30-40% on every test no joke! she refuses to curve! takes approx 8 weeks to get exams back, insane. Highest grade I ever got was 56%, and I'm proud. She seems to want students to fail, not a happy person. Teaches to board, never makes eye contact. Assigns 70 pages of reading every night!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2014<br>Class Name: CHM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible and useless professor. She's clearly not familiar with Chemistry, or even math. She needs a leap frog to learn some basic math skills. Doesn't do any relevant practice problems. Basically, you're teaching yourself chem. Avoid. It's true, you could learn more from a rock.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2014<br>Class Name: 130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hey everyone needs to stop hating on Dr. Meyer. Sure, she's the worst professor in Chicago, but I think she's a sweetheart! If you go to one of her meetings, she's actually nice. Maybe she's just nervous when she is teaching and that comes off as disconnected, rude, and uninterested. Although she just teaches to the board.  Uses the book too much!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2014<br>Class Name: 131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not helpful. If you talk to her, she's not any nicer. My friends think she's a sourpuss. In class, she constantly deprecates DePaul! I couldn't take her elementary mathematical errors, poor attitude, rudeness, and enigmatic method of conveying knowledge. I sat in Southern's class, much better! She's actually enthusiastic. I hope Jen can IMPROVE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2014<br>Class Name: 131<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>You could learn more chemistry from a flask deionized water. TAKE SOUTHERN and avoid!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/08/2014<br>Class Name: 130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I will try to be as fair as possible. I could tell right away she was new to teaching. sometimes she would make jokes in class so I didn't this horrible mean side, but all she does is give examples. Extremely boring and shows no interest in Chemistry. I regret taking her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2013<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: F</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher. Makes simple math errors when showing examples, is totally and completely rude... all around NOT the job for her. I'm not one to blame my grade on the teacher, but she sure didnt help. Rude, slow, unhelpful, and unclear. Stay away. Really though. Stay away. Prepare to teach yourself, a rock is more helpful than Dr. Meyer</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2013<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you land this teacher at any point in your life drop the class or transfer the class in. You'll learn absolutely nothing! She insults students and will give review sheets and not even go over them so it's a free period to do whatever you want. There's other chem classes and they actually attempt to teach. Our class avg. Is a 62!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2013<br>Class Name: CHEM130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>worse teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2013<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have one thing to say and that is STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS TEACHER AS POSSIBLE!

She read off of a sheet of paper and struggles with simple math. If you need this class avoid her at all cost! She teaches the bare minimum and then teachers who do teach gives us a hard test. Our class average has been D-F range this whole semester. AVOID!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2013<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far THE WORST PROFESSOR i have ever encountered!she never taught the subject correctly and she has a horrible attitude. several times in class she was not able to do simple math such as 10/2. that was on a good day, on a bad day a student would have to interrupt and TEACH her! youtube! be and google were my professors this qrt</div></div></div></body></html>
