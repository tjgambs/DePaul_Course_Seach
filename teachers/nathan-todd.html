    He is a great professor. Very helpful and always is interested in feedback. He is enthusiastic and has a passion for what he does. Work load is not bad at all and exam  3 (the final is optional)!

    Great professor! Really helps students and is a pretty easy grader. Tests are all really fair and you get a review sheet with everything you need on it. Goes over readings completely in class. Definitely take him!
