Good teacher but you have to ask questions.  Gives good feedback on assignments and is picky on grading homework but when it comes to tests and project is a reasonable grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2015<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great guy, but a terrible teacher. He gives you a quick overview of the assignment and then you are on your own. I would not take this professor. You will become very stressed over a class that is supposed to be easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2014<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this professor. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2014<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is a strict grader and most of your final grade will be based upon your midterm and final exam. He literally teaches you excel work like you have worked with it before. (Too fast) He also is not the best person to go for help. I prefer a tutor because they explain it to me without being rushed. Do not take him for this class. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2014<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>Kotowski is a decent guy, but just a mediocre teacher. MOST of your grade is based on the midterm and final. I worked extremely hard, got tutoring, and took my time on assignments but ended up getting a B- because of the midterm/final, which I thought was unfair. He is not awful, but he and his class were not weighted fairly or worth my tuition.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Each class consisted of powerpoint presentations and then followed by a group activity which makes the class feel not so long. If you finish your activity in class then less homework for you. The notes are very clear and are super helpful with the homework. I advise sitting up close because you cant follow along sitting in the back. Overall, good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/18/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>good class. He made it fun and interesting. I was able to get a lot of work done in class. Project was a pain but I liked my group members.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>His lessons and homework were both incredibly boring and tedious. VERY picky grader. Brought no enthusiasm to class whatsoever. I directed all my questions to the TA cos he couldn't be bothered to help me. Group assignments were all bogus and frustrating. Nice guy, but he just can't teach to save his life. Avoid him if you value having free time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2013<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class is fine- boring but hes enthusiastic and pretty clear. HOWEVER, he is horrible at responding to emails and put up the wrong notes online before a mid-term and didnt fix it until about 3 hours before (that's the only way to study as there is not textbook for the class). He also failed to tell us the midterm was timed until about 10 till.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Professor. A little bit of a picky grader, however, his class is easy, and he is easy to understand. Is a very chill professor. Hard to communicate by email though.</div></div></div></body></html>
