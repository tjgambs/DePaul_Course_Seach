He got me hooked into existentialism. He fully explains his positions and is always willing to stay after class to talk. He and I continue to be friends despite being relocated to Boston College. I hope for all the best, and come back to DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2013<br>Class Name: PHL2<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Truly inspiring class and professor.
