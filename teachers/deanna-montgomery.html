I tried very hard to succeed in this class but I felt like she never acknowledged that. A final on top of the HUGE group project and presentation was uncalled for. I learned some stuff, sure, but I just think this class would have been tolerable if I had another professor. She wasn't nice.</div></div></div></body></html>
