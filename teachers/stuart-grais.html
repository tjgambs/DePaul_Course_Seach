    It's a really easy class. You don't need to buy a camera, you can use a simple point and shoot. You can rent one of the fancy ones from the Cage though. His assignments are really easy. This class is a breeze and he's really kinda and funny. Lots of adventures with the photography (took it in the fall) and is really helpful. Take few notes.
