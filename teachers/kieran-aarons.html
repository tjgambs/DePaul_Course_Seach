Tells you exactly what he expects. You have 2 major papers which are 2-3 pages and easy to do. final is a paper 7-8. But all the articles you talk about in class you have to print out. And this is annoying since some of these articles are like 40 pages long(im not kidding) and you have to print it out. But GREAT TEACHER. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kieran is helpful if you need to seek outside of class. In class he had a fair and impartial view toward different opinions. However, he tended to overcomplicate the material as well as take too much time in class to talk about a reading. If you're not a philosophy major, be prepared to be confused and not follow Prof. Aarons' lectures 100%. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2014<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome prof! Seriously, i'm not too into philosophy but he always makes sure you get it before moving on. Seriously made me like philosophy. Senior here so I've had it all, he's one of the best, could see tenure long term</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2014<br>Class Name: PHL232<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good professor. During class he will pick on everyone, whether you know the answer or not and try to embarrass youmake you look like an idiot. He tries his best to explain the readings but isn't successful. I would never take a class with him again or a philosophy class in general thanks to him. Maybe it's because I'm not into philosophy? </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was so confusing but Professor Aarons tried to clear it up the best he could... and succeeded most of the time. Super easy class but be ready to participate a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was such a blow-off type of teacher.  The readings had to be printed even though you can clearly read them off your computer.  I got a good grade, so if that's all you're looking for you should take him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Thanks to him I plan on minoring in Philosophy. Kieran gets to the point of the questions we should be asking. He is a bit biased with his left wing views and the statistics/data used. I still enjoyed his class as sort of a reality check.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2012<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I ended up really liking this class. Very interesting, not a hard grader. He will definitely challenge you in class but homework isn't bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2012<br>Class Name: PHIL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Aarons is funny, kind, and very intelligent. His reading assignments are very interesting and will get you thinking about topics you've never thought about before. If you love philosophy, you'll love Aarons. He does have a liberal slant, but even if you are conservative it is good to get out of your comfort zone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/24/2011<br>Class Name: PHL204<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I was interested in philosophy before taking this class, but after having read the readings and attending lectures, I was hooked.  Kieran is a great professor.  You can tell he loves philosophy because of the energy he brings to his lectures and the class in general. Take him! He's awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2011<br>Class Name: PHIL101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Aarons is a bit pretentious. I can see how one might think he's very attractive but if you imagine him out of the classroom and in a public place, you'll see that he is not. He is an easy grader and his class is alright. He is a little biased but overall, not the worst class I've taken at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/16/2011<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved his class. I missed a few classes, but it was not a big deal. He is an easy grader and makes you think. Plus, he's very attractive. :)</div></div></div></body></html>
