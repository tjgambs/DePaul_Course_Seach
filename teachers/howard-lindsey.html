He gives a Midterm a Final and a Paper. If you do good on the midterm, paper, and the extra 5 points you attain from outside projects, like watching documentaries etc. you will get an easy A plus his final exam is optional if you have a grade you're satisfied with! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2014<br>Class Name: HIST247<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Read the text book in full and you will ace the inclass midterm  if you do well on the midterm you can waive out of the final.

I learned a lot in his classes. However, he is an extremely hard grader. Do not expect an A. Also, he is quite intimidating when it comes to his questions directed towards the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2014<br>Class Name: ABD257<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very few professors have captured my attention as much as Prof. Lindsay. His lecture style is very captivating and he is not afraid to be controversial which I've always respected. He expects good work from you and will be quick to compliment you when provide it. I highly recommend taking his classes. They've changed my perspective immensely.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2014<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lindsey is extremely knowledgable about the topic. He is a good lecturer as well. It is hard to get an A though because there are very few assignments. Don't expect a lot of feedback on your work Optional final. I would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/20/2014<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Lindsey is a great 'old school' teacher and I say this because the professor and current technology do not work well together. He's rather a hard grader. Pretty difficult for a level 100 class honestly. He makes class fairly interesting. He does bash religion like no other. Overall decent, but if history isn't your thing then avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: HST247<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am not a fan of history but Dr.Lindsey makes the class enjoyable. You learn new facts that were not taught to you during high school. There's 2 papers and a midterm. If you get an A or a B+, the final is optional. Easy class to fulfill your understanding the past domain.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2012<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great historian and really knows his stuff. Gives realistic expectations and just wants you to pay attention during lectures, which are usually pretty good. We watch a lot of documentary's but def recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2012<br>Class Name: HIS248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You dont need any of the texts, just go to class, dont miss class at all, his essays arent bad, his lectures are funn and eye opening, one paper (book review), one midterm, final, and  quick projects that you make up yourself(watch a documentary for example) i reccomend this guy to get your understanding the past requirements done.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy African American History credit. Offered extra credit. Gave an assignment to watch 5 movies and write a summary on them including 8 mile. He loves Detroit (hometown).

No quizzes but a lecture class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2012<br>Class Name: HST256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the best prof I had. His class is very interesting. U will enjoy his class. He may ask u to read a lot but I only read quarter of the text book and still manage to get an A. U just need to concentrate in his class and u will surely get an A.

Took his night class and never worried about falling asleep. He is very passionate about history but he bashes on religion like none other. The class is not easy. You need to put time and effort into your homework and studying. The more effort you put into this class, the better your results.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2011<br>Class Name: ABD101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I hope you like reading long, dense, and boring books because that's all you'll be reading for this class. Lindsey purposely makes his students feel unintelligent and goes about teaching in a very strict manner. His lectures are interesting but not worth the extreme amount of boring busy work. He brags about how busy he keeps his students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2011<br>Class Name: ABD256<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Professor, by far one of the best I have had at DePaul. Really got me interested in African/African American Studies. He really knows his stuff and is extremely interesting to listen to. The assigned books aren't really necessary. He seems a bit bigoted but as they class goes on you will get used to him. Definitely would take him again!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2011<br>Class Name: HIST248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor who really makes the class interesting.

Just very honest about the injustices African Americans faced, and tells it from an African American POV. You get to watch lots of videos/pop culture stuff..he sometimes brings props to class..TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/29/2010<br>Class Name: HIST248<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>First impression I got from this guy is he's a big Marxist. He kinda reminds me of Obama's former minister Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Other than that he's extremely knowledgeable on his subject and a joy to listen to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/23/2010<br>Class Name: HIS111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned a lot in this class because Dr. Lindsey is extremely knowledgeable about his subject. However, he is extremely biased, which ruined my overall experience. He is very stubborn. He also seems to have a general dislike for white people and Christians.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2010<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The professor was passionate about his subject but wasn't clear on what kind of sources to use for our term paper. He assumed freshmen new APA style formatting and was very rigid when it came to assignments. He never wanted to repeat himself when it came to requirments for assignments but didn't post them online. Assignment due dates changed often.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2010<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Teacher!!!!!!! He expects a lot from you but if you pay attention you are gonna be fine.  The best part of the class are his lectures, every single one is so interesting that there is no way you will ever fall asleep in his class. Definitely one of the most memorable classes in my college carrier. Had -A in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It is an easy A/B if you do your work and read (actually read/understand). Lectures are entertaining, and make the class go by quicker. Presents the material in a way that keeps me paying attention, and is very knowledgeable, would recommend him with any class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2009<br>Class Name: HIST111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hist 111 should have been named African American studies.  His notes are all over the place and you won't understand them unless you go to class. He relates everything (!!!) we learn about to African Americans and civil rights and talks to the class like you're a bunch of idiots.  Also a hard grader. I do not recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2009<br>Class Name: HST111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought I would like the class, and for a bit, I did. The problem is that he's a harsh grader, and there are very few sources of points in his class, being a paper, a midterm, and a final, so it's hard to make up for a bad grade. I would not recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: HIST153<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didnt think he was a good teacher. I had him for discover and he repeated the same stats and points every week. Also didnt seem overly knowledgable. He assumes the ignorance of his students and doesnt like to be corrected. However hes a good man and his class was fun. Scared me into thinking college was gonna be hard and he was very wrong</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2008<br>Class Name: HST342<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you take any history classes at DePaul, they should be those taught by this teacher. He will require that you work hard, but he teaches in a way that makes you eager to learn. I always wanted to come to class just to hear him lecture. He also brought interesting resources to class that always enhanced his words. TAKE HIS CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/22/2008<br>Class Name: HST338<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>FAVORITE TEACHER AT DEPAUL!!! he is amazing.

Howard is an inspiring person who can teach in a way thats get you thinking about the intricate nature of the world.  So if you have the good fortune of taking his class listen to what he has to say and you will not be disappointed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2008<br>Class Name: HST246<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Loved it. I learned a ton. I was never interested in any history classes before but this was really enjoyable and I learned so much. All lecture but it was fun and he knows his stuff.

His knowledge and passion for the topics discussed in this class really show in the way he delivers the material. For a commerce student fulfilling a history requirement I lucked out getting Dr. Lindsey as a teacher. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Do the work, don't be lazy... it is not hard-PLUS it is interesting!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2007<br>Class Name: HST248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GOOD professor! Pretty easy explaining history. He actually makes me want to go to class and listen about his opinions about history. It sucks he's only teaching history! I would take him again!

Never have I learned so much in one class while putting in so little work. He is that effective. He is entertaining, shows lots of videos, and is very intelligent. Classes aren't boring despite a lot of lecturing. He is now one of my favorite profs at DePaul.  Highly recommended!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2007<br>Class Name: HST218<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was easy but attendance is mandatory.

It is made up of 2 book reviews, 5 projects, in class essay midterm, & optional final. I don't know if it was just me, but I felt his instructions were unclear & I always ended up with a grade of 80% (kinda frustrating when you don't know how to improve). I think there are better classes out there.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2006<br>Class Name: HST247<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Interesting class, but he spends most of the time complaining about racial injustices than actually teaching historical facts. This might be because it is an African American history course, but still, it should not be so biased. None of the other history professors I have taken made such opinionated comments. Somewhat disappointing to be honest.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2006<br>Class Name: HST257<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this class.

You'll never get out of class early, but you'll learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2004<br>Class Name: HIS248<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Lindsey is one of DePaul's finest.
