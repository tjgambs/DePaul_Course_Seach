Before i took this professor i read negative comments on him and hoped for the best. Except, that did not happen! DO NOT TAKE BOLON. All he does is talk in circles, and papers never are clear as to what he wants. again. DONT TAKE HIM</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/25/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Bolon is not helpful when you meet with him. His paper prompts are intricately complicated and overly wordy. No matter how much effort you put forth in the class, you still receive the grade he WANTS you to receive. The use of the book is lacking, making me wonder why i bought the $80 piece.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Everyday you had no idea what we were going to discuss, and I think he didn't either.  Attendance was definitely mandatory, but it's not like we would've missed anything had it not been.  He's big on class participation and that's the reason I didn't get an A.  I heard him tell ppl he would finish grading their papers in 10 min &#63;&#63; not good grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a good teacher...he explains things in detail and is always willing to help...attendance is mandatory, and it get boring at times but he can be entertaining with his dramatic examples in speech.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2008<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i didnt like the acting we had to do. i didnt learn anything. he hands out grades as he pleases. i felt i worked hard and he probably didnt even read my papers.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/19/2007<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is sometimes funny but he's very vague.  He is very unclear about assignments and also treats english like some acting class.  He made us get up and act,improvise, and perform and told us to &quot;get into character&quot;  ALWAYS overestimated the amount of time he had and always let us out late. Unless you like to aruge with someone, take a pass.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Quite confusing</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/21/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>okok most of these comments are against him for his papers. yeah his ways of grading are weird cause you never know what to expect but he is a really cool guy. young, great lectures, and you can talk to him if you need extra help with somthing.  I would recomend him for ppl with good writing skills.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/07/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although the paper topics are fascinating and relevant, the prompts are only legible to English majors. Prof. Bolon has the usual English major haughtiness mixed in with a college student's tendency to get wasted and tell the tale later. I warmed up to him. I did well in the class because I had prior writing experience; don't expect an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2007<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His lectures made class pass by quickly but his papers are misguided and graded solely on opinion and what he feels like giving out. Great opportunity to re-write most of your papers at the end of the quarter. Book was completely useless</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2006<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dreaded going to this class the oratorys blow he is such an **** and makes fun of you and asks you questions on the spot he knows you will not even know where to start on answering.

Also, he doesn't seem very organized and he's always late to class.  I liked the class and the workload wasn't bad, but he's an odd grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2005<br>Class Name: COLLEGEREADING<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>My class believe that he has issues because he is short and looks like his students. He is remarkably intelligent and references everything from Lisa Simpson to Socrates.  He assigns a lot of readings that have little relevence to life and the tests.  He challenges you but offers little help.  He is pompus, but you learn to love him</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is cool, but he's really arrogant.  The prompts for papers we have to write are impossible to read. I usually read them about 9 times before I can figure out what the hell I'm supposed to write about.  And be careful asking questions, he'll probably embarass you in front of the class and then make it worse by apologizing next class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/22/2005<br>Class Name: READING<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this guy is cool and all, but can act an ass at times...he is very open-minded and he'll say what's on his head whether you like it or not....he's pretty easy. he loves to pick on people and especially if you're one of the loud ones in class. just do his work and you'll ace his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2005<br>Class Name: 101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>its better then alot of english classes.. really interesting.. you wont fall asleep.. its alot of fun.. although he is to smart for his own good somtimes.. cool guy tho</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/30/2005<br>Class Name: 10<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's so young and still getting the hang of things.  The class itself was just completly pointless, but I don't blame him.  He at times seemed to be trying too hard to fit in with us students.  Very funny, but sometimes acts too &quot;smart&quot; for us.  Pretty decent guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2005<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Guy's favorite phrase is that you are being 'vague' when he himself is vague.  also uses big words to 1. confuse you 2. cant explain what he is trying to say ne other way... there is no pleasing this man</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2005<br>Class Name: ENG101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so cute and young; but easy.

Expect to be always working on a paper, but the papers are fairly open-ended and thought-provoking.  He knew the names of everyone in this freshman class, I would have him for class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He grades really tough on his essays, but does give chances for revisions, but revisions are graded much harder and it is very hard to get a good grade on the essays.  After being used to straight A's, I am very suprised at getting C's and at most C+'s on my papers.  Interesting subjects though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/01/2004<br>Class Name: ENG103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Bolon is an excellent professors.

Takes time out to meet with students individually to help them out as much as possible. If you have any problems meeting deadlines, he's more than willing to give you an extension and he's very understanding.
