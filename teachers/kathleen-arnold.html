Her lectures were really good, and I really learned a lot. There's definitely a lot of reading, and not of modern texts either. Be prepared to read difficult texts that have been both translated and are hundreds of years old. Overall, great class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2015<br>Class Name: PSC347234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Arnold is hands down the best teacher I've had at DePaul. She is VERY passionate about what she teaches: political thought, immigration or human rights. If you truly pay attention during class the criteria for grading will become very clear. She is hilarious and will shut you down if you say something stupid, but you will benefit from it. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/09/2015<br>Class Name: PSC231<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Arnold is very specific in her requirements for the class. Yes, as others have said, her syllabus is long and maybe a little tedious, but it's only that way to help you pass. She really wants her students not only to pass, but to also deliver more than they expected they could. She is very helpful, and it's not impossible to get an A from her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2015<br>Class Name: PSC230<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Without a doubt the worst professor I have had at DePaul. As someone who loves Classical Political Thought I could not stand the course. Professor Arnold is one of the least helpful and rudest professors I have taken. Her knowledge of the classical thinkers is extremely superficial and thus any deviation from her horrible notes or opinions Rudeness</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2014<br>Class Name: PSC234<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An organized person's worst nightmare. Much like class, even the syllabus is a soapbox rant. Think of Alicia Silverstone in "Clueless", that is essentially the type of professor Arnold is. She constantly states how the class is beneath her, and all her time at Harvard. Only plus  is the readings are great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2014<br>Class Name: PSC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I agree with others on here, Dr. Arnold makes DePaul a better place. She assigns hard books, but these are high level courses. That said, she will spend the time to make the text CRYSTAL clear. I wish I could take her again but I am graduating.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2014<br>Class Name: PSC331<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Arnold is one of the best professors at DePaul. If the entire Political Science department was like her DePaul would be a better place. Do the readings, work hard, and pay attention, and you will do well. Blow it off and you will not.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: PSC230<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was my second class with Arnold. I like taking her b/c there is no research paper, just 10 one-paragraph summaries, which are a piece of cake. Midterm and final= 5 short answer and one 3 paragraph essay. 6 books total were required. Reading is quite a bit, but not too much (40+ pages). Lecture can be a bit dull; don't digress, she hates it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2014<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She was by far the worst professor I have ever had at DePaul. I still couldn't even tell you what that class is about because if you don't come in a political science genius, you will be lost the whole time. She was rude, called people out in class, flustered ALL the time and had no idea how to smoothly run a class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2013<br>Class Name: PSC367<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof.Arnold is clearly very well informed on the topics she teaches. I really appreciate the depth that she brings to lectures - it makes me feel like I'm at  better school than DePaul! If you are not interested in actually learning about the topic than you might think her lectures are boring- but if that's the case maybe you should change majors..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2013<br>Class Name: PSC234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Arnold is one of my favorites at DePaul. Her lectures are dense and you learn so much! I hate the short quarter system, but I feel like I get a semesters worth of information in her class, while still being able to absorb everything. She is a fair grader and will help you with a re-write if you do poorly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2013<br>Class Name: PSC217<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arnold's lectures are VERY dry.  She HATES digressions. Reading isn't much. No research paper (thank goodness). Instead, you do only 10 1 page paragraph summaries on the reading. Exams include short answer and 1essay question. She provides study guide for midterm and final. Doesn't flood you with emails which is good. I recommend for PSC students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2013<br>Class Name: PSC367<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Arnold is awesome! Super knowledgable about the topics and hasn't numerous articles and books on it. Readings are interesting and relevant and she shows great movies too. Always is available by email and outside of class. Lectures a lot but you can learn a TON from just listening to her. I wish I could take more classes with her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/03/2013<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Arnold is absolutely amazing! She lectures a lot but is passionate and knowledgeable about the topics so I felt that I learned a lot from just listening. She always engages the class and asks questions. A lot of students dont do the readings so she ends up talking a lot. She responsive to emails and is always willing to talk to students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2013<br>Class Name: PSC367<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Didn't really like her that much at first, but she grew on me. She's a great person and really smart. Very liberal, but I'm a conservative and you don't really learn anything from people who agree with you. Lots of work but then again these are political science college courses. If you are looking for an easy A, go take a P.E. class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/05/2013<br>Class Name: PSC234<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Arnold is an iterating  person, her class not so much. She is very helpful and passionate about teaching. The class is all about readings(too much reading) and disscussion  the next day. She will give you a study guide for the midterm and final which makes it easier to get a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2013<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Arnold is an interesting person. She is very intelligent and passionate about her field of research, but is extrmely biased and shoots down opinions that differ from her super liberal, anti corporation ones. However, she is extremely helpful and more than happy to work with students on their papers and other work. A good professor overall</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2012<br>Class Name: PSC233<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the teacher is great! loved the class! very easy A if you attend her class. She types all her notes and posts them on D2L....classical political thought isn't interesting in general, but she tries to make it as interesting as possible. I'd recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2012<br>Class Name: PSC344<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love this professor and love her courses. Extremely intelligent, lectures are concise and informative. Do what you're supposed to do and you'll learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2012<br>Class Name: PSC234<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so... arnold is awesome... she'll call you out if you're an idiot an make stupid comments. but hey the entire class is thinking it so she's just saying what everyone else knows. The readings weren't hard. the write ups were easy! and as long as you say a few things in class you're fine. finals areez</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: PSC233<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The books are FASCINATING. Such great reads! The class...not so much. Thankfully though, as long as you do the readigns you'll be fine. I spend class daydreaming practically and got an easy A on both midterm and final. But the readings are dense, you have to really be into political thought.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2011<br>Class Name: PSC344<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is dismissive of other's opinions that do not align with her own. Moreover, she is extremely dry and unable to relate to a student. She will twist your comments into her own wording, which is just plain rude. I highly recommend not taking her, and if I saw all the bad posts on her I would have avoided her as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2011<br>Class Name: PSC234<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly dry, and hard to follow.

I can see what the other raters are saying, she can be dry and boring IF YOU DO NOT READ. If you read and participate in class this is a very helpful class. She is willing to help outside of class too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2011<br>Class Name: PSC233<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY boring, talks about the material already read and does not really clarify, had a hard time keeping up with her, I don't really recommend to take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2011<br>Class Name: PSC233<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The class overall was super easy. There was no papers, just turned in a total of 10 paragraph reading summaries over the course of the class. There is a midterm and final consisting of short essays all of which she provided a study guide with the exact questions that would be on it. However her classes are dull with a lot of reading.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2011<br>Class Name: PSC233<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Atrocious professor. I missed a midterm due to medical reasons took 5 emails for her to respond. Work load is too heavy for a class of this nature. Rambles on constantly and no ideas connect. I wish I had the option of dropping.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/01/2011<br>Class Name: PSC233<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Poor teaching style.
