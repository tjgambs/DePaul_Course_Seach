She always had a positive attitude when teaching, which made me want to learn. I appreciate how she was considerate of us as students. For example, she allowed us to work on group projects in class because she interpreted that students taking an 8am probably did so to make more time during the day.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2013<br>Class Name: ORGC200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the nicest people ever!  The class was really interesting and helpful in actual life.  The group projects were so much fun (maybe i just had really awesome group members.) But seriously take her. The tests are challenging but hey it's college.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2012<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Would recommend her. She is fairly easy, but you do have work you have to do. Tests aren't too bad but some of the questions could have had two answers and were difficult to know which was the "textbook answer."</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2012<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very sweet but not an affective teacher. class was not hard at all but walked away not knowing much...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2012<br>Class Name: ORGC201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kristen is an awesome, helpful, friendly teacher.  She can be a little slow returning grades but she truly helped me become a better public speaker and was always really energetic and positive even in an 8am class. The only downside is that her test questions can be unclear or vague at times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2012<br>Class Name: CMNS201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Fun. Interesting. Provides a lot of good info and resources. Also, fairly easy. Do the basic assignments (not hard) and show up - you'll get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a fun teacher!  She's also a very lenient but fair grader; she knows it's not the most fascinating info but she does a great job of running a lively class.  Very easy all around, and a lot of fun.  I recommend taking her class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Pengelly is by far my favorite professor at DePaul. The class I took with her was not difficult; it just required a bit of work. And do not buy the text book; I didn't use it once the entire year. Anyways, this professor is amazing, and I strongly encourage you to take a class with her. You will not regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is a very sweet young lady, new to teaching. Class was one of my easier ones and was fun too. Your grade is based on attendance/participation, 3 speeches, a group presentation, 3 quizzes, a midterm, and a final. I promise you it is nothing nearly as bad as it sounds. Don't buy the textbook, just go through the powerpoints.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/28/2011<br>Class Name: CMNS201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div></div></div></div></body></html>
