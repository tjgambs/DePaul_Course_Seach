There is also a group project and presentation. The midterm is ectremely long and so is the final. She is really nice but not a great speaker.

Class can be interesting at times, but only take if you have a lot of time to spend.  There are weekly homework assignments and 2 big projects.  After all that work, I only got a B+.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2006<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Alot of homework, a group project and paper, test are strictly from homework and weekly quizes. Not a good speaker -- but very generous grader! A- , even though I got a D on the midterm..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2006<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! She is the worst public speaker ever! Her time management skills are not there, we would not cover the material we were tested on because she didnâ€™t have enough time to do it. On the date of our final she still was teaching material. We sat through 30-45minutes of lecture before we took the final. Take anyone but her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady, and I honestly believe she's trying her best. But the class doesn't doesn't flow very well, and seems to alternate between regurgitating the book without building on it, or ignoring it altogether.  Wants to cram a lot of material into the course but consequently suffers from lack of depth and only cursory attention to student questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2005<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2005<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh gosh, where do I begin&#63;  The 6 hour homework assignment in the 1st week&#63;  The mindless allegiance to inconsequential and trivial facts from the book that make up her tests.  I am a 3rd year student and she is easily the worst professor that I have ever had.  Enough work for 2 classes with the learning & content of barely 1/3 of what s/b expected</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2005<br>Class Name: MGMT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>STAY AWAY! Hours of homework, quizzes 5 minutes to the end of the class (very detailed), reads off the slides, major project, hard midterm (she expects you to know EVERYTHING in the book, yet no review).

I sometimes feel that she does not know how to do what she is teaching us. Too much Homework too big of a project which is vague, and she loves Wrigleys, take her if you love Wrigleys too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's new to teaching, inexperienced, gives 2 hours of homework each day and quiz at the end of EVERY class, HUGE mid-term, HUGE final. No people skills, NOT a good teacher, just reads the slides to you, indifferent, not helpful, goes on about her old job at Wrigleys, WORST of all shes not even hot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: MGT<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very hard with high expectations! She gives too much homework and quizzes at the end of each class. There are no reviews before tests as she expects you to know everything in the book!</div></div></div></body></html>
