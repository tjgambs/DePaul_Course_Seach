It's hard to be sure what you are supposed to do, and sometimes, even when it is due. She'll change the syllabus on you, test you on things she said she would not, and does not teach anything, really. Just lets students form groups and teach each other. Disorganized. Avoid.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2013<br>Class Name: HTHC521RECC5<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Need more balance between concepts we are going to be tested on and personal case studies.

It was an easy A, but I didn't learn much about health communication. She is very unclear about assignments and the only way to reach her is via phone. She does not use D2L or email or text. Not very communication savvy for a communication professor</div></div></div></body></html>
