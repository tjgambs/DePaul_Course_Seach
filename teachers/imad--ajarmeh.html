Speech hard to understand, unclear, ambiguous sometimes. can't get his point. Ambiguous homework too, vague description. He hates to be asked about grading and grades tough. Refused to let us know midterm average. Avoid him unless you want to mess up your GPA. Although I got A-, I and many of us think we deserve better grade</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2015<br>Class Name: 568<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid this professor at all costs. Very hard to understand and does not like to be challenged regarding his grading and clarity of questions. He made us memorize MIB names and OID objects! Why?? No one is going to remember that stuff everyone just looks it up. Completely useless. By far the worst professor I have encountered at DePaul. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2015<br>Class Name: 568<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>RUN ,, will not respond to your email  Arrogant </div></div></div></body></html>
