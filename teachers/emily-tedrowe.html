She is always there to help if you go in during office hours or make an appointment. She created a positive class environment which is great for workshopping. I would definitely recommend her class to anyone.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't realize this class was about writing so many essays! Go to class everyday because she takes attendance. Read all the novels. Participate. Write papers. Take midterm. Write more papers. Then peer edit papers. Then re-write your papers. Then write it again. Basically, WRITE. Good thing is all your writing pays off. Its your final. Good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2014<br>Class Name: ENG218<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the worst teacher I EVER had! I am a junior & English is my life. After taking this class I just want to change majors. It's not a hard class but if you do not understand something you better go ask another professor or go to the writing center because she is no help. She doesn't allow bathroom breaks. She also seems so nice but isn't. EVIL</div></div></div></body></html>
