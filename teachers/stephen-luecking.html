How does an old story of a Mayan temple relate to a 3D space?  It turned out to make sense when I understood their 'key stones'.  And developed my very own 3D model, unfolded it, and built it out of paper. Can we say, 'structural integrity'</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/17/2012<br>Class Name: GPH259<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very intelligent man, horrible professor. No organization, very unclear with requirements (always changing). Difficult to follow lectures making learning nearly impossible. Didn't show up to 2 classes. Purposefully bent grades to achieve a class bell-curve. Worst experience at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/27/2011<br>Class Name: GPH259<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I contemplate violence towards whoever 10-yeared this prof. He sounds like the teacher in &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot; ... Brilliant man, horrible teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/20/2010<br>Class Name: GPH211<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy. Unfortunately this class consisted of mindumbingly detailed, time consuming and more importantly, time WASTING exercises. First half of the course, we did graphics work in MICROSOFT WORD (yes, you read that correctly). The work's not hard, it's just irrelevant and not worth the effort. Learned maybe one or two new (minor) things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2008<br>Class Name: HON225<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>While he seemed like a nice person, as a professor he just wasn't organized or clear with anything.  No one in our class knew what we were supposed to be doing, he didn't respond to emails and didn't show up for the midterm.  Overall, what could have been an interesting class became a major headache.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2007<br>Class Name: GPH259<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a very kind prof. Pretty easy on grading but I'd say his exams were shorter and harder than expected. You just need to follow the instructions carefully when working on the assignments. His class was boring but he usually let us out early. Do your best on all the assignments and just pay attention on the exam reviews and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2007<br>Class Name: GPH250<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ehhhhhhh..... he was nice and all, but I wouldn't take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2005<br>Class Name: VARIOUS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I will never forgive the destruction of my work that took me out of applying for grad school.  Its taken me almost 8 years to get over it.  Sorry, he might be a nice guy but he held partial responsibility for this action.  Never received even an apology.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: GPH<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Have you ever gotten trapped in a conversation with your uncle about meaningless crap&#63;  This is a 90 minute class resembling this mindnumbing feeling. I hate to say it... the guy is really nice afterall. Anyway i'd still take the class again, since it gets you the lab credit at the loop campus.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2004<br>Class Name: GPH<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A well recognized genius with a kind personality. And a karate practitioner on top of that. Although he will go off on wild tangents in the middle of a lecture, and will make you cut things out of paper, definitely a good professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/12/2004<br>Class Name: GRAPHICAR<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2004<br>Class Name: GPH212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the most knowledgeable professors I have had. He's nice a nice guy. Sometimes he goes off on tangents that don't pertain to the class.  The projects take a long time and but are mostly busy-work and are worth it once you are done. he was MIA twice</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2004<br>Class Name: GPH259<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Brilliant and inspiring.  He's very passionate about art as a whole and will go into detail about anything if you're willing to hear.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2004<br>Class Name: GPH212<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Boring at times, but informative.  Usually late for class and will let you out early.  But beware:  Do not take a night class with him!!</div></div></div></body></html>
