Very helpful in and out of class. Homework is helpful, but sometimes I feel that majority of it is irrelevant. It is an advanced speaking class, but not everyone is up to that level yet, especially to her expectations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2012<br>Class Name: CHN301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Jin is extremely helpful.  As you progress through your chinese studies she goes with you, so she tailors her lessons to the class.  She is somewhat demanding but overall an excellent teacher and I recommend her to anyone seriously interested in studying Chinese. Favorite teacher at DePaul hands down.</div></div></div></body></html>
