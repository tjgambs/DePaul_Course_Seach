    Dr. Boutot has great teaching and research experience working with students who receive special ed. She makes the topic fun, interesting, and surprisingly lighthearted. In addition, she caters to people's different learning styles by letting you choose your own projects to earn points in the class. I would take her for another class.

    I really enjoyed Dr. Boutot's class. She is very knowledgeable about Special Ed, really gets people interested in the topic, and has a good mix of group work and actual teaching in her class. Plus, I enjoyed the flexibility of being able to choose which projects I wanted to do. She was extremely clear on assignments.

    I enjoyed class with Dr. Boutot this past quarter. She is new to Chicago, but she brings a lot of experience from her previous educational experiences. She is clearly passionate about Special Education. One nice thing - she gives you some choice in how you will earn points for the class, in terms of choosing projects. Great teacher.
