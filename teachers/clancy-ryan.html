Not only does he show you how to apply sales to everyday jobs, but also how to nail the interview, get promoted, and sell to anyone. He gives great advice and is extremely helpful in any situation. He will also come before class and stay late to help anyone. Take his class!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2014<br>Class Name: MKT377<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>All he would like you to do is raise money for this class.

How difficult you find this class to be will rely on whether you can tolerate Clancy's style or not. Me, it gave me headaches. And I don't mind cursing but he seems to go a bit overboard with his comedian schtick. Easy classwork, brutal lectures.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/14/2013<br>Class Name: MKT377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher and best class I've had at DePaul.

Complete waste time for my last quarter here, learned nothing.  Have no interest in sales, it is just a class to sell the Sales and Leadership Program, Period. easy but such bs, and he is an unfair grader.

He's not experienced enough to be a professor. He enjoys making fun of students. He doesn't explain any of the paper/project/presentation, and when I asked questions about them he made me feel dumb. Shove that clicker up your @$$ clancy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/03/2006<br>Class Name: MARKETING<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher with lots of experience in this field.

If you work a REAL job, the class and his lessons are definitely applicable.  Just listen in class and work on your project in the beginning and you will get the grade you deserve.

His class is really easy, take it for an easy grade. He sometimes makes fun of students in front of everyone which I found to be rude at times. I would reccommend you take Jeannie Sticher (same class, just a diff. professor) she seems genuinely nice. Good luck.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2005<br>Class Name: MKT398<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A high school caliber teacher that has his select favorites in class & Makes sure you are all very very aware who his favorite students are. Extremely childish behavior that is quite unusual from DePaul professors.  basically, he is a used car salesman trying to convince you to buy into all his bs, believe that. Interesting class though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: MARKETING398<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Ryan talks about how the class is up to you to learn as many skills as you can.  Certainly the class seems easy if you just sit through it and do not participate.  The class was all about taking what the teacher taught and applying it to your work/life.  Thanks for all the useful information Clancy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: MKT398<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I do not like him, he thinks he is so funny and cute, but really he is just annoying.  I found this class to be a waste of time, he is just up there the whole time talking about his girlfriend and his gay cell phone games company like anyone cares.  Take this class for an easy A, but don't fall for the hype-- HE ISN'T THAT GREAT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2005<br>Class Name: MKT398<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a cool teacher to have and the experience is worth taking the class. He does tend to pick favorites and makes it obvious who those people are. All in all though, a good teacher and you'll learn a lot from taking his class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2004<br>Class Name: MKT398<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Clancy's class is REALLY easy.
