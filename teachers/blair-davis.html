    Loved this class, Blair is great. He set up a skype interview with actor + producer from Young and the Restless for our Soap Operas class and it was amazing. He really cares about students. Definitely take his classes.

    I had never taken a film class before and after the first class I was intimidated BUT Blair is AWESOME! He is such a nice sweet guy! He always brought us snacks and kept the energy high which is so important for a night class.  He's really fun but just slightly hard. No tests, just two papers.

    Blair knows an awful lot about his subject, and he presents the material in a nuanced, engaging manner.  He really cares about his students as well.  Great professor, highly recommended
