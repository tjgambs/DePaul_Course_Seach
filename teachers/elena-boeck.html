I really enjoyed her class. You can't use technology whatsoever and at first, this annoyed me but her personality won me over. One easy term paper and the midterm and final are open note for the essay portion which was great. Definitely take her for a religion credit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2015<br>Class Name: HON205<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>too much reading, won't let you go to the bathroom, eat even a granola bar, had to ask for assignment requirements (page length, sources, etc), knows a lot but is very condescending, would never ever take again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2015<br>Class Name: CTH252<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>She has a wonderful personality and great credentials to go along with her vast knowledge and passion for Byzantine Art. Class was thoroughly interesting and the subject was worth the amount of reading. DON'T FALL ASLEEP IN CLASS! What she says in the lectures are helpful in regurgitating them on a midterm or final. Attendance is important. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/17/2013<br>Class Name: HA222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Boeck is fantastic! She really knows her stuff and makes lectures interesting and enjoyable with her smart sense of humor. She is very helpful, friendly, and understanding.

The class is interesting and she backes sure to give useful examples and is always willing to give guidance on papers, exam prep, and tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/13/2012<br>Class Name: HAA222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>In a sea of many amazing professors, Dr. Boeck is superior to any and all. Caring, thoughtful, and dedicated, she is everything that academia should be. She exudes intelligence and knowledge, yet makes both accessible to all students. Is she tough? Sure, sometimes. But she expects the best and will teach you much if you're dedicated.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2012<br>Class Name: CTH252<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was really good and usefull, the mid term and final are curved based on the other students in the class, I got an A and am not an art history major.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/21/2011<br>Class Name: HAA230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Makes lectures fascinating and informative (about subject matter that could be mind-numbingly dull in the wrong hands). You can tell she's brilliant but she knows how to bring down her academicism to a relatable level without dumbing it down. She's funny without trying hard to be funny. Plus her Russian accent is adorable. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2011<br>Class Name: HAA230<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love, Love, LOVE this professor!!! She is fun & highly intelligent. She cares about the subject matter & explains it in a way that makes it interesting. She also has a wonderful personality and cracks jokes a lot. She also makes every student feel &quot;ok&quot; with asking questions because she always responds with &quot;that's an excellent question.&quot; Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2011<br>Class Name: HAA234<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable, and extremely helpful. Passionate about her work and the students. expects hard work and is somewhat strict at times. do not text in class! but keeps a subject that would be dry very amusing and inspires interest. Great professor and educator</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/20/2011<br>Class Name: HAA222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome teacher, she is very passionate about what she teaches and it gets the students' interests.

She is strict and rightfully so because students who genuinely want to learn about Art deserve to learn! Passionate about her subject, her lectures are always amusing and her powerpoints are of good quality. Your classmates may intimidate you if they are upper-classmen Art History majors. Homework: Normal</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2009<br>Class Name: HAA231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgable about the subject. Extremely hard grader on the 7-10 page paper you do. I suggest turning it in for review before its due. Powerpoint lectures. Lot of material to memorize. Midterm and Final are not too bad. Weekly 1pg assignments. Gives ample extra credit. Takes attendance every class. Textbook so expensive but barely even use it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2008<br>Class Name: ART240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wasn't looking forward to taking another Art class but have to say she really made the class interesting. I will say that she is a hard grader. There is a major paper in the class and I recommend getting it reviewed by her before turning it in. Other than that she is a great teacher and probably the best art teacher. Gave lots of extra credit!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2008<br>Class Name: ART240<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This was a really hard class but she really knows her stuff. She offers extra credit and can be lenient on exams. I took this class as a freshman and everyone else in it was a junior or senior. Be Prepared to work hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/30/2007<br>Class Name: ART251<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took ART 251 Islamic Art with Dr. Boeck, it was kind of difficult but if you do everything she says its not hard to get an A She is really nice and a great teacher just a lot of information but it was interesting!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2007<br>Class Name: ART251<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I tried hating her but i just couldn't. The fact is she is a little tough, but not unreasonably. Classesare strict but u end up learning a lot. All lectures are powerpnt.musthave good memory of architecture. Be prepared to work alittle but u'll get a lot out of the class. Midterm, Final Paper, wkly discussion paper/notes and 7-10 pg research paper.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/08/2006<br>Class Name: ART240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very inelegant, knowledgeable; she makes you think. there should be more professors like her at Depaul. i strongly recommend to take her.

She is really very helpful and knows so much and keeps the lecture going strong.  Everything she says is interesting.  She can make a random subject like Cave drawings or a Byzantine Icon so interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: ART233<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It felt like I was inside the Discovery Channel! She is THE epitome of an awesome foreign professor, and for once lectures did not seem boring since she was so excited about the subject matter. Only take if you're willing to take the time to learn.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2006<br>Class Name: ART240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, hands down. Her class is very tough, and there's lots of writing involved, but if you actually pay attention you'll pass. She's very nice and she actually isn't that tough of a grader. You just have to be willing to work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/24/2005<br>Class Name: ART240<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Before enrolling in her class,I had looked at this site.She is EXTREAMLY professional,which is a good thing to have in a professor.She knows her stuff well and despite what others say about her accent,I was able to hear her CLEARLY.She is completely willing to help her students.Ask for help if you need it.Alot of reading, but overall great teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2005<br>Class Name: ART397<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is the best professor at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2005<br>Class Name: ART240<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is knowledgeble, but has accent, which makes it very difficult to understand her and she says &quot;ladies and gentelmen&quot; billion times per class.  She expects you to be on time for class, but she is never on time.  Don't take her if you have any other option.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2005<br>Class Name: ARTHISTORY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is so nice and helpful.  the class is meant for those students who are willing to work hard. her lectures are very interesting and she has a good sense of humor. be prepared to read a lot and write one paper per week.  the homework doesn't seem so bad because the she makes you actually want to learn about the subject</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2005<br>Class Name: ART<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I liked her a lot. She cared about her students and was particularly clear about the assignments and so forth. Gave plenty of time for tests and papers. Someone said they couldn't understand her accent&#63; LOL. It wasn't that difficult- she speaks fine. Cracks me up the amount of time she says &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen.&quot; Overall I think she was great.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2005<br>Class Name: ART233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Boeck is definitely one of the best teachers at DePaul.  She is VERY professional and CARES about her students.  I would even recommend her for non-art majors.  There are weekly papers and 2 larger ones, on top of a midterm and final.  However, the class is manageable.  I would definitely take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2005<br>Class Name: ART233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful and professional.

Good memorization skills help.  More weekly HW than most art classes at DePaul.
