Her grading is often incorrect- check you assignments.  I left with a 95 which for her was an A-.  She wasn't willing to work anything out.  Worked too hard in the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2006<br>Class Name: PSY368<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is VERY nice and sweet.  She's also so helpful if you need anything or extra time.  The homework is very resonable and there are no tests!  The course packet sucks.  The lectures are very very boring, the class seems so long.  She's a pretty easy grader.  I just wish the class was more interesting, or she had more energy about the subject</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class was EASY! Attendance was 40% of your grade. All you had to do was show up and participate in easy class discussions. Tests were easy and didn't need to be studied for.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2005<br>Class Name: PSY345<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>so nice and really knows what she is talking about</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: PSYCHOLOGY368<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When I asked her for clarificiation on how to approach an ambiguous assignment she replied that it was not fair for her to give me help and not the other students.

She's so sweet and nice and innocent. It's deceiving because this lady knows her****. Highly successful in her field. She's fun and giggles at stupid things, which made class interesting.Plus, class was pretty common sense based</div></div></div></body></html>
