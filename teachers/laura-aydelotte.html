I did all the readings but really did not comprehend it all. It was very easy to blank out during her lectures because she talks so quietly. This is the kind of class you just forget about when it's done.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2013<br>Class Name: ENG328<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The deal with Aydelotte and Shakespeare is that SHE LOVES him, but her obsession doesn't translate and make you care about him. Her classwork and assignments are do-able, but it's hard to please her in the papers because she has a high standard of how to talk about her boy Billy, and if you get it wrong you're out of luck.</div></div></div></body></html>
