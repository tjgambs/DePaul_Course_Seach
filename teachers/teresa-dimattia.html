The class is pretty tough because of lots of assignments. We never had a day without a homework. Couple of presentations, lots of group work, various cases.. Participation is highly recommended. Overall, interesting class, but you have to study. Lots of research and writing. It's not hard but time consuming. I'd take her agn</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/29/2010<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The comment below me is a total lie..because I got an A in the class, and I knew about 5 other people that did as well. Her class is really easy if you pay attention and study all of your notes. Not a GPA ruiner at all, some people are just really bitter..</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2010<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TO SAVE YOUR GPA DO NOT TAKE HER -- The highest grade in our entire class was a C. Even the students with 4.0's could not get higher than a C. Her class is designed not to pass, just one of those prof. Honestly, take the other instructor. She must comment on her own site because she is simply the worst instructor... you wont learn/pass her class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2010<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't get the negative remarks on here at all..maybe some people just didn't study&#63; She's a very fair grader and assignment giver. The class information is interesting and relevant if you want to be a CPA. I reviewed her slides the night before exams, got A's. Really not a difficult class, there's a lot of group work but it's not too bad.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2009<br>Class Name: ACC350<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have a feeling the only positive remarks on this site are made by the professor herself. She has the class teach instead of her. You will study 30hrs a week and still not pass this class. If you are at this level of acc you know how to study and study hard. She clearly is the reason DePaul's fine students are not doing as well as they could!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2009<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accounting is a tough subject for most. Dimattia is by far the best ACC prof I've had.  Go to class and take notes no matter how boring it is. Most importantly DO ALL THE HOMEWORK and then do it again before the MT and Final. Use the weekly quizes to stay on top of the material and boost your grade. I got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2009<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is clearly a skilled accountant, but an absolutely awful teacher. The whole class period is her clicking through slides in the most boring way possible, literally teaching nothing. You will not learn from her - you need to learn the material yourself. In addition, our class had a midterm average of 58%, so clearly her tests are absurd as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/18/2008<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>n/a</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2008<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accounting is something you have to learn through practice, you can't just get a lecture from a teacher and expect to know the stuff for the test. She's not the best teacher but not the worst, however she is awesome when it comes to getting extra help. take her!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2008<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Difficult class was made easy by the practice problems assigned for hw. Class is poorly structured as the final is 45% but it is easier than the midterm. Prof is available lots for additional help!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: ACC102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Accounting isn't easy, but this professor does little to make it any easier. Teaches straight from the book's Powerpoint slides and expects an intense amount of homework to be done (only 5% of your grade, too) while the midterm, final and four quizzes make up the rest. She's a nice lady, but not an effective teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: ACCT102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!!!!!!!! FINAL WAS 85% OF GRADE.  SHE DOESNT KNOW HOW TO TEACH!  WASTE OF MONEY, WASTE OF TIME!  THIS CLASS IS BRUTAL!! I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE HER!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
