Loves what she teaches and makes learning it bearable. I took her lab and am so grateful I had her to fill the requirement. I would highly recommend her and I hope to take her again to fulfill the rest of my science domains.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2013<br>Class Name: ENV102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took this class to fill my lab requirement, and it was perfect. I'm a business major, so I don't really like science, but this class was interesting, and Beth understood that most people in the class weren't science majors, so she wasn't too harsh with grades. I would recommend this class!</div></div></div></body></html>
