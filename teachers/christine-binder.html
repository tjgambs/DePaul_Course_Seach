At the same time, you have to apply yourself in this class and put in your own work to get out of it what you need to.  She gives us the tools to be better, but takes a hands off approach once we know the basics.  Amazing lectures and an ability to tie in real world experiences with class work.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2011<br>Class Name: LIGHT12<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Uninterested if your good, a mommy if your a tard. She is more interested in making people feel warm and fuzzy than kicking your butt to become a better designer. Also more focused on simple PPW stuff rather than overall design, also she didnt come to some of my big shows.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2005<br>Class Name: LIGHTINGDESIGN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
