She was not very nice either. She seemed to give attitude and had favorites in her class. If you wanted to have your input, you had to be constantly engaged in her class otherwise she will never call on you. I honestly hate political science and did not find her helpful in helping me like it anymore.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome young teacher! Has a lot of knowledge in politics and current events, and she's good with helping you outside of class. Not a hard grader in terms of papers, but her tests ARE a little tricky. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2010<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was awesome. She gives you chances for extra credit gives you reading but you discuss it all in class. She teaches through power points and puts them online the midterm and final come directly from them. 2 easy papers as well. awesome teacher!! loved her. I got an A. I'd take her again for sure.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2010<br>Class Name: PSC120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Straight up powerpoint lectures. she literally reads out of slides and talks about off topic stuff way too much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2009<br>Class Name: PSC222<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>New & Younger Prof. Enjoyed her class immensely.
