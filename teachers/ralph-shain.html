If you asked him to talk more about the material, he was very willing to do so - he just wasn't going to do his students' work for them, which is ultimately for the students own benefit.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2004<br>Class Name: PHL<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is the worst teacher.
