Her explanations are very clear and she's very willing to help you. Only two tests, two quizzes..not too bad. Highly recommend her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/04/2005<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>VERY GOOD TEACHER THE BEST THAT I HAVE ECER HAD VERY PATIENT AND EXPLAINS THINGS VERY WELL</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2005<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Only a nightclass is available becasue she is a high school teacher, thats right high school. that should explain it all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2005<br>Class Name: MAT101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved her!  She made things so clear and explains stuff well.  She's very patient and helpful, an all-around great teacher.  Bonus: She always let us leave early and the homework is totally reasonable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: MATH101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher!

The cool part is that she let's you use notes and homework assignments on your quizzes because the quizzes have the homework problems in them.  A definite must take if you need the class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/09/2004<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy, a little hard to follow. He tries to explain things so deeply that it ends up going over your head. Easy to get an A if you use his grading to your advantage.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2004<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall the class wasn't terribly hard and he erases your lowest test score out of 3 & he always curves tests. However, expect to be confused during lecture because he is a very intelligent man and goes beyond your understanding sometimes. If you take this class make sure you understand the material</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2004<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly intelligent and he knows what he is doing.  The tests are very challenging and he's too smart to actually teach well.  If you ask for extra help, you will do better on the tests. His lectures are boring, confusing, and he never gets around to teaching actual problems.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2004<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's the best nap Depaul's tuition could provide. You'll never understand what he's talking about. He's too intelligent to talk to us.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2004<br>Class Name: MAT170<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He seems like a nice teacher and is willing to help out with problems but he takes too long on single problems and runs out of time to teach another session...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/10/2004<br>Class Name: GEO<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard.
