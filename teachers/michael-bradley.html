His class is very easy and the tests come straight from the weekly quizzes he gives. The big thing is the final paper, which he grades pretty easily on.

Fr. Bradley is easy, but also is very kind and helpful. You have to do a bit of reading, because you will have quizzes, but class is easy to sit through, and fairly interesting. You take a few field trips which was  a blast.  MidTerm and Final are not bad. Take this class for your Rel requirement.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2005<br>Class Name: THEOLOGY<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Father Bradley is a wonderful teacher and a great example of a Christian that lives his faith in all his activities.
