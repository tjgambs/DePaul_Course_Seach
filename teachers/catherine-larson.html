    Dr. Larsen is very passionate and knowledgeable.  She mixes things up.  She often put the student in the place of their future students.  She engages like no body's business.  She's professional and awesome!

    This class was very tedious. She was enthusiastic, but often times unclear with her assignments. Alot of us would leave class feeling so overwhelmed and confused. She was an extremely hard grader of lesson plans. Just a headache, overall.

    I absolutely love her, she makes class so much fun and very helpful. All the assignments are clear and directly related to the things we do in class. We DO everything, which makes it a lot more memorable of an experience. I would definitely reccommend this class! :)

    Professor Larsen is extremely nice and helpful. She always looks out for her students best interests. You learn new and interesting ways to integrate the arts into your lessons. Plus We get to do some of those lessons, which can be pretty fun, especially the art ones! I think she is a great professor.

    Dr. Larsen is one of the best professors I had at DePaul.  Her assignments are very useful if you end up in a music classroom.  I hope the school of education appreciates her because the school of music is missing out on a first class teacher.  Thank you, SoM for your continued lack of concern for individuals and continued concern for money.

    She plays favorites and grades accordingly. She knows nothing about teaching, or how to prepare teachers. All of her lectures and activities revolve around singing, since that's her area of interest. One of the most awful teachers ever!
