    It's not very hard to get an A as long as you read your assigned readings and study a few hours a week.

    She's very understanding, friendly and knowledgeable. She's willing to help you out on your spare time. She gives you a list with all the possible assignments and with your possible grade. Basically based off the assignments you choose to do, get you the grade you want. I highly remcommend her!

    Sucked.  Tried so hard to make things interesting but would always just make things complicated.  Her readings were boring and she never really &quot;taught&quot; she had us present and get in groups and talk about what we read.  Unbelievably boring and had too much work that was unecessary

    The whole class was a bunch of nonsense. The three text books were a bunch of nonsense. She's a feminist that likes to talk in an incoherent language. It's true you can choose what assaignments to do, and can predict your grade based off of that. BUT A RIDICULOUS AMOUNTS OF POINTS ARE NEEDED FOR AN A. THIS CLASS WAS A ROYAL WASTE OF MY TIME.
