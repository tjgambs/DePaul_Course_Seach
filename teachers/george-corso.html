It is a 100 level class yet he treats it like it's 300 level. If you want to pass the tests, read everything about the topic i.e. notes, books, even online resources and even then, it is still an extremely difficult class. He is also incedibly dry and an unfair grader. Do not take as an SI elective!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2011<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ridiculously boring.

I had to pull off my eyelashes just to make sure I was still alive in his class.  His grading is very hard, however the extra credit saved me. Two quizzes, two finals.

He really knows his stuff and his grading policy is fair. All people have to do in his class is study the study guide and take notes, and you'll do fine. I don't know why some people put such bad reviews about him, they probably never studied. I learned alot more than I thought I would.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/09/2009<br>Class Name: PHY204<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>* he looks like Gimli the dwarf from lord of the rings. He is the most boring teacher on the planet, he makes an interesting subject unbearable. There is an art to teaching, he does not possess it. There is a stark difference in knowing and being able to teach.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/31/2009<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy class.

He's very smart, but he's not a very good presenter of what he's saying, strays from the point a lot, but has easy tests. Frankly though, this is the norm of what you'll find as far as science instructors go.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2009<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>To get a A in his class you really have to know EVERYTHING he teaches.

Two quizzes, a midterm, and a NONCUMULATIVE final. If you write a five page term paper you can get 20 extra credit points, and more are offered by going to the planetarium. He gives you study guides & has reviews. Not hard to get an A at all. Lectures are boring though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Corso is a knowledgeable professor, you just have to get used to his teaching style. The class is easy enough to get through if you read, take notes, and study the diagrams because you will have to draw and discuss them. He offers up to 30 pts extra credit. You can definitely take advantage of that if you screw up on one of his exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2008<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow.. Just took the final. my A has now dropped to a low B/C+ unless he curves this damn thing. Unnecessarily difficult final exam on material he barely discussed and not clearly stated in the book.

His intro astronomy class is so easy IF you study EXACTLY what he tells you to study (study guide). For the essay portion of his exams: Just write down *verbatim* everything he says about the characteristics of the models on the syllabus. Yes, class is a bit boring, but you must go. This is college.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/01/2008<br>Class Name: PHY225<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Corso is a highly intelligent professor that obviously is interested in the subject matter he teaches.  He explains, clearly, exactly what he puts on the exams and his grading policy is fair. The people who didn't like him probably shouldn't be in college in the first place as they likely see college as purely an outlet to consume alcohol.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2008<br>Class Name: PHY104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class Structure: 300 Points Total.

Fill up the entire tests with writing ( he will give you an A, I rambled about politics on the back page and he didn't even bother reading it and gave me an A on the midterm).
