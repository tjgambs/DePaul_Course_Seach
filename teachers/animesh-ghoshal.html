He is an expert in his field, brings in interesting speakers, and - above all - he respects his students.  He shows this respect by providing quality teaching, asking for feedback, encouraging participation, and challenging you to think like an economist.  I highly recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2013<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>EXCELLENT "teacher", not simply lecturing throughout classes, teaching concepts and applying those concepts to individuals' professional work experience.

He "demonstrates" examples on the boar, but it's all just scribbles. Also, he rushes through everything and expects you to learn it all. I wish I could have dropped this class, but it seemed like an easy and interesting class the first 2 weeks. :( .</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2013<br>Class Name: ECO361<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I took him as my Global Perspective class at DePaul. He is a very solid professor all around and I was impressed with how prepared he came to class and how serious he took the learning process. A lot of interesting speakers from all over the world came.

He related content to real world, Showed necessary work for solving problems (even did calc review for half a class), was interesting to listen to.  My one beef is that on the first exam, half of the class didn't finish in the time allowed, yet he did not curve the exam. If you like ECON, you'll learn a lot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2011<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very fair teacher.  Attendance is not mandatory but you'll want to attend every class.  Tests are taken from the notes and directly from practice problems he assigns.

He covers only what he teaches in class in his exams. Pay attention to his example in the class, he will ask you exactly from the examples.

Very clear lectures, but I felt sorry for classmates who didn't understand a concept on the first pass, because he flies through the slides with very little amount of time for questions. Midterm and Final all multiple choice, not too difficult. I'd take another class with him if I got the opportunity.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/15/2011<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Course is easy and the grade is good.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/14/2010<br>Class Name: ECO362<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Requires study of 9 HOURS EACH WEEK.

He seem arrogant so no hope that we could get any help outside of class. GOES SO FAST. If study by ourself why take class and WASTE money. I am dropping out rather getting low grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2010<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Ghoshal does the best he can do with a dry subject. His lectures are very clear and to the point, but can be slow at times. Grade is based on 2 tests, the questions for which are straightforward and taken directly from lectures and text. Overall, a good class. I'd take another class with him in the future.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/06/2010<br>Class Name: ECONS101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was  visiting prof in my school and he taught me Econs 101. He was so awesome. Clear , interactive, elaborative and supportive. Before attending the course, I had no interest in Econs (blame my bias:)) but he changed my mind about Econs:). It's pity that he won't come back to our school next year.

His class was very tough and he told the class right away that he expects 9 hours of work for us each week and he means it. If you're willing to put in the effort, you really learn a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2009<br>Class Name: ECO362<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far one of the best professors I've had a DePaul.  He's TOUGH, but you learn a lot of very useful material.  He also applies it to current events so you actually learn to understand what's going on in the world!

The class started out slow (short lectures) and ended fast (long lectures).  At the end of the course, the textbook material and the discussion in class are not congruent.  Material and anecdotes need modernizing to continue to be relevant to the audience.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2009<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tried to make boring class interesting.

May seem a bit dour and serious at first, but is still friendly and helpful. Exams were fair and relied on the lecture and notes more than the book.

Never had a professor be so ignorant about the way he grades and teaches. Takes off points for every little thing.

He is a very knowledgeable but can't teach. His exams were extremely difficult, he zips through the material too fast and the class is very boring. Take another professor otherwise you will be wasting your tuition dollars and barely pass this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/25/2007<br>Class Name: ECON555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart, but has no business teaching general core business classes for MBAs.  He should be teaching specialized Econ classes.  Tests were almost impossible, I had a tutor and often he moved so fast it was hard to keep up.  I wouldn't take him for Econ 555 but I guess if you are really into it, he might be good for specialized classes....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2007<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Ghoshal is an extremely skilled professor.

He's a very difficult grader. He doesn't really give partial credit.  His idea of partial credit is 1 out of 7 points for a math error.  And if you try to meet with him during office hours, he's no help - tells you it's in the book.  The worst professor I've had yet.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2007<br>Class Name: ECO555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Test questions came RIGHT FROM CLASS NOTES, but if you mess up one little detail, you loose major points.
