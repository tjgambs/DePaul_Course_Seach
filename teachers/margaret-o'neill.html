She goes through her slides so fast so you can't take notes. She waits until the night before an exam to put her slides up on Blackboard. Her tests are IMPOSSIBLE and test you on specific details of the book. She gives pop quizzes. Attendance is taken everyday. Save yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2009<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's an ok teacher, but she is engaged in teaching. Attendance is mandatory and she says that notes are required, but everything she uses is in the textbook. She posts her presentations on Blackboard before tests. There are three in the quarter, a final paper, and a few writing assignments. Very easy stuff. I recommend if you need an easy grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2009<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is terrible. Don't take this professor. She was late for class all the time (she was 20 minutes late for our final!), her lectures were boring, and she was very condescending. Her class wasn't difficult but she's just not a good teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/19/2008<br>Class Name: CMN102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was awful. She gives awful powerpoints, and most of the time will click to the next slide before you are done. She isn't very approachable, and has boring excercises. Every class was a chore and I never looked forward to one. This class will test one's mandatory attendance policy. Do not take her class.</div></div></div></body></html>
