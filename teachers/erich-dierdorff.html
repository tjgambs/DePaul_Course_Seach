    New format for 2 credit hours - a lot of useful information. Lectures relate to real life and examples help to keep the info.  The style of delivery is monologue with fill in blanks. Re-enforces the material through short quiz. Material is presented clearly and with care. Take it with him.

    Good class with lots of work. 5 activities (small HW) and 2 paper to submit + 2 exams. The exams are kinda tricky . He will help you if you ask and he keeps this class interesting with stories, in class activates and videos. Take him for MGT 555.

    Great prof, easily top 2 I've had and I'm over half way through my MBA.  If you want an A in the intersession format and you work full-time, get ready to put in a decent amount of time to study outside of class.  Wish Dr. D taught other general MGT classes. Definitely recommended.

    Took this class in a compressed format, 6 hours of lecture on Saturdays.  Dr Dierdorff kept the class lively and interesting and kept me engaged throughout.  His use of clickers, examples, and humor make the class very enjoyable and promotes a learning environment.  This is the professor to take for MGT555!

    Best professor that I've ever had at DePaul! It is very clear that he knows the subject material quite well, and that he actually cares about his students' development. I've learned a lot in the course - I think a lot of other professors have a lot to learn from him.

    Best professor ever. I have taken both MGT 555 and MGT 525 and I wish he had more classes to take him again. His class is strongly based on studies and evidence-based management. Book is important but not essential. He is very knowledgeable and an amazing instructor. If you study his notes and follow his instructions you will be fine.

    For what I consider a boring class, he did an amazing job.  Very thorough, and keeps the class interesting.  Would not take any other professionl for 555 from what I have heard from other students.

    Went into this class expecting a good, smart professor and that is what I got.  Dr. D is sharp, entertaining and knows his stuff.  I really enjoyed his class.  I did not understand all the hoopla about him being &quot;hot&quot; at first. But after ahile he seriously grew on me... He has a lot of charisma and charm.  Take him and you won't regret it!

    Dr. Dierdorff is a great prof who is constantly trying to improve his teaching. (And it shows.) He provides statistical analyst on all of his topics to support his opinions and is crystal clear about his assignments.  Not an easy A but certainly a fair teacher.  I would highly recommend him for any class.

    Good prof. Tough grader, but I suppose he's fair. He may take HR a little too seriously, but that's okay. Just float his ego a bit and youll get a long way in his class...

    Dr. D, is the best professor at DePaul, period. In the many classes I have taken at DePaul, I think only his classes were structured and had clarity. He not only has a fantastic breadth and depth of knowledge, but his ability to transfer knowledge to students is amazing. Great professor and a good person. Great going  Dr. D.

    Take Dierdorff.  He's an awesome professor (and he knows it, but that's ok).  Classes are highly entertaining but you still learn a lot. Keeps you engaged.  I-clickers are fun.  Hey Dr. D, lay off the school a little.. you're going to jade us. haha

    Dr. Dierdorff was his usual entertaining self.  He's a great lecturer and delivers information in an interesting way.  Good course content.  I-clicker usage keeps things lively.  Class included a large group project (w/presentation) and final.  Excellent professor and a good class.  Very highly recommended.

    Dr Dierdorff is hands down the best TEACHER I have had including undergrad. He gauged class comprehension via iClicker (use should be mandatory school-wide), so we spent more time on subjects needing more attention. The guy knows what he's talking about &amp; his resume proves it. He cares that students learn &amp; does not talk down to them. 12/08 course

    Fantastic professor! His lectures are clear, concise and relevant to today's business world. There are a lot of good takeaways from this class. The class was a little easy, but I still learned a lot -- so, seems like a win-win, eh&#63; My only regret is that I took the class in a shortened period -- probably could have learned a lot more otherwise!

    Dr. D. is a great professor.  He keeps his classes lively with humor and electronic voting exercises.  He teaches the important concepts and doesn't get lost in the details.  Never got bored in his class.  I wish it went on longer. His personality and demeanor are unique among professors.  Final was straight-forward and easy.  Highly recommended.

    HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Hands down the best professor I've taken at DePaul. Dr. D knows his subject matter, comes well prepared, engages students, is quick to help and very fair. He is a diamond in the rough and I was impressed by his lectures. You will learn in this class, and not because it's &quot;easy&quot;, but because he makes you want to learn. Awesome!

    This class is pretty easy.  There are a couple assignments but he is an easy grader.  The tests are straight out off the reviews the week before.  The book overlapse the class enough so you can either go to class or read the book.  I found going to class a little easier.

    I highly recommend Dr. Dierdorff's MGT 555: It's fun, informative and relevant, moving quickly, but efficiently.  Diversified format is engaging. Dr. Dierdorff is organized, knowledgeable, responsive and very helpful; obviously interested in his subject.  Oh, and handsome -- give this man some chili peppers!

    The condensed class is the way to go if you can.  He managed to keep my attention during the 7 hours of teaching which is a true skill.  He understands that most students are not going to be HR professionals and ensures that you understand the basics.  His still is laid back, very helpful.  dont need the text much but have to attend class.

    Awesome Professor, a mix between Morgan Spurlock and Bill Maher!  Lectures are very interesting and are full of business related material.  His exams are fair, study your notes.  Plus he likes to read his ratings in class!  Highly Recommend.

    Dr. Dierdorff uses a lot of different techniques (e.g., video clips, exercises, lecture, personal anecdotes, etc.) in his teaching, which makes the material much easier to learn and enjoy. Highly recommended! He's a fair grader, and genuinely wants his students to succeed.

    Prof. Dierdorff's teaching methods helped make a Saturday class interesting and challenging. It's a lot of work, but you learn a lot of useful information about HR was as before if you work in Corporate America, HR sometimes gets a bad wrap. Dr. Dierdorff will tell you it's not valid to say this, but he is HOT!!!

    Dr. Dierdorff is a great professor.  There is a decent amount of work for this class (textbook readings, articles, small assignments, two tests and two papers), but if you do the work, you'll get a good grade.  He is an excellent lecturer, and is very smart and knowledgeable.

    Very knowledgable professor.  Clearly articluates the class lessons and uses examples to show why lessons are relavant to the real world.  Tests are straight forward and based on the notes and handouts.  I did not use the textbook after week 2 and would not recommend buying it.  Class was enjoyable and I felt that the material was useful.

    Pretty interesting, but I would recommend that you do NOT take him on a Saturday course.  He goes through the information way to fast and nothing gets absorbed.  All you do is writting his notes down and not really listening to what he is saying.  Hard test.

    He is a great proff. Makes 3 hours go by fast. He is very interesting and has beautiful blue eyes!. He is very smart and makes no mistake in letting his students know it. There is a big group project and 2 tests. Easy homework. Tests are hard, just study his lecture notes and you'll get a B. PIck a good group to work with because the project is lon

    Awesome teacher, one of the best.  Class is not hard and he does make it fun.  All you have to do is study the notes (fill in the blank).  Plus you actually learn from it, not a waste of time like most classes.  He is really understanding and wants everyone to do well.  Take him if you can!
