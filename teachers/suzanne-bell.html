She uses personal experiences to explain her topics. On a personal level, she is not very considerate. It  is easy to get an A in this class but you have to work for it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2013<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her! Her lectures were interactive and they kept me interested. She is very good at explaining terms with examples. She was very clear with what was going to be on the midterm and final. If you know the study guide you will get an A. I would definitely recommend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2013<br>Class Name: PSY355<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had issues with this class as well as with professor Bell. If you didn't receive above an 80% on the midterm, or first test, you couldn't get an A in the class. The second half of the course was also almost entirely taught by other students through group presentations. Overall, I didn't learn much and didn't take Bell's "fun attitude" seriously.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/23/2012<br>Class Name: PSY355<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Very simple, practical and easy going. She gives a study guide and homework is just something you need to do, but not a hassle. Dr Bell is great. She is very motivating and wants everyone to do well.  Interesting class and very nice teacher.  Nothing else to say.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2012<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I lovee her!! TAKE THIS TEACHER. There are few assignments do turn them in! She wants everyone to do well in this class. Class is not mandatory however if you go (recommended) you don't even really need to crack the textbook just take notes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2011<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Enthusiastic about her class.  6 homework assignments that are easy if you follow directions.  Exams are easy if you study.  Constantly makes class interesting and fun.  Shes gorgeous too which helps and has some nice curves</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2011<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a good teacher but she grades tough. She is kind of picky on what you put in your hw assignments. She is definitely enthusiastic about teaching and will make the classes fun...Test are pretty hard too. I would recommend her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2011<br>Class Name: PSY100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I LOVE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2011<br>Class Name: MATH131<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher I have ever had, she wants everyone to do well and will go out of her way to do it, TAKE THIS TEACHER!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/11/2010<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tries to make class light and fun. Makes jokes. Homeworks are easy. There's 6 and she only takes 5. Midterm and final are kind of hard so you have to study. gives you study guides at least a week in advance though. attendance not mandatory</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2006<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sweet teacher, very knowledgable and helpful.

Print the slides off BB and do the reading - thats it! Papers are a breeze, just put some effort into them. Mult choice exams and she curves them...generously. I got a 100% A+ for the course! You really don't need to go to class, but i did anyway and sat in the front row cuz she is gorgeous! (I had a huge crush on her!!)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2006<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No attendance, 6 assignments (dropped the lowest grade), midterm and final (both multiple choice), study guide. I suggest that you get some use out of a CD that comes with the book.  Print the chapter outlines on the CD, print her slides, take some notes- an easy A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's really nice... not much to the class. just power points.6 assignments (drop the lowest grade) and midterm/final. i never read the book. just listen and take notes in class. study the notes and i got B's on the final/midterm. not hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>like everyone says she's sweet and easy.  He exams are ok just read the text.  Class is very boring and she teaches off pp.  I didn't come very often but did the work and did decent.  Take her it's a no big deal teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty easy teacher.  Entire class is raw memorization of material.  Tests aren't too bad.  I hardly studied, missed a few classes, never took notes and still got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is super nice. The notes from class can be found on blackboard, but you really don't need them. She doesnt take attendence--I missed quite a few classes and still got an A. Your grade rest heavily on how well you do on the exams(two,each worth 40% of your grade). I advise everyone to do the extra credit;it can boost your grade 1/3 i.e:B+ to A-</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/27/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>another powerpoint only professor.. except you cant just print it off of blackboard.  you have to WRITE IT ALL DOWN.  if you dont mind going to class every day because she does take attendance, at least in this class, then go for it.  but i was bored to tears.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2005<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first I was nervous but she turned out nice! She doesn't take attendence and provides you with the topics she will go over. Her homework is easy and not a lot and if you take her notes and listen to her examples her test are easy! A little boring but other then that not to bad!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2004<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not a bad professor and doesn't take attendance, but class is really boring.  She is an easy grader on homework but her tests are really difficult.  If you don't mind taking notes from a power point all hour then take her, she isn't that bad</div></div></div></body></html>
