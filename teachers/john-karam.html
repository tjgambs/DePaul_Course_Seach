He is very clear on his expectations, both on his commentaries that are due each class and on the papers.  Although the readings can be long, they are very interesting and essential. I learned so much from his class! If you attend class and do what is expected you will get a good grade. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Karam is an awesome guy and great for students who might not know a lot about a topic. He is very knowledgeable, uses a lot of examples, and makes things very clear for students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2014<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I would definitely recommend taking this course because overall professor Karam is an all around great professor.

I recommend him for any class. Super understanding, intelligent, and funny. Discussions are interesting if you do the reading, he'll keep class moving and he makes you think, really think. Class is all about the students and our thoughts and opinions. He likes to hear what we have to say.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/04/2013<br>Class Name: IWS220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Karam is so wonderful. He is incredibly patient with his students, pretty goofy at times, but never disappoints when providing incredibly insightful points to get discussion moving along. He's so incredibly smart but doesn't show it off and keeps the focus on the students. I actually wish he would show off a bit more to be honest. Great professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2013<br>Class Name: LST300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is awesome!!!! Very understanding and calm, and passionate about the material. Willing to listen to any new ideas and perspectives. He is BIG into research and will help you become a better thinker and analyzer. He also gets to know his students and their backgrounds... which made class much more enjoyable. Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>John Karam is a great professor! His lectures are thought provoking and I left class each day having learned something new and interesting. I loved his class and I would take another class with him! Highly highly recommended</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/05/2012<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Real nice guy. The class is pretty much a small ppt & a large discussion. There are 3 books you have to buy. There are readings every week & a 6-8 line commentary. If you regurtitate the main idea you'll be fine. He wil pick on you if you don't speak up or he hasn't heard from you in a while. Tolerable for those that don't like history.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2012<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's awesome! There are readings every week, but they aren't hard or long. You have to write a commentary for each reading (6-8 lines). For my final paper I just combined my commentaries all together. Your grade is based on your writing (commentaries and final) Go to class, you only meet 10 times and he takes attendance sometimes. He's ca-uute!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/10/2011<br>Class Name: LSP111<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Karam is a great teacher! He makes sure the students are understanding the material and is very helpful. However, he is a hard grader when it comes to writing. But to any student who is willing to challenge themselves in a new subject for greater knowledge, I would definitely recommend him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2011<br>Class Name: LST201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By far one of my favorite professors, he is funny and just makes you want to learn more. So much reading though but as long as you do it it is fine, group discussions are a must and he will call on you, so do not hide.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/06/2010<br>Class Name: LAS201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is awesome. He is really helpful and he is super nice. He does assign a lot of readings but its nothing too hard. Overall, he is a good teacher and the discussions are interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/26/2008<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy. TONS and TONS of readings. Many are unnecessary but he'll still question you about them. He picks on everyone in class; there is NO hiding from this guy. Overall he's a good professor. Likes to hear himself talk though so discussion + participation is a must. Watch out: He likes to play devils advocate.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2008<br>Class Name: LST203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was far most, the best professor I have taken at Depaul. He does require a lot of readings, but if u listen, take notes and participate in the discussions, you'll definately do well. He's very flexible, passionate and to top it off he's really HOT!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TONS of reading that i thought was unnecessary. mostly just does power points for his lectures and tries to promote discussions, but doesn't realize no one really cares. did two major papers and final paper and two short summaries of the readings each week. do what you're told, put in effort and you'll get a good grade!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2008<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>YES, THERE IS A LOT TO READ, HIS GRADE EASILY, HE THINKS WE DON'T LIFE, WAY TOO MUCH READING...YOU CAN GET AN &quot;A&quot; IF YOU DO THE ASSIGNED READING, DO ALL HIS HOMEWORK...NOT A HARD GRADER..YOU WILL DO GOOD, TRUST ME.............IF YOU DO WHAT HE TELLS YOU TO DO....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2008<br>Class Name: LST200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He gives A LOT of reading.  his assignements are unclear and he does not explian them further when you ask for help; he actually seems annoyed.  He does seem like a nice guy though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/02/2006<br>Class Name: LST201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was so great and taught me 2 much (good) about Latin American social struggles and culture. Be prepared to read a lot but everything is relevant to the essays which he basically outlines for you. Awesome teacher- quirky little Brazilian but funny :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2006<br>Class Name: LST201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice teacher overall, gives you a lot of reading material, and expects you to read it, but it helps for his essays. Two 4pged essays and a 10min ppt pres....not bad</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2006<br>Class Name: LTAMERICANST<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gives alot of readings, even when major papers are due.  Isn't very considerate of emergencies that happen outside of class.  Doesn't really teach...rather gives powerpoint presentations.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/11/2005<br>Class Name: LST200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. He pushes his students by giving A LOT of readings, discussion, etc. It's all worth while b/c the end results are positive.  He's always willing to help during his office hours and will talk about anything. His Portuguese accent is hot, but he can't pronounce a lot of the Spanish words.  YOU'LL LOVE HIS LAUGH & watch out for globe!</div></div></div></body></html>
