Overall, I felt that this class lacked structure and was mostly her talking nonsense.  For the final, she asks you to look over every powerpoint (about 30 slides per class) and gives little insight on what to focus on... ridiculous.  Also, weekly quizzes on books you have to reserve in the library.. no time for that!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2014<br>Class Name: MPS546<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She has poor classroom management skills. Everything was rushed because she let classmates talk so much about nonsense. We should have focused on the convoluted process of how a bill goes through and NOT jam pack the class with powerpoints and talking. Also daily homework is unnecessary and we are adults so making attendance mandatory is demeaning.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2014<br>Class Name: INT151<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is supposed to a really good class. But she ruined it with her unreasonably hard grading scale, quizzes twice a week, no midterm but one final which kills, and an unclear mind. I enjoy taking classes with hard grader professors, love the challenge. Yet Krista Johnsen does not deserve to be a hard grader, she shouldn't be teaching.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2005<br>Class Name: INT203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Johnson is very smart, always willing to help. I will miss her a lot; she is indeed a great teacher! The class was a lot of fun and it was very interesting. P. Johnson is a hard grader but that helps us to be more analytic when it comes to reading, research and writing. She will be missed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2005<br>Class Name: INT203<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>YO YO INT 203 all the way. Johnson was a great prof for this class, we had more fun and gained more knowledge than the section next door. :o) She is leaving for ATL, and we will miss her. To all her students in her new school, she's a very knowledgeable prof, and has improved in teaching since her first quarter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I thought she was great.  Would definately take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2005<br>Class Name: INT203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Have you noticed that everyone who has given her a bad review is talking about INT 201&#63;  Of course...201 is a notoriously difficult and hated class.  Prof. Johnson is truly a fantastic Professor.  In comparison with other INT faculty, she is clear, understanding, and incredibly smart.  She makes discussions interesting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/16/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I wish someone had told me that she requires social service in this course.We worked on-site with local AIDS coalitions(during class hours) which would have been successful except that the organization representative snubbed us.My group therefore was unable to help out the org.This was not the teachers fault,but her lack of organization didnt help</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/11/2005<br>Class Name: ISP200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a crazy suck-o. I mean how many times is it possible to utter uh ummm in a damn sentence. I don't recommend taking her. The class had the potential to be so fun and interesting. It still can be, if they replace her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2005<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>omg. take her if u want to ruin your trimester</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/03/2005<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She should not be a teacher. Very unclear; hard to follow her thoughts...because she goes on  to different topics all the time. Never set her requirements so that you could understand what she expects. Made many people quit the INT major</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2004<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Unrealistic course load.  Very unclear about the material and the assignments.  She tends to talk in circles and over her students heads.  The work is so overwhelming it will effect all your other classes.  She is an overall easy grader, make sure you go to class all the time and stay on top of it a</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2004<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cannot explain a point/thesis precisely, which is exactly what she expects her students to do. Talks in circles, even in her office hours. Very knowledgable in her area, but sadly that is a waste when she can't get a point across. Serious waste of my mornings...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/19/2004<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes stutters a lot. INT 201 was a trainwreck. She needs more classroom time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2004<br>Class Name: INT201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Johnson is a new teacher and she really knows her stuff, but she can't convey it.  She talks in circles and says uh, ummm a million times so you never know what she is talking about.  Hard grader.</div></div></div></body></html>
