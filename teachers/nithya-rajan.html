HOWEVER..i took just an intro chem class, science is NOT my major, and it was a rough class for me.She expects you to know the material, and doesn't do a good job of teaching it.homework every week,4 tests, midterm, and a final.If you are not a science major,she probably isnt the best to take</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2008<br>Class Name: CHE103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>4 quizzes, midterm, final, hw & labs due every week. Lotta work for a 100 class. STAY AWAY! that is unless ur good at chem and can teach yourself. She doesn't do example problems. We were supposed to know this stuff, I guess. Majority of the class was struggling</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/28/2008<br>Class Name: CHE101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a pretty good teacher, she is helpful and she is not as bad as they say. She throughly explains concepts like moles and treats you like an adult. She tries to make labs fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2007<br>Class Name: CHE103<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't really say this about professors unless I truly mean it but she was terrible. Don't get me wrong she's a pleasent lady but confusing and questioned herself on multiple occasions. She's unclear and doesn't really clarify herself even in her attempts to.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/28/2006<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>before taking this class i was excited but within the first week i knew i was in trouble. This lady is very nice, but she should not be teaching! She would mess up and ask the class if she was correct.  Very frustrating, she was never clear in her lectures, and always let the class out early. I would not take this class !</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2006<br>Class Name: CHEM103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is an ok teacher and I emphasize the OK! The tests are pretty self explanitory, all you need to do is do the practice quiz's online.  She just was not clear at times and hard to understand, she somtimes confused herself and did the problems wrong.  She also is very unorgainized and your papers may get lost, overall she is an OK teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/10/2006<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is the easiet class ever. If you need a science elective take her. Material is easier than high school chemistry and tests/assignments are super easy.  She is a nice lady and there is so little work required for the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2005<br>Class Name: CHE101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy but doesn't give tests back.  Unclear in explanations just rea the book and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/24/2005<br>Class Name: CHE101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman loves her chemistry!  It carries through to how she teaches as well.  I'm not a chemistry major but she got me interested in chemical equations and properties.  She also treats you like an adult, no madatory class attendance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/21/2005<br>Class Name: CHE101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i never read the book and i didn't show up to over half the classes, but i still feel like i should have gotten better than a B+.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2005<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This women is extremely nice and easy.  She does get confused sometimes but her tests are so easy it doesnt matter if she teaches at all.  You can do very little work in this class and get an A if you just show up.  Very basic chemistry ideas so I am not sure why people say she expects you to have a chem background.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2005<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just show up to class and do the homework. She gives specific objectives for the quizzes, just do those and for sure you'll get an A!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2005<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>if you hate chemistry, take this class.  I failed chemistry in high school and got an A in her class.  She can be a little confusing sometimes, but the material is easy and so are the tests and quizzes.  Easy A.  and she is really nice too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2005<br>Class Name: CHE101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not as bad as some people are saying. Take the time to learn the concepts before you start complaining. She can be unclear at times, but what she stresses over and over is what's usually on the quizzes and tests.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2005<br>Class Name: CHE101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i agree that most of us are non chem majors who're just required to take the class and she does not care and teaches it like it'll be your life. too much work for a required course and the tests were tricky. i do think she tries her best but just falls short. doesn't explain material well either.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2005<br>Class Name: CHE101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher was pretty bad. She knew this was a requirement for non-majors, but still acted as if we needed to know this material later in life. Her tests and homework questions sometimes came out of nowhere. She was just too confusing. I suppose that's why she teaches CHE101, right&#63; Man....</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2005<br>Class Name: CHE101<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE WAS DECENT. SHE TRIED TO MAKE IT AS FUN AS SHE COULD, BUT SINCE MOST OF THE STUDENTS WANTED THE GRADE AND NOT THE SUBJECT SHE WOULD NOT BE PLEASED. I DO THINK SHE DID DECENT JOB, CURVED AND OVERALL WAS CLEAR, IN ALL FAIRNESS BOOK WASALMOST AS HELPFUL</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2005<br>Class Name: CHE101<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow!! u drink when ur sad, and then u fail more miserably when u drink. taking her class is exaclty like that. she expects everyone to have previous knowledge of chem so u get lost often  and starts to doze off because its boring but then your grades are going to fall because u dozed off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: CHE101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady, bad teacher-gives bad examples and metaphors-if you're a commerce student, get a course like this out the way earlier than later, because there is better stuff to do than a class like hers-she just can't teach and explain things well enough-the test are different than the hw=your risk</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/21/2004<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have to say that not being a Chemistry major that this course was relatively difficult. She is kind of difficult to follow. She acts as if everyone knows all of the material and her mid/fianl exams which are heavily weighted plus other activities can really throw your grade off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/23/2004<br>Class Name: CHE102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what these people are talking about! This lady can't teach. She just keeps saying &quot;You guys know all this right&#63;&quot; Like we were supposed to have learned it before. The test questions were comin' outta left field. Totally not stuff she taught us. Not hard, just really confusing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/25/2004<br>Class Name: CHEM100<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>the class is extremely boring!!! not very difficult but it is boring</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2004<br>Class Name: CHEM102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this class.  I hated Chem in high school, but she actually make Chem fun.  Her assignments are very clear, tests and quizzes are easy, and her final and midterm are majority of the homework.  take this as your class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/03/2004<br>Class Name: CHE100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy enough class for the SCI requirement. She is difficult to understand being Indian... english is her second language.
