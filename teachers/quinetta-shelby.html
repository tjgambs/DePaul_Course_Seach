I would think the tests would be easy after hard reviewing over notes and doing to pretest, but when it comes time to the test, its nothing like what she went over. Her lectures are all notes she takes from the book, and she  gets very rude when asked questions. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2015<br>Class Name: 130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mistakenly ignored few bad reviews that hit the nail. She lectures, but does not teach, engage students, or upload notes to D2L. Better off self-teaching from book. Exam reviews are given two days before. No grades are uploaded to D2L; takes weeks to return work. She and TA abuse grading power on labs. Gives funny eye and look when asked questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2014<br>Class Name: CHEM128<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: D+</div><div id="right"><div>She is very rude. If you ask a question in class, she will answer it sarcastically and make you feel dumb. She may be funny at times but shes not wiling to help you get a good grade. She doesn't care for her students to learn and do successful. She just writes notes on the board, and grades. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2014<br>Class Name: CHE128<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>She's great! She explains things clearly, uses examples, and explains things from a different approach if you don't understand something the first time. She's also a really fun person. The only downside is that she gives out 4 exams before the final, so there's no real midterm. You can drop your lowest test grade. Hw is easy. I'd take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2014<br>Class Name: CHEM132<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>Shelby is selfish and ridicules students for asking questions about chemistry problems, even if the work she writes on the board is completely wrong. Her lectures are useless because she simply just copies down the textbook onto the board without explaining a single thing. Then her and French give tests with info never covered in class or the book</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/04/2014<br>Class Name: CHE130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great woman, she is probably one of the better professors in the Chem department, she wants for her students to succeed and will answer questions, just ask! She is a quality professor, she actually will teach and do her job and she enjoys her job. She goes above and beyond to explain things. Just pay attention and STUDY!!! You can succeed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/12/2013<br>Class Name: ORGOSEQUENCE<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I started taking Professor Shelby this past year for Organic Chemistry and I think she's such an amazing teacher I'm literally trying to enroll in future classes that I know she'll be teaching.

She gives daily quizzes (MWF) which are usually easy and they can really help improve your grade. Her lectures come straight from the book and she does plenty of examples in class. She tells you everything you need to know for the exams. I would definitely recommend her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2012<br>Class Name: CHE132<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor.

I have had her for 115, 171, and 173. Her notes are so detailed that I pulled off an A in 115 and 171 without buying the book. She is extremely helpful in office hours if you ever need it, which you rarely will. I definitely recommend Dr. Shelby for ANY chemistry class. You won't regret it</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2011<br>Class Name: ORGOB<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor.

She loves to crack awkward jokes. Shes a tough grader when it comes to test. and i usually feel uneasy approaching her for help.

Overall, she was very nice and pretty easy, if you're going to class and paying attention. What she teaches is directly from the book but she mentions what is and what isn't important to remember for exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/21/2009<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>overall not too bad, she had her moments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2007<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was very rude in this class and if you asked one question she made you feel very inadequate.

Willing to help, but you have to come to her.  Her tests were taken almost directly from the homework problems.  A bit intimidating at first, but if you get to know her, she's a great prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2006<br>Class Name: ORGOIII<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shelby is one of the most driven professors I've ever seen. Determined to help students learn and to get better at helping them. But it's a two way street. She's not going to lower her standards to accomodate some students. Problem: people get used to curving and think it's sin she doesn't. THat's her perogative. Organic is hard but not impossible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2006<br>Class Name: ORG173175<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>It's Org Chem it's not supposed to be easy, but she doesn't help matters.  Her quizzes are kinda easy if you do the problems she assigns and studies through the week a little.  However, the tests are ridiculous, she's way too tough of a grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: QR<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I had her for QR, she wasn't very approachable and made you feel a bit stupid if you asked for help. She was short-tempered and didn't explain things well. But she has cool dreadlocks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: ISP120<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took her for quantitative reasoning and she was bleh. She seemed really nice at first, and she's not bad. I guess its a BS class so it didn't matter but for what it's worth, she's really quirky, will kinda help you begrudgingly and deep down she's a normal person but she's probably bitter.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2006<br>Class Name: CHE173<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Shelby knows how to teach, but still needs to improve since she only started recently. However, she has a horrendous grading scale (93% to get an A), which is insane for a tough subject like Orgo. Also, everything is cummulative. If you're awesome in Chemistry or have the full-time dedication then yeah take her. But otherwise, take Dr. D.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2005<br>Class Name: CHE175321<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>O chem was horrendous as many of the reviews state.  However, her teaching greatly improved in Inorg.  She was much more relaxed and confident and informative.  The exams were graded very fairly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2005<br>Class Name: CHE175<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I HATE HER! I did fine in the class but thats all thanks to the textbook. She insults students, ignores questions and is very rude.

I just avoided her and didn't ask any questions.  her tests weren't that bad. the key to doing well in ochem is getting an easy t.a. (easy grader) for lab.  I got A's in all three chem classes because i took the same t.a.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/13/2005<br>Class Name: CHE173<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS HORRIBLE!  IF YOU MUST TAKE HER DROP IT UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE TEACHES THE CLASS!  She doesn't curve.  She does not like students asking her anything AT ALL.  She only likes the students whom seem like they get everything or &quot;the smart ones&quot;.  Everyone else she could care less about.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2005<br>Class Name: CHE175<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I studied very hard for her class and got a B+. Read the book because she teaches right out of it. She will give tricky questions sometimes on quizzes, but if you just apply what you should know, you'll be fine. She does not curve, and I was borderline with a grade and she gave me the lower one. :-(</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: CHE175<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Organic chemistry is just difficult. She does post her notes online which helps so you can just listen during class. I think she was just frustrated because we were frustrated with ourselves. She also helped me with my unknown in lab, so I don't think she is as bad as people are making her out to be. Organic chemistry is not a walk in the park.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2005<br>Class Name: OCHEM175<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She does not know how to teach or conduct a class.

Does not care about the students, always in a bad mood, unmotivating, unprepared and did not seem knowledgeable about subject. Better off to stay at home and read the book.  NO CURVE.

Maybe just needs to get into the swing of teaching. Her quizzes are tolerable if you study. If not you're screwed because she does not curve, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you study and go to her for help you will be fine in the class. I don't have much of a problem with her. She does have a sense of humor though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2005<br>Class Name: CHEM175<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AVOID HER AT ALL COST!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2005<br>Class Name: OCHEM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Stay away.
