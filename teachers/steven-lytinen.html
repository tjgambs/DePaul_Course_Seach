    The best instructor I've had so far at DePaul. I don't understand all those negative comments. He is extremely helpful with the homework assignments and not only.  It is true that sometimes he makes a mistakes but who don't.  I will take another class with him and I highly recommend Prof. Lytinen.

    His is confusing and you need to learn a lot by yourself. His exam test you with stuffs he did not assign for homework but mention in class, making the exam very tough and hard to prepare.

    His is difficult to follow, I teach my self by reading book watching tutorial video on YouTube. His exam is hard. You need to take some time to study by yourself.

    you have to teach yourself, lectures aren't helpful what so ever. Homework, labs, and tests are very confusing and poorly worded.

    He no emailed no showed 2 times before midterms (in a 10 week quarter), as well as no showed with an email 1 time. Major waste of my time to show up to the class and then have no professor. He also NEVER showed up to lab days, and took a week to email back about my question on the homework. Confused himself a lot in class, with bad code.

    Lytinen was often confused about the material.  His written material was full of typos and omissions.  It was common for his lectures to be well under way  when he discovered he did something wrong at the start and all your notes would be invalid.  I will not take another class from this individual.

    He's awesome. Probably the best instructor I've had to date. I really worked hard for a B but learned more from his class than Java I and II combined. He's really fair and great at his profession.

    The best teacher I've seen from DePaul.  Knows the material well but is very humble and personable.  Will give you as much help as you need if you put the time in.  Extremely fair grader, and makes the material very clear, something none of other professors seem capable of.  TAKE HIM.

    He is a GREAT teacher. I am a online student and he took the time to respond to my emails and actually give me help with my programs. I would take him again!

    Semi decent professor. I think he was having a bad quarter because he was out sick close to half the entire quarter. CS373 is not an easy class to understand and Lytinen put a lot of effort into helping his students understand concepts.

    Dr. Lytinen was the best professor I had at DePaul.  I graduated with a MIS in 2001 and will never forget how helpful he was while I was there.

    One of the best teachers that I ever had. Homeworks are somewhat difficult, midterm/final are a bit tricky, but there is no reason not to get an &quot;A&quot; in his class if one shows up and pays attention.

    The best, most informative, helpful professor I had in my graduate career at DePaul's CTI program.
