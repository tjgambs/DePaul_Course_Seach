If you said he was easy you are deliberately misleading others with your comments.  He was very tough - but he was a kind person, a gentleman, who was in love with his job and cared for his students. Thanks for everything Dr. B.

He was the easiest professor ever!  He's like 80-something years old now and uses a walker.  All he does is read off his notes, which are in like 16-pt font.  There are two exams, which you get 5 pts extra credit if you write in all caps, and a paper.  Honestly, like the easiest class I took at DePaul.  It's soooo boring but a guaranteed A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/02/2006<br>Class Name: CHEM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>very weird.. i sat there the whole course bored out of my mind, a lot of the times i wouldn't even go to class.. i failed the midterm, turned in my term paper late, and i'm pretty sure i failed the final.  my grade was suprisly a b-.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2005<br>Class Name: CHE109<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Labs are easy. Final is a lot easier than the midterm. The paper is easy, just pick a topic you can write a lot about. His lectures are awful and he lectures to a peice of chalk. Won't even look at you. Go to class because there is no text book to study from and all you will have is your notes. Overall, it is an easy class but very boring!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2005<br>Class Name: CHE109<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he literally lectures to the floor.  but besides that, he is a really nice guy.  labs are easy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2005<br>Class Name: CHE108<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very easy professor but is unclear when he talks and goes on and on about seemingly unrelated topics. if you pay attention in class you will be fine since all the stuff on tests is said in class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: PCHEM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really seems to like teaching and knows his stuff but can't translate it to students well at all. If you ask a question his answers are just as cryptic and hard to understand as the 'lecture'. Definite male bias; don't expect higher than a b+ if you're female-even if you do better on tests than they do. Figure that out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2005<br>Class Name: GRADCHEM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher EVER. Nice guy but terrible teaching methods. All or nothing grading is very unfair and disheartening. Don't even bother asking questions in class-he will only repeat the same confusing stuff he just told you. He should have retired years ago. If you do the homework the tests are easy, but you will walk out of his class leaning zero.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/23/2005<br>Class Name: CHE109<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hes the best!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2005<br>Class Name: CHEM109<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy:labs are not hard:paper was kind of annoying: but midterm and final come write out of the class lectures(so go to class).This class barely uses the book(a matter of fact u dont need one:he puts it on reserve for you)but make sure u memorize everything because some things may be tricky on ex</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: CHE109<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Such a nice guy.  No one goes to class but the midterm and final might have info that you wouldn't expect.  Make sure you're in class a day or two before the tests because he will go over them.  The labs are so easy.

I swear 2/3's of the class didn't show up for the class and just got the typed notes and all got B's.
