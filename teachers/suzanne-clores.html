Even when you think you're doing what she wants, it ends up being completely wrong. Clearly a rookie teacher. Never discusses assignments in class, rather sends out emails so even if you have questions it's too late by the time you get to class. Awful at explaining what she actually wants. DON'T TAKE HER! You'll regr</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/15/2006<br>Class Name: ENG104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>don't take her. says she will do something and never does.

I really liked her class and I got an A from just paying attention and coming to class. She is good at explaining if you ask questions and over all she is very nice and class involved. I loved my class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/26/2005<br>Class Name: ENG102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/05/2005<br>Class Name: WRT102<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you naturally contribute to class in a socratic seminar type manner, she will not appreciate you at all.  Even though college classes are supposed to be more accepting to open discussions without high school-type regulations, she seems to retain those trivial and unimportant regulations...not to mention her OBVIOUS liberal bias; total hippie</div></div></div></body></html>
