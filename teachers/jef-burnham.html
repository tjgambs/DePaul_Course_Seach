Professor Burnham is extremely passionate about the topic and has great lectures. There aren't many assignments, normally one every 2 weeks. Because of this though, he is kind of a harder grader. Still, he cares about the students and loves what he does. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2015<br>Class Name: KFWDN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good gen ed class with an interesting, intelligent, professor.

Really fun, nice (am I allowed to say adorkable?) guy who is down to earth. Lectures are never boring. His PowerPoints are pretty amazing. Ridiculously knowledgable about the subject too. Provides really insightful feedback on assignments. This is the only class I have never skipped. Looked forward to it.</div></div></div></body></html>
