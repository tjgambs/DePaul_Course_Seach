I rebuilt my confidence in public speaking through this class, which is awesome! Just be sure to do the assignments completely; he was a bit of a tough grader. Textbook was barely touched. Would take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2014<br>Class Name: INTC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Horning is wonderful! What an awesome guy who truly cares about his students! Public speaking is not something everyone likes, but he makes it fun, interesting, and way less nerve racking. He's an expert in his field and if you get the chance, take his class!! He's pretty funny too :) </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2014<br>Class Name: INTC220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful prof, friendly, cares to talk to you before class about anything or helps you narrow down your speech. A bit of a tough grader though. Don't get the book, didn't even use it</div></div></div></body></html>
