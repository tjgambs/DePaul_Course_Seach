    I really learned a lot about Jewish culture. English is my second language and I am not good at writing a paper, but if you carefully take notes and pay attention to what he says, you'll get an A!! He also helps students very well outside of class! He gives us discount for a Jewish play sometimes :)

    Although he may be adorable and have interesting stories his Jews in Film course was hard. You are given extensive and lengthy plays and are expected to write analysis' of the themes when they are hardly reviewed in class. He also just touches on the themes and you are expected to figure out the rest.
