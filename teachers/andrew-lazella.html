One of the best I've EVER had. Go to class having read the material, read in class when he asks for volunteers, and when he asks if there are any questions don't be afraid to ask. You evoke the class discussions, he already knows this material. Definitely hope that I can take more classes with him!  He is an asset to DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2009<br>Class Name: PHL294<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>attend every class, listen to the guy, ask questions, read out loud a lil bit and you're set!  also hes pretty funny :)  no inclass exams</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/14/2009<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am not a fan of philosophy, so I didn't really enjoy the class. I did learn a LOT though. He really cares about his subject and he knows the answer to every question you can think to ask him. He's very intelligent, but I wished there were better class discussions. The class was more of him lecturing than anything else. Two papers-not hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Andrew was a very entertaing prof.I wasnt interested in PHL at all but he made the 3hr class every week really fly by. Energetic teacher, you can tell he loves what he is teaching.Easy to communicate with, 2papers were not hard, easy 5question quizzes every week on the reading.He gave on avg. 30pgs of reading per week. I'd definitely take him again</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2008<br>Class Name: PHL296<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is very knowledgable about the subject. He knows alot and encourages class participation but, he can kind of spaz out at points which make it hard to follow his lectures, overall he was a good professor though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2008<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Kinda boring but seriously one of the best professors for sure.  Goes through the material nice and slow so everyone gets it. Very helpful. Work hard and you'll get a good grade. TAKE IF YOU CAN!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/13/2007<br>Class Name: PHILO100<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know how and why these people give him a High rating. Andrew, is a big hype on philosophy and can be confusing at times. His lectures are boring and his grading is rediculous. Make sure that you are serious about philosphy if you want to take his class. Im very smart and taking his class gave me my first C+ ever.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/10/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he repeats himself alot, which can get a little confusing. personally i really don't like philosophy so i didnt really enjoy the class. however, a lot of the people in my class seemed to really like him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2007<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>HE IS AN AWESOME TEACHER.

EXTREMELY helpful in and out of class--very clear on his expectations and very knowledgable on the subject of Philosophy.

He makes sure that everybody knows and understands the material. He gives quizes every week, but just read the material and you will be fine. Papers take work, but he will help you if you need it. Overall, I would take him for another class. Take him for you PHL requirements. You wont regret it!:)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/21/2006<br>Class Name: PHL100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's one of the few good- looking teachers.  nice guy really tried to get you interested. pretty easy grader.  just participate a lot and he'll love you.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2006<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT.
