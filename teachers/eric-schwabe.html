We had lecture on Tuesdays and lab on Thursdays. This type of instruction was very beneficial to me and my learning style. Not a ton of homework, but the homework he does give will help you learn to write code. There is a midterm and final plus a final project. Overall good class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2013<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't buy the textbook. I got an A without doing any of the assigned tb readings. Profs material is more than enough to understand everything. Exams and assignments make you think about the concepts. Everything on the exams is covered in class at least once if not multiple times.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2013<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This course was not supposed to be so hard but it was a killer. I didn't understand anything from the lectures or homework. The concepts were too high level and the exams were mind games and puzzles. This is a terrible course. A friend took this course with another professor. I compare exams. Completely different and much easier.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2013<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly clear and willing to re-explain anything. Very approachable and easy-going. Explains everything and makes it clear what he expects of your assignments, labs, and exams. If you think the class is boring, then it is the class subject itself, not him. Take him if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/30/2013<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good professor. Class comprises of assignments and labs. I had a very high interest in HTML and javascript programming so this class was really fun. One day he teaches from powerpoint, and the other day is lab day where you work on what was presented. I would highly recommend him. Final and midterm very reasonable with no surprises.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/07/2012<br>Class Name: CSC202<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a great teacher, and the tests are not that hard.

He takes ever thing that is hard and makes it super easy. His homework and exams aren't that hard, you just need to understand the question.

Power point lectures and give print of his examples but his examples do not correlate with his homework assignments and labs.  Also the book was not so useful and he gives out extra credit.  He drops the lost homework assignment and yes the test are somewhat difficult.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/08/2009<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>at my first year i picked him randomly and i was afraid being tought html and java with a hard prof would be a nightmare.

Seriously the best prof I've had. Very clear and concise, extremely helpful in and out of class. Very nice guy. Interesting lectures. Exams are challenging, but so is Java. Wish he taught CSC212 for the following quarter. I highly recommend taking him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/24/2009<br>Class Name: CSC451<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great at explaining.

Anyone that says otherwise just wants an easy A.  Unfortunately there are slackers in the class that simply want an easy ?A?!!!!  His grading is fair if you got a bad grade it?s because your programming sucks!!! I can't believe anyone would have anything bad to say about this prof, he is extremely smart, very well organized!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/18/2008<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is such a jerk when it comes to grading exams.  He will nail you for every minute detail and your grade will suffer greatly.  Grading on the assignments did not seem to be as harsh, but completely unfair come exam time.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/19/2008<br>Class Name: IT236<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>hard grader teach so fast</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/01/2007<br>Class Name: CSC802<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Method of teaching isn't bad, but seems like he favors certain students. Gets agitated easily when asked &quot;obvious&quot; questions about formatting, attendance, grading, things like that. Late registerers don't get extra time for that week's assignment. He gets distracted easily if you're on your laptop, and makes you feel stupid when asking questions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/23/2006<br>Class Name: CSC309<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very good teacher.

Knows what he's talking about. He's always helpful, just get to him in an appropriate amount of time. A little bit of effort will get you a long way. Has a quirky sense of humor that most just don't get. I'd take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/12/2005<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not a CTI major and yet this class wasn't TOO bad. However, you do need to study alot, prob. regardless of who your professor is. Hes actually one of the more clearer CS professors. He is very helpful outside class. Hes alot better than majority of others. Homework and test are similar to class examples which he gives alot of. You'll learn alot</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2005<br>Class Name: INTROTONETWEB<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible teacher. Would never take him or recommend his class. If I needed this class to graduate, I'd drop out!!!! YES! That bad!  Goes around a question because most of the time he doesn't even understand what he's &quot;trying&quot; to teach. Goes way too fast as if we are all experts in HTML etc....and I took a beg. class w/ no pre-req.!!!! NEVER AGAIN!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: CSC211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Oh he isnt that bad. He can be a bit boring but it's not like comptuer programing is the most exciting topic in the world to teach anyway. Hes alot easier to follow then other teachers i have had for previous programing classes. I recommend him if you need to take any java programing classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2005<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Almost dropped this class due to bad ratings here. So glad that I didn't. I loved this class! I learned a lot and found his lectures to be interesting. As long as you go to class and take notes the assignments aren't too hard. He's always willing to help when you're confused. Midterm is hard though so make sure you study a lot. An A is possible.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2005<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor; he knows his stuff but I wish I took him for CSC 211! :-)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2005<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OMG this man is boring as hell!!!! i sat in class and watched Meet The Parents, Old School, and a lot of other movies and still passed his class!
