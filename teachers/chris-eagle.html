What I liked most is he really takes time to read your essays and give you actually helpful comments on both form and content.  He sends paper comments by email and for each paper the comments were a page long.   I turned my final in early and got my grade.  A-minus.  Key with him is participation!   Talk in class & you'll do fine.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2015<br>Class Name: 275<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B-</div><div id="right"><div>This class is on films and novels (black & white crimedetective stories), so I kind of expected it to be easier than it was.  The movies are cool, but Prof Eagle's a definitely tough grader.   If you don't analyze the books very carefully, expect a bad grade, as I learned with my first 2 papers.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/22/2015<br>Class Name: 389<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Class was fun, we lauged alot; and made me think different about language.  Harder grader, took time to really help me with my writing at office hours tho. Not too much readings, but u really need to read the books and look prepaired.  </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2015<br>Class Name: 389<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Eagle has the feel of a grad student minus snobbery. He does not give helpful feedback or make expectations clear which is why I had trouble with this class. My only A- since I have been at DePaul, and I do not think I deserved it. Books are good, but I would have read on my own to avoid him. If you have no expectations how can you succeed?</div></div></div></body></html>
