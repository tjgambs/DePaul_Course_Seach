So, if you're not paying attention in lecture, make sure you start to when she moves on to demonstrating on the computer. She always holds reviews before tests- these are super helpful. Very nice lady. She definitely knows what she is talking about too. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Davidson was great! She is very helpful and offers so much extra credit it would be impossible to fail her course. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a great professor who was always willing to help students during class and office hours. Her lectures are a little long, but she makes it fun. Would definitely recommend taking her class and any others that she teaches!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/08/2014<br>Class Name: 121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Mary is really helpful one on one. However, her lectures are really boring and tend to drag. They can also be confusing, especially with the use of SPSS instead of Excel. Be prepared to work for this grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2014<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>The Professor is extremely nice but man did this class drag. Most people were online shopping or on Facebook because she pretty much just goes over all of the lecture slides that are provided online. Nothing we learned in class is beneficial to our lives. This class was a waste of time and it sucks it's mandatory if you can't test out of it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Gives a lot of extra credit that helps understand the material better and more in depth. Three exams, and in my opinion the first one was the most difficult. Attend class, it's easy attendance points! If you don't go (like me) it could bring your grade a letter down. Wishing I had gone more to get an A, lesson learned! Overall good class/professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/21/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She makes a boring required class interesting. The teacher is very helpful and really wants to understand the material, which can be challenging if you are not tech savvy. There are 3 tests that are easy. There is a lot of extra credit too. Hands down, she is one of my favorite teachers at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Love Love Love Dr. Davidson! The class content is not the most exciting but she is super helpful and it should not be difficult to get an A if you utilize her help. Also, offers a ton of extra credit! Very sweet teacher</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2013<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice person. Really sweet, reminds me of my 5th grade teacher. Willing to help anyone. Powerpoints are too detailed but its mandatory to go to class. Offers extra credit. Even brings sweets every exam days. Recommend this professor if you are planning to take LSP 121.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/11/2012<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly nice teacher!  If you don't understand something she will always make herself available to answer questions and gave us tons of time to ask questions.  She also offers a lot of extra credit.  I would most definitely recommend this professor.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/02/2012<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not exactly someone who keeps your interest, but she tries very hard. She's very helpful and understanding and most importantly, she wants you to succeed. It's a boring class, but you have to stomach through it anyway, so she's a good option.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2012<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was extremely easy. The homework was very easy, and she offered tons of extra credit. She also brought the class candy on exam days, so that was nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2012<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is absolutely one of the BEST teachers/professors I've ever had! I have struggled with math all my life, and she actually made math bearable and even fun sometimes. She is very patient and fair--doesn't ask too much of you. FANTASTIC, UNDERSTANDING AND WONDERFUL PROFESSOR. TAKE HER CLASS!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/26/2012<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm not a math person so this class was probably more difficult for me than it will be for others. Davidson is very nice and helpful both in and out of class. Tutoring hours were also extremely helpful. Weekly individual assignments and a small "team" assignment. No midterm or final but 3 non-comprehensive exams over the 3 subjects covered.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2012<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very helpful professor. she has reviews the class before the exam to let you know exactly what will be on it. The material is challenging and lectures are meh, but if you at least, there is no reason you should not get an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2011<br>Class Name: IM210<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took the online version of this class. Assignments were not overwhelming at all. Lectures were easy to follow, but the course online was a bit cluttered and confusing. Liked the books she assigned... and I usually hate reading. Take her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2011<br>Class Name: IM210<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Disorganized, not clear, hard to know what will be on exams because there are 200 Powerpoint slides to study from. Doesn't seem interested when giving lecture.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2011<br>Class Name: IM210<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lectures are awful, rambling, and disorganized. The book has nothing to do with the slides which have nothing to do with the lecture. Grades on assignments not clearly explained. Exams are impossible to study for. She did give us the option to resubmit things for full credit however.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/23/2011<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was a little bit difficult for me, but she was so helpful! She spends a day teaching the subject, then gives you a day to work with a group to get the homework done. Pay attention to her lectures and you'll be ok! I recommend going to office hours in the computer lab, that helped me too :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2010<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. D is great very very nice and helpful! also she gives like over a 100 points of EC!!! no final or midterm just 3 nonculmative tests!! Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2009<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. D is one saucy lady, let me tell you. It is often hard to concentrate on the topic at hand with all that sauce everywhere.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2009<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>really boring/easy class. just pay attention occasionally and you can figure the rest out for yourself</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2009<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good Professor.  Is really helpful out of class if you are having trouble with the material.  Take her class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2009<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. D was a good teacher. She's a good teacher and makes the material easy to understand. Attendance isn't technically mandatory, but you get points for being there. You get a lot of class time to work on assignments, and if you're confused she helps you until you understand.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/09/2008<br>Class Name: CSC200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>An easy science class to take. You will learn without much effort! She gives 75 extra crd points for heaven's sakes! Hmwk is useful in realworld. I got over 100% in this class and only opened the book the night before each test. Only do the chp exams and u will pass with flying colors. GREAT TEACHER OVER ALL! I would take her again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: CSC200<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't have the same fun experience with her that everyone else is advertising. She never responded to my emails & was a very unfair grader considering the sheer crap she taught every day. I don't know why attendance was mandatory because she only read from her PowerPoints & posted them online later. The textbook was a waste. Take someone else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/06/2008<br>Class Name: CSC200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is by far the best that DePaul has to offer. There are class assignments due every week but they are very straight forward and she goes over the assignments with you step by step.  You have to be completely stupid to not get an A or B.  She is extremely patient and friendly with everyone! Also, she gives 75 bonus points!!! Loved her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2008<br>Class Name: CSC200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was extremely informative and freindly.  If you don't receive an &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; in this class you are really lazy and college isn't for you.  Read the required chapters and go to class and you will more likely than not receive an &quot;A&quot; I really learned a lot and will carry with me what I've learned!!!! TAKE CSC 200!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/24/2008<br>Class Name: CSC200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>AWESOME! Her class is very straightforward and useful. Most of the assignments were done in class, so no homework. Take notes, read the chapter tests and you will have an A. - she also gives a tone of extra credit (75pts)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2008<br>Class Name: ISP121<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very patient and nice teacher who wants her students to do well. I hated having to take this class, but I can't blame her for it. You get stuck working with other students, and if they suck then you suffer- that was the worst!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2007<br>Class Name: CMNJOUR<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Why does she teach journalism&#63;  I still have no idea- wasn't her college major according to her,she never wrote, doesn't seem to have much off the top info.  Class is very very easy, but if you want to learn anything what-so-ever, you should probably take someone else.  Which is a shame- because she teaches some good classes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/31/2007<br>Class Name: CSC200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was super easy. The lectures were completely boring and I would rather watch paint dry, but she really tries and she makes the class as engaging as she can I think. This is the best class to take to get rid of a science class. Take it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2007<br>Class Name: CMN377<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>follow the directions carefully on her assignments, even when it seems too easy, and you will get an A in her class. She is always willing to help out and we always got out an hour early!

I missed about a month of class and still got an A.  Wow, Davidson is kinda nice most of the time but lectures are unbearable!!  Assignments and notes are easy and posted on Course On-Line.  Scientific Inquiry: Quantitave requirement filled with no struggle at all! P.S. Dont buy the book! Didnt open it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2006<br>Class Name: CSC223<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is incredibly boring and should be a distance learning course because lecture is not necessary. Assignments are interesting and easy. Nice lady. Easy grader if you follow her guidelines. Midterm and final are 7 and 12 pg papers, but research is easy and you can pick your topic. Make it interesting for your own sake. Take her if you need an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2006<br>Class Name: CSC223<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy and understanding at some points but an illogical grader.  i got a 50 on my FINAL because she didnt like the format of my 12 page paper</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is very nice and laid back.

You will strugle if you dont know excel, access,ect.  She loads you up with assignments.  I took her for computer survey, and we have to write a 15page paper final.  She is always willing to help, but she is strict with grades.  Dont waste your money with the text book you never need it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: HCI210<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she has an easy going personality, but dont let it fool you, she is picky when it comes to grades. she cares about her students. you just have to work hard to get a good grade, but its easy material. take her :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2006<br>Class Name: CSC200<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Doesn't really teach just assigns work then sends you to the computer lab...it could have easily been an online course.</div></div></div></body></html>
