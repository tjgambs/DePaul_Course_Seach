The material is very easy though, so if you're good at teaching yourself math, it won't be too hard. Nice guy, bad teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Modica is an okay professor. If you have never taken a calculus class, I suggest not to take him because he can be a little unclear at times. But, if you try, get help when you need it, and turn in the assignments, his class will be an easy A. He gives 4 quizzes (each one about 10 ?s) and gives an almost identical practice quiz a week in advance.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2015<br>Class Name: 135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Avoid this guy at all costs. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2015<br>Class Name: MAT136<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: B+</div><div id="right"><div>Good thing about the class: give extra credits if you answer his questions Bad thing about the class: he's definitely not an easy grader and if you have never taken Calculus in high school, I would not suggest you to take him...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2015<br>Class Name: 135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Terrible. The worst professor i have ever taken. The quizzes are not like the tests at all. He gives you a take home packet along with a big review packet for each quiz and it's so useless. His grading scale is ridiculous, and it makes me feel like he knows he's a terrible teacher. Avoid this guy at all cost. Go to someone that will be worth your $</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/28/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really liked Professor Modica. Many of my classmates disliked him, because he's very straightforward. It might come off that he over simplifies his lessons, but in my opinion I like that. There's no midterm, just four quizzes, and he gives a practice quiz before each one that is really similar to the actual quiz. I would definitely recommend. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Modica is a very skilled professor. He has 50+ years experience teaching in this field and because of his significant experience, he can be condescending and disrespectful towards students who ask him simplebasic questions. A solid grasp of pre-calculus is required to be successful. This class is about 13 of AP Calculus AB.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/13/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gives credit for going to class. His practice quizzes will save your grade. The tutors will help. He isn't the greatest teacher but he does teach you something. Be ready to work. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a very hard professor. Difficult to understand and teaches proofs before actually teaching you how to do the problem. He's funny but that does not carry you far when it comes to grades. If you do decide to have him as a professor, be prepared to go to tutoring! And you will not need a textbook, he does not use it or MathLabs so save the cash.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2015<br>Class Name: MATH135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a horrible professor and will make you feel stupid if you don't know the material. Stay away from him at all costs. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2015<br>Class Name: 135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: C-</div><div id="right"><div>He is really rude to students! Get ready to feel like you're really dumb because that's all that he does! You can tell he's smart but he doesn't do a good job at translating it to the students. I would avoid him! </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/14/2015<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's smart, but rude to students. He assumes you should know everything he is teaching and strongly recommends you to go to tutors. Be prepared to study on your own.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/05/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You could tell he is really smart but his teaching is unclear and ineffective. Four quizzes and four projects. No midterm. The final was 10 questions. He is rude to students when you ask him a question, even when you approach him after class and during office hours. And he doesn't use the textbook at all so don't waste the $200.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2014<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very intelligent guy, gives good non-math advice esp. for freshmen. He's very intelligent. 5 projects 5 quizzes and final. All quizzes are pretty much the same as the practice ones he hands out. Take him, come to his class, and study the practice quizzes and you will get an A. Perfect attendance  +3%</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/28/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This teacher is incredibly rude. Asking him to explain a step leads to him telling you that you're stupid in front of the entire class and that he's smarter than you. Not Don't buy the book you wont use it. He wont answer your questions, so the tutors will basically be teaching you. I don't understand how this guy is a teacher at Depaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2014<br>Class Name: MAT130<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor! He  explains why he has taken the steps when solving a problem and points out where students make mistakes. Exams are very easy because he hands out a practice exam a week before. He is very clear and knows his stuff, I mean come on, he graduated from University of Chicago. I recommend him. Do not buy a book! You'll never use it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2014<br>Class Name: MAT135<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: Not sure yet</div><div id="right"><div>You never use the book  so dont buy it. No syllabus and you never know what chapter you are on. Rude, and never answers your questions. He tells you to go to the tutors and they have a hard time understanding his questions since he makes up his own. You have 5 quizzes and he gives you a review that is like the quiz. 5 projects. AVOID THIS TEACHER!!</div></div></div></body></html>
