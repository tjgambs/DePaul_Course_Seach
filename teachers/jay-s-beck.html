Do the reading and participate a little and you'll do fine. His papers are short and even the final research paper was rather easy. He may seem vague but all you have to do is ask and he'll practically write a book answering you in detail;even collaborates with you. Great guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He always responds to your comments and is very engaging. He allows rewrites on papers which is great. Be prepared for pop quizzes though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/12/2009<br>Class Name: MCS273<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice guy. He knows what he's talking about. Somewhat of a tough grader, but if you show up for class and take notes, you will be fine. 3 papers, midterm, and final. This class is somewhat boring, but that's not his fault. I think DePaul made a mistake making this a 273 class. I'd take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/05/2009<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a cool guy. Had him for my Punk in the U.K. focal point class. For every comment some one gives, he actually comments on it rather than just give a &quot;Yeah&quot; response. When he assignes papers, he does allow for rewrites and gives alot of feedback on them as well.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/19/2008<br>Class Name: CMN348<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice guy...knows his stuff. SOmetimes class could get a little boring with lectures, but he always made sure to show interesting movie clips and whatnot in our class. He was also a pretty funny guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best professors I've had thus far.  Really knows what he's talking about and makes it really interesting for the class. Very helpful, once wrote a whole page of feedback on how to correct a paper I got just a B on.  Talks to the class instead of at them.  All around cool guy.  Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2007<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved this guy and the class.  He is easy-going, fun and really interesting.  I want to switch majors just so I can have him again.  The class is based on small readings which he gives you; 3 papers and a final paper what determine the grade.  If you listen closely to the lectures (which are interesting!) he tells you what he wants. Fun class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/10/2006<br>Class Name: ACHS1984<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/03/2006<br>Class Name: CMN348<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really love this guy!  He's so straight forward. No confusion whatsoever with this professor.  He gives the material to you flat out, and it's pretty much understandable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/12/2006<br>Class Name: CMN347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Jay Beck rocks. This is the third class i have taken with him.He has great passion when dealing with film and music, two of my favorite things as well. All in all take a class you wont regret it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: CMN347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Perhaps my favorite professor at DePaul.  He's very smart, and knows what he's talking about.  Refreshingly challenging.  He definatly was able to inspire me to learn more about cinema.  I took a second class from this guy because I learned so much the first time!  Plus he's really nice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/19/2005<br>Class Name: CMN206FILM<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a really nice laid back guy, except he gives you way to much information to handle in his classes.  But ive taken him before and ended up getting a B in INTO to R,T,F.  THe notes are a lot and thus you have a lot to study for.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/28/2005<br>Class Name: DC206101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love this class. Dr. Beck is very helpful. He gets really into it, and he has incredible knowledge of Flim History. He likes to make sure students are understanding the material.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2005<br>Class Name: FILM<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Study guides are SO LONG - very annoying because tests are very short and it's difficult to pinpoint what he'll ask.  Boring lectures, minimal discussion, but he's otherwise a nice guy.  Papers are easy. You're not required to go to the lab but make sure to watch the weekly movies because they will be on the exams.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/04/2005<br>Class Name: CMN271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is so nice! Class is pretty boring but you can get through it! Its worth it! Everyone did bad on the midterm so he made the final take home b/c he blamed himself! Quite a bit of reading but I really never read! He is great! Just take him!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2005<br>Class Name: CMN206<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's not a bad teacher.  Everyday is the same crap though and some of the movies we had to watch were horrible.  His midterm and test study guides are ridiculously long!!  I'm serious, for our final we had 117 questions on the study guide and only 12 questions on the actual test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty boring lectures, extremely long reading assignments, but great screenings in class.  You get to watch Buffy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: CMN271<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor, really knows a lot about the subject and balanced class time wisely.  He showed a lot of great films and clips. As long as you study for the mid-term and final they are a breeze.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/10/2005<br>Class Name: CMN<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Horrible....So boring and basically just explains the book by spitting off facts and pretending he knows the stuff. Do not take this class because you will want to die</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/08/2005<br>Class Name: CMN206<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/04/2004<br>Class Name: CMN271<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Are you kidding me&#63;  The lectures were too long, and the tests were very hard. He's nice but boring. I do not recommend this teacher at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2004<br>Class Name: CMN347<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he's a very nice guy, kind of funny - but his lectures do tend to be a little boring. some of the films he picks are SLOW - but others are amazing. i'd recommend him, because he's very knowledgeable and teaches interesting classes, generally speaking.</div></div></div></body></html>
