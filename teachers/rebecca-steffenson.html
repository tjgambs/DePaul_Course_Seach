    Be prepared to work hard and learn a TON! You are required to think, so if this is something you do not want to do, do not take her class. Otherwise, you will do great.

    Amazing professor. Changed the way that I see globalization and social interactions. She studied abroad and reaally knows what she's talking about. Likes it when political science/international studies students take her classes because it'll help them. Changed my life and study habits. Wonderful and super caring. constant participation is a must!!!

    I took her for Explore Chicago, and she was fantastic. She covered many key points and ties everything together in the end giving it meaning. Although the class seems a little pointless, she does give it her best. Her class can be hard, but its worth it.

    She's a horrible teacher! Very vague in what she wants students to learn and thinks she knows everything. There's a lot of learning on your own, since her lectures are very repetitive.

    Probably the best professor I've ever taken. Essays are open but she goes through them step by step in class. If you don't show up or take notes you're screwed. Tough grader on papers but she is also fun: gives credit for using facebook and making videos! You'll have to work hard but if you do you will learn more in 10 weeks than you can imagine.

    Great professor, knows how to actually teach the information. Clearly outlines the entire class on the first day and is always available and willing to help out on any problems whatsoever. Not any easy class but well worth it!

    Good professor and has interesting lectures... But, the essays are so vague its ridiculous and so open ended that its very hard to narrow down.. But if you work hard the class is very beneficial..
