    Great teacher, makes working out a lot of fun, understands everyone's limit and doesn't push too hard, but is very encouraging. If you miss more than 2 classes, you can make them up whenever. The syllabus is really good, i lost 7 pounds during her class; you become aware of how to care for your body. She taught the class while 5 months pregnant!

    She is an awesome teacher. She gives alot of homework which is easy but takes time and effort. This class really prepares you well if you're going to teach health. She is also funny, compassionate, energetic, and so friendly! She's like your best friend! I will miss the fun times I had in this class. Truly a great teacher. sob sob sob.
