I would only take her if you have an interest in pursuing photography as a career. Assignments are much too hard and her grading is horribly inconsistent. Take anyone else for DC125.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/18/2013<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is so boring. All she does is talk about herself and her own views. She treats you like a child, but then expects far too much from you. For an "art" class, the midterm was ridiculous. She never explained the basic elements of art, but then tested you on them. It's a very textbook oriented class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2011<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a very nice professor. I didn't have any background knowledge coming into this class so it was a bit hard at times. The midterm is kinda hard but she's a nice grader. You have a couple photography projects and watch really interesting movies during class. I got an A in this class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2011<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was pretty fun, not what I expected but glad I took it. She's slow to grade assignments. Mid is short answer and kinda hard but she doesn't grade too hard on that. Overall, she's super nice and class is fun</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/20/2011<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Amazing teacher made me like photography more</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/02/2011<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you do the work you will get an A</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2011<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Nice lady but a little slow to get assignments back. Also, never answers email.

There is a photo assignment every week along with some reading. The class is videotaped, so when you miss, can just watch it on your own time.  Did freak out one time when a student walked out of class five minutes early and chased them down the hall.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/22/2009<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good class, challenging enough to expand your view but not so hard that anyone would likely fail.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2009<br>Class Name: DC225<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Angela is a really cool teacher.  She sometimes won't be able to answer all your questions and tends to gloss over some of the mechanics of photography, but she clearly has a passion for it. Someone that would be fun to have a couple drinks with, and not just because she's really easy on the eyes. ;)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2009<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome professor. she is really sweet. digital photo at night is great :D i recommend the night class it goes by fast.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice professor learned a lot of new things. willing to answer any questions about careers in photo. hard to get help in class if u have a hard time undersanding photoshop 40 people in class. had to raise hand for 20 minutes! also it is hard to do the photoshop project cause only 2 labs in the loop have it and the classrooms are rarely open</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHe is very nice and fun teacher. Definitely very helpfully and even though photography is a subject I know well i was able to take something new with me. Plus I think she is cute and has killer eyes.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/09/2009<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>class was fun, but sometimes pointless. would see a lot of slideshows and movies that makes fall asleep and how to use photoshop. about 5 photo projects (really easy!), mini paper, test on lecture and book (that i didn't buy!) and a final of whatever you want. I got an easy B in the class. highly rec if you want to get an AL out of the way.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/07/2008<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>For the most part a good professor. Takes a while to get things back. Blames it on teaching 70+ students but have had professors teaching 120+ students and could get work back within a week. It's hard to adjust based on feedback when you haven't yet gotten feedback on your past assignment from two weeks earlier. But other than that good prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2008<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is pretty nice and easy to get in touch with outside of class.  It was a bit more work than I was expecting, but the class made me a better photographer.</div></div></div></body></html>
