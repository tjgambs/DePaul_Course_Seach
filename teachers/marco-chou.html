    Marco is a fantastic professor and I really enjoy his classes!!! He is very knowledgeable about the subject which makes it easier to understand the material. No one in the class had anything bad to say about him. Try to take his class if you really want to get a comprehensive foundation in database administration and management!!!!

    His CSC 454 was really great, but CSC 453 was too easy. By the way, he is the nicest professor at Depaul

    Marco is very nice and seems to enjoy teaching. He explains things pretty well.  The homework is time-consuming and can be a little tricky sometimes, but otherwise the class isn't too hard.

    Homework is pretty easy, but a little time consuming.  His notes are very detailed.  He is easy to understand and a very nice guy.
