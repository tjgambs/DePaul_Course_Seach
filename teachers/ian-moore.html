    Professor Moore is very knowledgable on the subject, but often confusing in the way that he explains material. He is easy going, though his calm nature made the class boring and monotonous, with his voice droning on. I wish he had shown more enthusiasm but it was an ok class. Material was repetitious and Im not sure how much I actually learned.
