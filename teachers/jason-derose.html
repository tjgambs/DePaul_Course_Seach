    He expects students to do all the reading. He expects students to attend, take notes during, and participate in class. He expects students to demonstrate understanding of the material on exams and in papers. None of this is unreasonable. He's just tough.

    Let me start by saying I learned nothing from this professor.  I wondered why I even bother showing up oh yeah reading quizes everyday.  His quizzes are unrealistic he wants you to fill in the blank from exact quotes, cmon 100 pages of reading ask me about the context not direct quotes.  Does he have a teaching degree&#63;  I am beginning to wonder.

    He is realy, really hard. He expects us to read 100 pages a week of really hard stuff like Augustine and Calvin and then he gives us quizes. He think a C is a good grade on a paper. He alwasy wants us to discuss but won't tell us what he wants us to say in the papers.

    He's very demanding. A hard grader. But the material is interesting and he's a good lecturer. He seems to think he's funny. But he's not.
