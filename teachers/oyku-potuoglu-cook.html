    Very very passionate about her class/her field of study. Unfortunately in her middle eastern studies class I felt very behind (like there was a pre-requisite) by the first session and it just went downhill afterward. There's a crazy amount of reading assigned to each class session, which is only doable if you have a genuine interest in the subject.

    AWESOME TEACHER! Invested, passionate, and caring. She likes to challenge us to think differently about culture. I loved the fieldtrips in Humboldt Park. Wouldn't trade this class for any other.

    She was overall very good, if you pay attention, take good notes and study you should be fine, for this class there was only a couple of quizzes, a few papers and no real test/final, but there was a project at the end pf the quarter that required a presentation, but she made it very fun, enjoyable and interesting, opened my eyes about how interesti
