    i really looked forward to this class, but i ended up being disappointed. There wasn't much application to the school setting - the emphasis is more on studio work. i felt like i didn't learn much to bring to my classroom. Also, the prof doesn't have experience teaching an ed class... something that i think is a big disadvantage
