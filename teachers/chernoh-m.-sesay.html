His recent class blew my mind on religion, race, and slavery within the US. I absolutely wish I was in his department or even minoring to participate in his classes, I'm really sad this is the only class I can take with him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/27/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very knowledgeable. Expectations are given at the beginning and remain the same all through the course. The class itself is not difficult, however if religion or theology is not in your interests then the lectures will drag. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2015<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Sesay is great! As long as you show up to class, make sure you read, and take easy notes, you won't do bad. There are 3 papers and alot of easy but annoying reflectionreview papers. He is extremely knowledgeable in religion and ties it into modern eras, so it is very interesting</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2015<br>Class Name: REL218<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>TAKE HIM! This class was incredibly eye opening! Professor Sesay taught very well, and his class lectures were very engaging, and he always gave opportunities for class discussion. There is a lot of reading in the class, but they are all interesting reads. One of my favorite professors at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/21/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of my BEST professors at DePaul University, so far. Very clear  articulate style of teaching material. Very intelligent  knowledgeable about subject matter. Always available for feedback with flexible scheduling. Overall, Professor Sesay is Awesome.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/08/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Sesay had good and bad aspects. To start with the bad, he assigned pointless readings (like 50 pages a night) that didn't make sense and he always got confused with himself. He would forget what he assigned and explain it wrong. However, he is super easy and such a nice guy, he made the dullest topic ever somewhat interesting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Very interesting and smart professor. He does assign a lot of readings and essays but; nonetheless, I do not regret taking him for Focal Point. I would suggest him for your Focal Point class if you are actually interested on the topic otherwise it will be a horrible class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2014<br>Class Name: LSP200<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you really want to know a lot about religion, this is your guy. He is extremely knowledgeable about what he teaches. Class can be boring at times because it is mainly a lecture, but as long as you show up to class and can write good papers you will do good in his class</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/19/2014<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Assigns A LOT of pointless readings. Hard grader - must write essays using his lectures or else it'll be heavily marked down. Wastes a good 20 minutes of each class taking attendance and other unrelated things.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2014<br>Class Name: REL219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. Very organized. 3-4 Papers. Class attendance points. Offers extra credit. Lot's of readings about different religions and how religion itself played a huge role in slavery. Take notes during his lectures, he basically tells you everything you need to write for your papers. Answers any questions you may have during class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/17/2013<br>Class Name: REL115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>Cessay is a good professor. I took him my freshman year and I'm now a 4th year. I remember him giving a lot of reading and we had like 3-4 papers but the class was interesting so the papers were a breeze. In class he used a lot of big words and he would phrase the questions in a way that no one understood what he was asking but overall good prof.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/03/2013<br>Class Name: REL219<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Sesay has a system for participation that I really liked that accounts for attendance and hw, not just talking in class. This was nice for me because I'm not a big talker. There was a lot of small hw assignments that were pretty easy. A few papers, you can pick your topic out from his choices.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/25/2013<br>Class Name: REL218<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty interesting class. Daily homework, 4 papers 3-5 pages. OK grader. Lots of reading. He sometimes appears unorganized and changes due dates but it all works out in the end. Mandatory attendance, if you miss class you will lose points for participation. When he asks the whole class a question, answer it or you'll be put in small groups.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/11/2012<br>Class Name: REL219<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was alright. The course subject was awesome. He lost his train of thought or the photo he wanted to show often. Came off as disorganized and didn't teach much during class. By doing the readings and the papers I learned a lot on my own. Class time felt wasted and slow. He's a really nice guy though and very helpful outside of class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/25/2012<br>Class Name: REL111<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Engages class in lectures. He seems unorganized. It took him 3 weeks to finally get a correct syllabus online. no tests, midterms, or final, only 3 papers. His teaching style is all over the place, so it is easier to take notes on a computer instead of writing all of his tangents.He assigns a lot of reading in the textbook but, assignments are easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: REL219<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I dread taking religion courses, but I needed it so I took it. Professor Sesay is a really good teacher. He's extremely knowledgeable and very helpful. The amount of reading required was on the heavy side, but the lectures were engaging and interesting. There were no exams, but 3 essays. I'd take him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/18/2011<br>Class Name: REL217<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Had him for Af-Am religion it was overall interesting but did have a few dry spots, he's kind of a tough grader even if you do go in and talk to him. He's pretty fine too.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/02/2011<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a super nice guy and I know that the first year program makes him structure the class a certain way so any lsp 112 class is going to be similar. I was lost a lot during class but he always goes out of his way to be as clear as possible. In short, hated the class, not him though.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2011<br>Class Name: REL115<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Lots of reading, makes you submit a homework assignment every day. Grades you 3 points a day on participation, hw, and attendance. picky and particular, but no tests, just 3 papers. he's very helpful, but religion isnt my bag, i just practice it, dont like to learn, lol.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2010<br>Class Name: REL264<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cool Guy!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/03/2009<br>Class Name: REL264<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class got really boring at times, and you are required to participate.  BUT the instructor is friendly and knows the material well.  Grades pretty fairly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2009<br>Class Name: REL219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher and not bad to look at. The only problem is that he says ummm.. at least a thousand times within one class period.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/19/2008<br>Class Name: REL219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Sesay knows what he is teaching, which is very refreshing.  There is a lot of reading but if you know the general topic you will be fine for class discussion.  Attend class and write good papers and it is a very fun/easy class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2008<br>Class Name: REL219<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very smart teacher. Tons of reading, but their are only four papers and the prof is a very fair grader. Don't miss any class and you shouldn't have a problem getting a good grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/09/2008<br>Class Name: REL264<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This guy is the best. I wasn't big on his class but it was for other reasons. He's very knowledgable and assigned a lot of great material to read. I learned a lot from him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2008<br>Class Name: REL219<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is an excellent professor! I really learned a lot in this class, and it is not difficult. All there really is, is reading. There are not that many papers (3) and the quizzes were take home. He is also a very understanding professor, and you actually learn something. He only requires what most professors require. I liked him, so I say take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2008<br>Class Name: REL115<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy, but I'm lost A LOT!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/02/2007<br>Class Name: REL264<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Class is pretty easy but IF YOU ARE THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO LIKES TO SKIP CLASS EVERY NOW AND THEN, DON'T TAKE HIM!He only allows one absence per quarter and deducts 3 points for every one after that. I underestimated his policy on absences and skipped some classes. I got A's on EVERY SINGLE PAPER but still came out with a C+ because of this.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/05/2007<br>Class Name: REL260<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you need a REL requirement for your major- DO NOT take him. He is new and actually follows the REL requirements given to him.  A bit unclear and goes on tangents.  I am sure there a lot easier professors for REL. If you like Religious studies- then you will have a blast. Personally- it bored me- SO I Detested learning about it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2006<br>Class Name: ABD215<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher. Has a sense of humor. Very knowledgeable about the subject and helpful. Assigns a very large amount of reading for nearly every class. Discussion sucks if you don't read. You will be lost in class. Likes participation. Very picky on papers. Not an easy grader, but take him. You'll learn something.</div></div></div></body></html>
