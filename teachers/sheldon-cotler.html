    I think he only teaches the internship section for psychology. Tests really aren't given. There is a lot of reading, both the books and articles but if you're going for human services concentraion it's great information. Bring your coffee to class there's a lot of lecturing and discussions.

    So kind, Very willing to help. Very knowledgable. Excellent with the internship program. Takes time to meet with you if you need it. No surprises in his class. What you see is what you get. Highly recommended!
