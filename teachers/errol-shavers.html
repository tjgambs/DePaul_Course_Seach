He tends to read off the slides and provides very little explanation about topics.  It's nice to see that he has real world experience, but we all felt very unprepared for the exams based on the content he delivered.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2014<br>Class Name: MGT322<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Be prepared to be lost and very confused. I must say that he is a nice person, seems to be a smart guy and good at his other job, but teaching is not for everyone, and it is definitely not for this guy. I have never been so lost, like I did in this class. And yes, he is one of those teachers that cannot teach and gives very hard exams and projects</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2014<br>Class Name: MGT301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to learn anything good, don't take this class. Uses my OM lab for homework's and quizzes and reads off off pearson generated slides. Doesn't respond to emails and isn't clear on whats going to be on midterms and finals. Just throws a lot of hw and quizzes at you.</div></div></div></body></html>
