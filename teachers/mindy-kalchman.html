Doesnt make you buy any textbook and makes you very informed about the education system. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. There is a final paper and a paper due almost every week but nothing extreme. The work is very manageable and I loved every second in the class w/ her. Not a blow off class but definitely worth your while.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/14/2010<br>Class Name: EE333<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, she truly understands teaching mathematics and I learned a ton! The person below is obviously lazy and does not care to improve as a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2009<br>Class Name: TL416<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is the worst. Tons of reading & busy work. Something due each week, never get out early and speakers that are unnecessary. End project is long & tedious, requiring you to recall exactly what happened after you teach your lesson. Not sure how you can do that when you're TEACHING. Don't take if possible. Didn't learn anythind math-related.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2007<br>Class Name: EE333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed taking this class. I've never enjoyed mathematics, but I could see myself teaching math now after this class. Mindy is a helpful teacher and I'd recommend taking her class to anyone.  She's also a very sweet woman.  The only somewhat negative thing is that she assigns a lot of readings, however I never read any of them and still got an A.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/31/2006<br>Class Name: EE333<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: TL416<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Excellent Professor!! Very nice! Easy grader as long as you put forth the effort...very interesting!

There were a lot of assignments but she was a pretty fair grader and the assigments were pertinent to the course materials.  I knew nothing about Math before I went into this course but now I think I could actually teach it if I was given a chance.  She explained a lot of things in ways I never thought of.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/06/2005<br>Class Name: TL416<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I expected to hate this class and wound up loving it.  It is a lot of work but she's wicked smart and got a lot of really valuable information from the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2005<br>Class Name: EE333<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>this was one of my worst professor at DePaul. She asked for a lot. She give huge amounts of reading and required 2 5-10 pg papers. In addition you need to observe at a school and give a pre and post review of your experience. Overall a lot of work!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/14/2004<br>Class Name: EE333<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>No Comments</div></div></div></body></html>
