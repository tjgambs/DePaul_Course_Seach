She really cares about the material and tries to get the class to care and know everything she possibly can. Was a bit picky with the reading response papers and final paper but  it makes you a good writer and pay attention to detail. Weekly quizzes but open notes and usually very straightforward. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2014<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Mahoney obviously really loves her job and has a way of making her students interested in the things she teaches.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2014<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: A</div><div id="right"><div>Outstanding.

She is so engaged in not only the course material but with her students as well.  She is extremely knowledgeable and made me grow a keen interest in art history so much so I have since her class made it my minor!!! Take her, no disappointment promise! OH and she is real easy on the eyes too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/02/2013<br>Class Name: HAA231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Probably one of my favorite professors I've ever had at DePaul. She got me so interested in the subject that I've just added a minor in HAA and I'll be taking another one of her classes next quarter. Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/06/2013<br>Class Name: HAA231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I love her! Her passion for art is really contagious; I had never taken an art history course before this one, but she sparked my interest. There's a lot of reading to keep up with if you want to do well on the exams and pop quizzes, but overall it's a really enjoyable class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: HAA231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very energetic, loves the subject matter. Easy quizzes, easy tests, just do the work like you should anyway and there's not problem. Always willing to answer a question or recommend further reading, very approachable.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/11/2012<br>Class Name: HAA231<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Mahoney is fantastic, she really just wants you to understand and enjoy the material. Definitely speak up in class, even if you think your question is trivial, she loves it!

I'm a business major, not into art history, but she made it interesting.  Seemed to know everything about history.  And funny</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2008<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I don't know what the (probably not very bright) person below is talking about.  Prof. Mahoney is EXTREMELY knowledgable-she answers questions on every subject and knows all kinds of interesting information about the people and periods you study.  She's amazing every lecture.  I learned a ton from her. And she's super cute too!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2008<br>Class Name: ART233<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Mahoney is absolutly amazing. Although her class is quite easy (two papers,the midterm/final.. you don't really have to read if you show up and take notes)but she knows a lot about the subject and makes it very clear and interesting to learn. I would recommend her to anyone, I am a poli sci major but loved this ancient art class-Take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/31/2008<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Yes, she is easy but not extremely knowledgable. If you want an easy class, take it, if you want to actaully learn a lot about art, and have someone who knows their art very well, i wouldn't recommend her. she's pretty unsure of a lot of things she talks about, which makes you less interested.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/16/2008<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a great teacher. Very helpful and nice. 1 paper (5 pages), a midterm and a final. Its a great art class, I really learned a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/05/2008<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE IS VERY NICE!! A midterm, final, and one 5 page paper. She's is very helpful and explains things well. Good teacher. Take her if you can.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2008<br>Class Name: ART102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I'm a psych major and because of Prof Mahoney I've recently gained an interest in Roman and Medieval art history. She's awesome. She's extremely knowledeable and very enthusiastic. Must attend class and take good notes. Responsible for about 30 images and their significance at midterm and final. Great teacher.</div></div></div></body></html>
