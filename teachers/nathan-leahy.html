Easy grader and assignments are easy. I took this course to fill an elective and you wont find an easier A anywhere else.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2013<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Incredibly intelligent. Goofy guy who knows how to lead a discussion. VERY EXCITED about the material and that energy rubs off on students. Some of the books were tricky, but if you keep up with the readings and participate, you'll have a great time. Less writing than most literature classes. I would gladly take a class with him again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/05/2013<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Whoever complained about the amount of books read has not taken an English class at DePaul yet. Every english class requires that we read a book a week. We only read 7 anyway. Prof Leahy is awesome, clear, he leads the discussions so that we come to the main conclusions on our own. He is personal and funny. Amazing teacher would take again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/31/2013<br>Class Name: ENG365<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's a nice guy and does his best to teach the material, but I was appalled at the amount of reading he assigned. In a 10 week quarter, he had us read 6 books and "discuss" them. Nothing got accomplished because you cannot thoroughly discuss an entire book in a week. 150-200 pages per class? This amount of reading is not appropriate for ANY class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/28/2013<br>Class Name: ENG265<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Leahy has been the best professor I have had at DePaul. He is very interested in the subject material and tries his best to keep it interesting for his students. Attendance is mandatory, short reflections due throughout the quarter and he was a fairly easy grader.</div></div></div></body></html>
