    I wanted to switch classes because I couldn't understand him through his accent. After getting used to it, the class wasn't that bad. He is thorough in his explanations and helps you if you ask. Attendance is not mandatory but go or you'll fall behind.

    Nearly impossible to understand but he writes everything clearly on the board. His quizzes and midterm are too easy and his final ends up being way too hard. This class was a breeze except for the final which was weighted 40%. He allows notes. Extremely nice and understanding. Would recommend. But beware of the final!!

    This teacher belongs in a community college. You can't understand a word he says, and he can't understand a word you say. Unless you already know the material, you will not pass this class. Even the easy material he made impossible. Take Denis Miller instead!

    Easy easy class. Even if you know nothing about calculus you will do good.  The class is basically designed for you to get an A. The night class gets a little frustrating at times because you cannot understand a thing he says. But don't worry about that because he writes everything he says.

    Probably my favorite teacher of all-time. His class was extremely simple, and I rarely stayed the whole time. He's a little hard to understand, but if you make the effort you will be fine.

    He might be a little had to understand when he talks, but as far as understanding the math it is easy and he is really good at explaining it. you dont have to go, you dont have to do homework, he only grades on tests. tests are harder than what is taught in class though. fun class, easy too.

    Zhang is an awesome professor. Hard to understand at first but you get used to it. Very smart and kind. He was extremely understanding and went out of his way to make sure everyone got the best grade possible. Class was 40% quizes, 20% midterm, and 40% final.

    So you really can't understand him....at all; however the class material is ridiculously easy if you don't understand it your an idiot. His tests are super easy and so is the homework. Yeah and the grading scale is a joke, its pretty amazing. It is a blow off class for sure and you can still get an A. If you have trouble or your upset with a grade
