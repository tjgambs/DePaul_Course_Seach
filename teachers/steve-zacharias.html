Prof Zacharias is the best! All you do is watch movies! Main thing you have to do is write a 12-page script (the setup). That's all! No other work or tests! You'll watch great movies like Iron Man, Moulan Rouge, The Hangover, etc. I looked forward to this class each time! TAKE TAKE TAKE!!!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
