Incredibly funny, knowledgable, and helpful. Never once did he fail to be clear in his expectations and insightful in his lectures. He keeps a very relaxed atmosphere so you'll feel comfortable participating in class from day one. If anybody can find anything negative to say about him, I haven't heard it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/06/2015<br>Class Name: EN120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Gardiner is by far the easiest professor I have had at DePaul, granted I did my work and English has never been a struggle for me. He is clear in his expectations and he is a VERY lenient grader- make sure your papers are on time. He loves to talk about himself and Ireland so some ego-propping never went amiss. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2015<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: A+</div><div id="right"><div>Best teacher DePaul has to offer. So funny and very sarcastic. If you like a teacher that is going to make you laugh your ass off the entire class then this is your guy. He is extremely helpful and knows what he is talking about. No one could possibly have a negative thing to say about him. Class act and even better person. </div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Dr. Gardiner is an awesome professor! His class is a blast and the assignments don't feel like homework. There is a ton of freedom when it comes to choosing topics for your papers, which I loved because then it is easy to bang. Gardiner is overall just an amazing and fun professor. TAKE HIS CLASS</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher</div></div></div></body></html>
