He doesn't clarify his expectations on many of the assignments.  His grading is completely unfair.  Sales isn't a team sport and if you're stuck with a crappy team in his class, you sink with the ship.  He won't assign individual grades, no matter how great your work is.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2011<br>Class Name: MKT379<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Vague assignments and tests. Don't believe I got the grade I deserved.  A bit charming but not a fair grader at all.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2010<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>His grading of the final project did not jive with the guidance he gave as the project progressed. I know my grade would have been higher with better teaching. He will argue a point to the bitter end to defend his opinion. Then ask you to provide proof of your position.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/12/2010<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Don't take this guy if you want a grade you deserve. He will fight you on poorly written test questions and makes this easy class a ton of work with a huge project that he will grade very strictly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/16/2009<br>Class Name: MKT555<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice prof who takes the time to answer your questions. I like that he has lots of real world experience. He gives you a study guide for exams but questions are bizzare, and I don't feel that they tested my knowledge of the material. Don't bother buying the book. Main assn was a large business plan; I'm not sure how much I learned from it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2009<br>Class Name: MKT379<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>When signing up for his class, remember this: He is an extremely hard grader and is not afraid to give you a 0 on an assignment even if the assignment was your own team's fault and not yours.  He also is confusing on what he wants on these assignments and his exams are lengthy.  He is a decent guy but he can change your grade unfairly at any moment</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2007<br>Class Name: MKT398<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worse porfessor in the world. This guy requires too much work for an easy class. Everything that he teaches is common sense. This guy is way too old to be teaching. If you miss one class 10 percent of your overall grade drops.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/31/2007<br>Class Name: MKT300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>he is the nicest man in the world! The tests are a little tricky, but the midterm and final study guides are super helpful. don't buy the book, the slides are all online. i got literally 100% in this class, which i didn't even know was possible in college. its cake.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/30/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Gotta take him cause this is one &quot;cool&quot; guy with real world experience. Short test are very hard; study slides carefully. The study guides for the midterm/final are VERY helpful. Do all the hw, go 2 class, do well on the big tests and you can get away with a B. Seriously, take him, he has a lot of knowledge to share.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/14/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>not as easy as everyone says, need to study for &quot;short&quot; tests, worth big portion of finl grade. overall, good teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/16/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The short exams are difficult if you don't study every single slide carefully. Buying the book is unnecessary - just study off the slides. He grading is straight-forward and I would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>easy class but the guy is a too pompous</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Awesome Prof!Great to learn from someone with real world knowledge and not only book smarts.Highly recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an incredibly interesting man, with a vast amount of elite experience.  He's very interesting, and is a very lenient grader.  Study the Power Points and you're fine; I never once used the book, you really don't need to purchase it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2005<br>Class Name: MKT301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, best option for Mkt301. tells you all the quizes and tests come from the powerpoints so there is no need to purchase book. has a wealth of real world experience and examples. this was my favorite class all quarter.

He knows the subject matter inside and out. This class is beneficial for networking and job search. Too many presentations can be a little boring sometimes.
