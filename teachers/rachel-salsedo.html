She's extremely genuine and clearly loves what she does. Her class is not very hard; if you turn in everything on time you will get an A. If you're struggling, she'll help you with anything!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/23/2014<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: B</div><div id="right"><div>She's a great teacher, really nice and understanding. She also grades off the B contract meaning that if you turn in all the papers and show you're making progress you automatically get a B, so that's nice. She's really into participation, so if you're not into that I wouldn't suggest this class.</div></div></div></body></html>
