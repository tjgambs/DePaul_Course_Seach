SMITH IS AWESOME!!! He is my favorite professor at DePaul by far.  He's always funny, and the lectures are really interesting.  The tests are not bad at all, though you do have to understand what he goes over in class.  The presentations are fun.  This was such a great class and I'd definitely recommend taking him. You won't regret it!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/26/2012<br>Class Name: REL280<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST TEACHER!!!! I've taken 2 classes now with Anthony. One of my favorite professors at Depaul so far. He is so nice and willing to help you with any questions you have. The class involves reading all the material but there are only 2 test and a weekly one page reflection which arent to difficult. He really tries to make class fun and interesting!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/11/2012<br>Class Name: REL280<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really awesome teacher. Great guy, really gets you involved in the lectures and makes them interesting at the same time. Only had two tests and you have to write a small one page paper a week. That may seem tedious but the lowest grade you can get on the paper is an A! Must take if you can!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2012<br>Class Name: PHI100<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best teachers I've had at DePaul. He makes the lectures interesting and understands that not everyone understands philosophical readings. He showed interesting movies that actually tied in with the lectures. He gave two easy quizzes and an essay. Take him if you can!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/16/2012<br>Class Name: CAT249<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Favorite Professor.

He is very knowledgeable about his teachings, and does his best to break down/explain philosophical ideas to the class. He likes to show funny/interesting show clips and movies. He is down to earth, extremely approachable, and always willing to help. Take him if you can.</div></div></div></body></html>
