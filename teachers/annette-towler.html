She likes a good writer so give it your best!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/08/2010<br>Class Name: LSP112<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a funny upbeat person. There is no final but 2-3 page papers per week. She grades the papers very hard. Even if you make her revisions you still wont get an A. She said she barley gave out A's on papers. She grades like this is a 300 level class yet its only a freshman focalpoint. If youre looking for an easy A, than this class is not for you</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/08/2010<br>Class Name: LSP120<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely loved Professor Towler. She is extremely helpful and passionate about her field. The class isn't difficult, but be sure to be involved in the discussions! The class was fun and interesting, and she was very easy to get along with and talk to. Very caring and sweet. Definitely take her!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/05/2010<br>Class Name: PSY105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>SHE WAS THE BEST TEACHER EVER!
