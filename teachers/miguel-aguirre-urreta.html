    The best accounting professor at DePaul by far. Great lectures, fair tests, and practical assignments. Very nice personality. If you will make reasonable effort, you will do great.

    Professor Aguirgre-Urreta is awesome. He is one of the few teachers at DePaul that actually "teach" instead of just reading slides. Lots of reading and casework will keep you engaged. No exams but TONS of busy work. I took it over the summer and it was very time consuming. Hes a great professor and a good guy. You definately have to earn this one.

    Professor Aguirgre-Urreta is awesome. He is one of the few teachers at DePaul that actually "teach" instead of just reading slides. Lots of reading and casework will keep you engaged. Two exams cover quite alot of material and make up about 50% of the grade. Keep up with the reading and cases and you will do well in his class. He really cares.

    Excellent instructor. With the case studies, and discussions in class, he made me interested in this subject I was not interested in before. Highly recommend this class with prof. Miguel!

    Great teacher.  Tries his best to keep the class interesting with case studies and how the topic relates to us.  No mid-term or final.  Weekly quizzes, bi weekly analysis of a current IT development and one presentation.  You'll get an A if you put forth some effort.

    Excellent knowledge on the subject of AIS.  Provides a few too many cases studies but information is interesting and he keeps the class moving along.  Recommend this professor highly.

    I took info systems, and while it wasn't a difficult course, the material was very dry. It didn't help that he constantly read off the PPT slides either.

    This class can be boring and the excel projects he makes you do take hours. Just make sure you read all the chapters before studying and you will do fine on the tests. You have to do a group presentation but just make sure your topic is interesting

    This is probably one of the worst professors I've taken at DePaul so far. Avoid taking him, if possible.

    I wouldn't say the worst, but try to have someone else if you have options, if not, don't sweat it. Again, he's not a disaster!

    I have one advice for ya, KEEP AWAY!! Too sturdy. all he does is reading from the author slides ruining what should be one of the most interesting classes. MIS is my  major and he definitely throws me off the subject. In addition to that, he's got a thick accent which makes it really hard to understand what he's saying.
