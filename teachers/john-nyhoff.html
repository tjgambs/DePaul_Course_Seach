He practically gives you the midterm in advance.  Class can be a little boring but he relates the material with the real world a majority of the time.  He works down at the CBOT and knows his stuff.  He was very helpful outside of class.  I would recommend him.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/28/2008<br>Class Name: FIN567<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Tough class and tough teacher.  Lectures are based on countless power point slides.  Trader speak is a little hard to follow as well.
