A little confusing to understand at times when he talks in this way but other than that he's pretty easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/09/2007<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very relaxed and fun.  He's not condescending at all even though my art project were junk.  Always there to help.  Girls dont wear tight or low cut shirts unless you dont mind the staring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/30/2006<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Aleman is a good guy. He's very nice, easy to get along with, and real chill. In class we listened to music while we did our art work. He helps you become a better artist but he understands if you're not the best. He sees the potential you have. Very cool guy.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/24/2005<br>Class Name: ART104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Aleman is an alright guy. He basically expects you to attempt and implement the concepts he teaches you, but for the most part you can be a free spirit. I enjoyed his class in the begining, and then I started to dread it, only because I lost creativity after some time. Take the class, you will not regret it for the most part.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2004<br>Class Name: ART105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A very nice man.  He just wants you to work to your best artisitic ability.  He does not expect you to be picasso if you aren't able to be.  He's a great teacher and loves art.  I enjoyed the class.  Half teaching/half time to work on projects!  Lots of trips to work sites and museums.</div></div></div></body></html>
