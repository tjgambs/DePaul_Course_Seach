Brilliant introduction to research (and some design thinking) that will server you expertly in your career. A must take for any marketing student!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/07/2013<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I loved loved loved this class and Ms Diamond. She is brilliant. Period. Her class is so well put together, I seriously believe this is the class I learned the most from at DePaul. The readings were most informative, the assignments realistic and she's a fair grader. Highly recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: MKT315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Number crunching and EXCEL were the least exciting parts to me in Marketing. I wanted to only think creative but after her class I realized how much creative depends on looking at the numbers. She is clear to what she wants for this class. Listen take notes and her power points are ridiculously helpful. Great clarity and very helpful if needed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/29/2012<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>truly one of my most memorabile class at DePaul. Professor Diamond has an excellent personality that makes you excited to come to her class. This class was especially great with the readings that really related to real world scenarios. Class participation is a must so its great when you have classmates who really have something to say.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/26/2012<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes nice, but the material was a bit too much considering its a ICS course. There was a ton of material covered, and tests were very challenging. Studying is definitely necessary but she is quite unclear on the requirements. Would not recommend.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/29/2012<br>Class Name: ICS192<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I didn't have a bad experience..but she has definitely changed. Second time taking her and she is way harder than she used to be. This is the first time I have ever gotten anything less than an A-  she gave me a C. nice person, but overly demanding teacher, and expects too much from such a simple class. Don't take if you have a full schedule!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/01/2012<br>Class Name: MKT315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You will learn ALOT in this class. The work load is not bad throughout the quarter. 4 papers which you need to allocate a lot of time for. The last three weeks of the quarter are the toughest with a big group project and a mammoth final you are given a week before its due. It will take you a few days to finish FYI-- other than that I learned alot!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/04/2012<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>A MUST-TAKE professor - simply stated. Prof. Diamond provided some of the most interesting readings, and the in-class discussion was fun and thought-provoking. The workload is manageable (readings & 3 papers), and she is extremely helpful and understanding. Can't stop thinking about the concepts learned in class. One of the best prof's at DePaul!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/20/2012<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>You won't find a more interesting professor at Depaul she is full of interesting stories and view points, we watched many films as well. No course overload, she is aware students are taking other classes</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/29/2012<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do your self a favor and take this class. Let me say, I am an accounting major and I have always found marketing as a subject of folly, but I even found this class to be very useful and interesting. The articles to read for this class are by far the most interesting and enjoyable articles I have read for any class to date.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2011<br>Class Name: MKT528<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Although this is the second course I didn?t get A in Depaul (and the first one because the professor think I have not done a good job), I still strongly recommend this course and prof Nina. She is extremely helpful and knows this area. This course has many readings and much more academic than most courses.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/28/2011<br>Class Name: MKT315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is what made me want to pursue market research as a career. One of the most helpful classes you can take as a marketing major. As long as you do the readings and attend class you will be fine on the group project and final. Attending class is not only mandatory but necessary to understanding the material. Recommended.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 08/18/2011<br>Class Name: MKT315<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Hard class.  Group project is a lot of work.  If you are in group with unreliable people you are sol.  Read and do assignments, she doesn't give you slot of time to complete take home final</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/20/2011<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Diamond keeps this class fun, interesting, and intellectual. This is not a difficult class if you are ready to read and discuss the material. If you are not prepared to read and give incite on intellectual topics, dont bother taking this class. Take this class if you truly want to have a good discussion with a professor that knows her stuff.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/14/2011<br>Class Name: ICS392<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a difficult class when u do the readings. There r only 2-3 papers& she tells u specifics of what she requires so getting an A is a no brainer, unless you don't follow the guidelines bc you are lazy. The readings are many, but there is NO text& its a Sr. class so you should be able to read by now. The teacher is prompt w/ help & easy to talk to</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/06/2010<br>Class Name: MKT537<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Professor!

Not only does she bring her real life marketing experience to the classroom but she cares about those students who are interested in doing well. MKT315 is not an easy class by nature but if you choose to enroll, take Professor Diamond! 3-hour morning classes may be a little rough, but it's worth learning from the best.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/20/2009<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Nina is the best professor I have ever had at DePaul. She makes you be interested in learning marketing. She cares about the students, and she always dress professional in the class. Like most people said, her quizes are kind of challenging, while they help you doing better in the exam. Trust me, take her. She is awesome and helpful!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2009<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Professor Diamond is a nice lady and pretty pleasant in class.

Her test questions were a bit confusing though... despite that the class teaches some pretty easy material be sure to prepare for exams since questions are often ambiguous.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2009<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor was amazing.

Class consists of midterm, final, project, quizzes, and homework. Make sure to read the chapters in the book for the midterm and final. I didn't read for the midterm, got a B-...read the chapters for the final and got a 96% on it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2009<br>Class Name: MKT310<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely credible, very approachable.  She always has a positive attitude in class and helps you in any way. Not a ton of reading or a lot of outside work-but you learn a lot.  If you don't like her class it's probably because you just didn't go.  I got a C in MKT301-and am getting an A in her class.  Definitely take this class with Nina Diamond.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/21/2007<br>Class Name: MKT315<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>PROJECTS ARE HARD BUT SHES A GREAT PROF.

She seems like she has a ton of other projects going on, yet she is the most accessible prof I've had at Kellstadt.
