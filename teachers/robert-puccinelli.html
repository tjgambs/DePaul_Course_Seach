All you have to do is take pictures every week (new assignment weekly), and write a short (very brief) essay about why you chose the uploaded photos. Just do your photo assignments and attend classes and you will do great. Very fair grader, and gives good feedback as well. It was an amazing adventure. Gotta love DC125</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/22/2014<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you miss 4 classes you fail. Its a big work load but is super easy. Have your own camera because the cage will run out very fast.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/30/2014<br>Class Name: DC125<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Very nice teacher. Do the work and you will get a good mark. How much you put in, you get out.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/01/2013<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Got him cuz it said "staff". Makes you peer edit alot. Funny cuz no one in the class cares. So there's no improvement or good feedback. Not the best. Passable if you do the work. Class was fun, but I would trade for a boring one for a better grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2012<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is just as much work as an Accounting class! So much work, many times in lack of communication. If you need help he is willing to help. However be ready for it. He tells you exactly what he wants and how, nothing personal. Okay class, would never take it again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really does try hard. Unfortunately, teaching just isn't his gift. He uses pointless textbook activities and is so unclear about what he wants. He's a fair guy and he's nice, I just would't want to take his class again.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/01/2011<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He really tries to get everyone engaged in class.  Everyone participates because he has cards with everyones name on it.  Fair grader. Overall I liked coming to class because we had a lot of class interesting discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/18/2011<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Initially he was a tad boring, but once he warms up to the class he's hilarious. Socially awkward and nerdy/spazzy, but in an endearing way. The material is really boring, but he does fun group debates and things. I actually liked coming to class!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2010<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He was very nice and very helpful, pretty easy for me</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>i actually like him- he was a blast! i wish he was my uncle or my dad sometimes. i didn't find anything wrong with him; he helped me out a lot and was always interested. just great! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/08/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Confusing professor, poorly organized class-to-class, difficult-to-understand instructions for assignments, very technologically challenged, strict attendance policy, only 2 papers during the class, then a portfolio, uses notecards to call on everyone, tough grader; he's a nice guy, but a bad teacher. I didnt get much out of the class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/24/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst teacher I've had thus far at DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/03/2008<br>Class Name: WRD111<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>At first seems hard and boring. Actually very easy grader. Kinda funny, very nice. You do have to show up for class and participate. kinda spazes out a lot.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Pretty cool class so far.I like this class because i enjoy writing and he just seems to be intresting with good ideas plus he uses the city as a way to learn and i really like that because i like to go places and see it for myself.

He also is pretty understanding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/15/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I like this class because i enjoy writing and he just seems to be intresting with good ideas plus he uses the city as a way to learn and i really like that because i like to go places and see it for myself.

Not the easiest prof. but he does help you if you put in the effort. Not an easy A. I would Recommend him but be careful</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Do not take this guy! He is one of the worst English teachers I have ever encountered. Useless work, disorganized class structure, poor feedback on papers, etc. Overall, you will leave this course more confused (and frustrated) than when you walked in.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2007<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher definitely improved my ability as a writer.  Just try to put out a well thought paper and you will get an A</div></div></div></body></html>
