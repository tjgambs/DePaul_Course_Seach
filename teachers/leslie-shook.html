In the real world&#63; not so much.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/17/2007<br>Class Name: PAM301<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She treats PAM 301, which is about 1/4 of most students' academic obligation, as if it's 95% of the student's total life responsibilities. The unfortunate thing is if you are a Performing Arts Management major, you have to take her class for two quarters because there is no alternative. Brace yourself.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/08/2007<br>Class Name: PAM123<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I am a alumni now. Everyone says once you get out of TTS you understand the value of what seemed so invaluable then. Leslie's class are still invaluable,and believe me I look back for guidance. The post about her teaching Real World Theatre Management, I'm not sure where that student's 'real world' is exactly, but i hope they don't work in the arts</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/12/2007<br>Class Name: PAMPAM<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I learned about management, but I'm not sure if it was from her. Many many many assignments that really aren't that helpful. Lots of memorization. Required attendance at all theatre school performances. Likes to drop names.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/28/2006<br>Class Name: PAM<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I think Leslie is very knowledgable and this is a very worthwhile class.  She really knows her stuff and it the past reviewers paid any attention, they would know that Leslie teaches real world theatre management.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/10/2006<br>Class Name: PAM14<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This woman is a walking mistake. Lets not even talk about her as a person- her as a teacher is sad, pitiful and a waste of t ime. Not only are her assignments not beneficial= they are busy work. She is obsessed with talking about her life and has no true experience other then working at a school theatre- and she is the head of a dept&#63; cmon!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/27/2006<br>Class Name: PAM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I have met worst people on the planet, but the class was not organised whatsoever. Students were sent off to work on some project, & towards the end she changed her mind on the proj. throwing everyones work off.  She will send you on a meaningless wild goose chase. The book was a waste of money since it was only covered in class twice.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/18/2005<br>Class Name: PAM<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Leslie is the stupidest human being the world has, but she thinks she know her stuff. class is all busy work and none of her colleagues respect her.you cant avoid her and the theatre school doesnt care that shes stupid and doesnt know the first thing about theatre mgt. EVERY THEATRE PROFESSIONAL I HAVE WORKED WITH IN CHICAGO HAS SAID THEY HATE HER~</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/27/2005<br>Class Name: PAM301<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is probably the worest teacher, if not human being that I have encountered at DePaul. I would NEVER recommend for anyone. The only problem is that all of the classes she teaches are req. SO MUCH WORK! You have to attend tons of performances. GOOD LUCK!</div></div></div></body></html>
