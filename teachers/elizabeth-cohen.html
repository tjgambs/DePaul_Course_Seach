The professor is very laid back and does her best to ensure that the whole class does well on the exams. She is very helpful after hours. Her exams are basically the homework questions re-hashed. The girl next to me snored through every class and Prof. did nothing. It was quite amuzing.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/01/2008<br>Class Name: MAT150<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She wasn't that hard. She doesn't take attendance or check homework...the only grades are two midterms and a final. She is not a bad professor- calculus is hard, so it's not really her fault if you don't get it. She always answered my questions when I approached her. If you do your homework you should get a decent grade.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2008<br>Class Name: BMS125<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is not a very good teacher. Does the fact that The average grade on the final was a 46% say anything to you&#63; She goes through examples quick and if she is being picked up after class (night class) dont expect to have your questions asnswered. She does alot a lot of time to review homework! so take advantage because the weekly quizes are on h/w.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/02/2007<br>Class Name: BMS126<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She isn't the best Calc prof out there, but not the worst.

She is willing to help you if you don't understand. Attendence not mandatory, tests easy if you get it, puts on a nice curve. She is extremely friendly.

When I showed up and stayed awake in class, she would make mistakes while giving examples on the board. All you need in this class is the text book and you'll do fine.

I basically taught my self using the book. She only curves if you do bad, if you get a 89% she wil give up a B+ and not a A-. Class is extremely boring, very difficult to stay awake...

She has -no- teaching method.  She's lazy; and will not take the necessary steps to help you with her tests.  She is not open to constructive criticism.  Her analogies make no sense.
