She is very nice and understandable. I think in the second week of class she bought the class Cheese Puffs!! She gives clear notes which makes the class easy. Also the activities and homework is very easy. There are no projects just a mid term and final.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/16/2011<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a nice teacher... I was a bit worried when I was entering the class and I read the reviews but honestly, there's nothing wrong with her. She helps you if you're nice about it and you don't constantly ask her. Try to figure things out on your own, come to the lectures, ask questions when appropriate, and try to get to know her...</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/17/2009<br>Class Name: LSP121<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>The worst teacher I have ever had...literally. Freaked out if you asked her a question and gave you a look of disgust, like you should know this. I had her in night class and she would let you out early just because she had to catch the 8pm train...and she didnt care if you were finished or needed help. AVOID HER...shes a strange one</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/13/2006<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Worst class I have ever taken. She does not anwser questions and it is absurd to have a computer class that is never in the computer lab. She teaches the whole class through lectures and too quickly. She knows the information very well but is a terrible teacher! I dropped it and will retake it with another professor!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/15/2006<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Talks to herself, not really caring if students get it. Self-absorbed. Does not answer the questions asked, but some strange interpretation of what she wrongly thinks was asked. A strange class and will warn others.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: IT130<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a good teacher, said what she did last year worked. so she was going to do it again.(&#63;) Moved fast. The whole class was lecture and very little lab (5min) Not helpful when u asked questions, seemed frustrated. Just because u know the material, it doesn't make u a teacher! The class is very boring and she forgets 2 give u breaks.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/15/2004<br>Class Name: HCI201<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>By the far the most boring class I have ever taken. I stoped going to class in the 6th week.

She is the most uniteresting woman alive, who should never teach again. Take her if you want to kill yourself from boredom. Never attended class, because that's how bad it was. She is a very strict grader!!!!!!!</div></div></div></body></html>
