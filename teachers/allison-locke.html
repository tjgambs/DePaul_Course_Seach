I would admit there were days where the class meetings just seemed to drag on forever, but overall she helped improved my writing a lot! The midterm and final are essentially easy if you pay attention. I'd recommend Locke to anyone!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Allison is a good professor. Like others have said, her class is a lot more work than other classes, but if you are willing to put up the work she will help improve your writing. The constant focus on history got extremely old to me, simply because I'm not a fan of history. She does know what she is talking about, just be prepared for a workload!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2010<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is one of the very few teachers that chooses good stuff to discuss in class. She makes you go through boot camp with the little assignments but for the final papers she is very straight forward so a good grade is not hard.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Allison is a young, funny writing professor, but her expectations in each of your papers are unclear. She doesn't provide you a rubric and expects you to write a 4-5 page current MLA style paper without much background knowledge. Our class' work was compared to a journalist of the DePaulia, and a LOT of us received poor grades.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2009<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She really dose help you improve your writing. She actually made class fun and her projects were actually things students want to learn about. Overall wonderful teacher!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not necessarily the easiest class I've taken. It is definitely more challenging than most WRD classes. She is nice and funny, but a stiffler for useless details such as the newest 2009 rules for MLA. She integrated interesting articles, videos, and photos which made it bearable. The concentration on social justice got really old.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/01/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Overall, I liked her a lot but I didn't necessarily LOVE the class. She was smart, funny, and witty. She maintained my interest for the most part but I felt as if the class consumed too much of my time. EVERY WEEK: lengthy readings, an in-class writing assignment on them (you actually have to read), live journal posts/comments, and a paper due.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2009<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I enjoyed her class. If you try you will get an excellent grade. Livejournal is very important and you have a journal due every Friday. Its no particular length just your opinion. She is very intelligent and young. If you have the chance, TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/17/2009<br>Class Name: WRD102<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I absolutely loved her. She is very smart & very willing to help.  All her assignments are very interesting. As long as you show up and keep up with the work you will get a good grade. participation is not really important - she is more into your writing. I loved this class and her, def reccomend!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/12/2009<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>OK basically you pick a topic to write a paper on. and throughout the whole coarse you keep re writing the same paper.once you build it up to 4-5 pages its downhill from there. just do research and thats it. there are in class wrtiting assignments and this blogging thing on live journal. its alright. over all you can manage it. she is very nice tho</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/07/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is really demanding but if you keep up you shouldn't have a problem... The fact that she makes you keep writing it over and over again it helps!  I would love to take another class with her, I did improve my writing and she is extremely helpful and understanding!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/29/2008<br>Class Name: WRD104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's demanding, but she's also fair and really, really smart. Talk to her if you're having trouble--she's always willing to help. Has a great classroom presence and a terrific sense of humor. Some people might be put off by the workload, but this is college, right&#63;</div></div></div></body></html>
