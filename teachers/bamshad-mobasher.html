He is very well spoken and articulate. Also not a tough grader</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/04/2012<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This isn't his area of expertise but he was still very interested in the topic. He did a good job of engaging everybody and bringing in tons of guest speakers to talk about Labor History. The class was very easy, I'd recommend it.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/11/2011<br>Class Name: CSC575<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Good for information retrieval</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/13/2008<br>Class Name: ECT584<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Among the best in Data Mining.

It was a slacker class, he knows what he's talking about, but it was tough to make the stuff interesting, as a matter of fact, i don't know what i learned. just go to class and stick with it, no tests, just final paper and homework assignments. No books are needed.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/17/2006<br>Class Name: ECT584<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is one of the best in this area.The slides of his presentations are wonderful and designed very carefully.The assignments are some how time consuming but worth doing them as you learn many things.The assignmet are designed very thoroughly.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/13/2006<br>Class Name: ECT584<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is perfect</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2006<br>Class Name: ECT584<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great Teacher.
