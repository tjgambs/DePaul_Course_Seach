Totally cares about his students and is committed to truly educating them.  You have to do the reading (and there's a fair amount of it) before class, otherwise you're wasting your time. Not an easy A, but totally worth the work.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2014<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an okay professor but he sucks at keeping the class motivated. He's really vague and if you ask him a question he doesn't do a good job at answering it. I think he's a pretty easy teacher just extremely boring.

If you have not been fortunate enough to be in one of his classes, I would suggest doing so. He doesn't make earning an A easy however you will learn more from his lectures than any class DePaul has to offer.  Take thorough notes, READ, and participate in discussions.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/15/2013<br>Class Name: LSP110<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really hard teacher and you have to do the readings, make sure you keep every document that he gives you and you bring them all to class.

Do not be fooled. Participation is 50% of the grade and it is ENFORCED. If you don't constantly talk everyday he knocks a half letter off your final grade. Also gives 75+ pages of reading every night. Kind and funny, but not with grades</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/09/2012<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He's an ok professor, but its all lecture.

However, he gives out less then a handful of A's per class. He also requires a lot of reading and is certainly a really though grader.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/27/2011<br>Class Name: PSC347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow he does look a lot like actor Harrison Ford.

However, he really isn't that much fun. The class was mildly interesting, lectures can get dull and off-track. Easy-grader as long as you have some idea of the texts and take good notes.

I attended every class and did absolutely all of my work, and received a C, along with most of the class, both smart and dumb, lazy and hardworking.  Its SO freakin infuriating and annoying. It's like he wants to seem like a hardass.  Oh, and he RAMBLES LIKE CRAZY. boring.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/25/2011<br>Class Name: PSC140<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great teacher, its all lecture, but he makes it very interesting and relates everything to issues we relate to.

This is a class that you actually have to pay attention to and speak up in or else your grade will suffer. He is sort of tough but it was an interesting class and he tried to make it fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/07/2010<br>Class Name: PSC301<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>aSdsdsf</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/20/2010<br>Class Name: PSC347<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>BEST CLASS AT DEPAUL!!

The class very straight forward. 4 books, 4 papers (3-5pg.) plus some participation and you have yourself a decent grade.

He is an AMAZING teacher, cares deeply about his students, very friendly, funny and extremely helpful! Yes, his classes are challenging, but rewarding! If you read, show up on time, and turn in grammatically correct and well thought out papers, you will do well! Take him!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/11/2009<br>Class Name: HON201<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>GREAT professor!

He uses big words to clarify things (which is sometimes annoying. I would have liked him to be more colloquial) but overall I liked him. He was really understanding. I got a very bad grade on our first paper and he suggested I rewrite it. He gave me two weeks to do so.
