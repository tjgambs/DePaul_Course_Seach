She's completely crazy and she has lessened my interest in Spanish which is unfortunate since I want it to be my minor. She's a tough grader but that's not why I don't like her. Her assignments are useless and if anything my Spanish has gotten worse since I started this class. Honestly, a waste of my time and money.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/04/2009<br>Class Name: SPN314<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Hara is interesting, hilarious, and a great asset to DePaul.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/12/2008<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>LOVE HER. I laughed the entire class. Def. taking her for 105. Lessons not organized but gets point across. A little homework, need to study a bit for tests, attendance mandatory and strictly enforced! Easy A, amazing woman - TAKE HER!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2008<br>Class Name: SPAN203<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she cracks me up! and she is veerryyyy intelligent - you will learn a lot, not just speaking spanish. she went out of her to help me and my class partner schedule our oral midterm  (she did it over her lunch hour!) she covers what needs to be covered and is willing to explain assignments partially in english to make sure nobody gets screwed</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/26/2007<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is pretty crazy and an interesting person.

She's really into her subject and is rather funny. I had her for 105 as well, and she helped get me into the appropriate level and even wrote my letter for Madrid. She keeps class interesting and definitely supported my love of spanish! We even learned flamenco.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/14/2007<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Took 104 & 105 with her and it has been a pleasure. She's funny and actually cares about the students. Homework includes learning vocab and 2 writing (1/2- 1pg) assignments on topics from the chapters. Easy class though the grammar explanations aren't the most formal she tries to get the point across. Great class ur guaranteed at very least a B.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/29/2007<br>Class Name: SPN251<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is AWESOME for those who are interested in Spanish & the medical field. Prof is my favorite and very easy going, sweet and just cute. You'll love her light, high voice. Lots of class participation and vocabulary but all will be used. RECOMMENDED 100%!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/07/2006<br>Class Name: ISP101<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof. Hara is so smart and down to earth. her extensive knowledge of Goya was very impressive and i really learned a lot. i will miss her!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 04/19/2006<br>Class Name: SPN320<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cutest little thing ever. She has a French/Spain accent and has a voice like the Swan on MADTV and makes funny faces/gestures. Very understanding and truly cares about her students with brief quizzes and projects. Definitely recommended for other students.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: SPN105<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's very entertaining with her amusing sound effects and facial expressions. She was okay in explaining gramatics, but sometimes things were left unsettled and unclear. She has a very Barcelonian accent with the &quot;th&quot; sound in place of &quot;z's&quot;, but otherwise speaks very clearly. Good teacher, my favorite out of the spanish teachers so far.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/21/2006<br>Class Name: SPN104105<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>she's a riot. extremely energetic and a little on the loca side. tests arent too bad altho theres usually a lot of writing. sometimes shes not very clear about what shes teaching, tho. if ur up for a good laugh every once in a while, take her</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/13/2006<br>Class Name: SPN307<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is such a great teacher; I would take her again if she was teaching a 300-level class. I learned so much in her class; she is very helpful. Her assignments and projects are short and sweet.  Even though there is lots of information in this class; she makes it very clear and short; so no worries for the test.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/06/2006<br>Class Name: SPN300<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very friendly teacher I think that she is great always willing to help.

Can't believe some do not like her.  Tiny assigments, straightforward tests and fast-moving class.  Easiest class I have (and my Spanish skill is only so-so).  A safe and non-extreme class.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/16/2005<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>nice lady, funny in class, but cannot explain the material or what she wants very clearly. class is easy if you know spanish (which kind of defeats the purpose of the class, but ok)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2005<br>Class Name: SPANISH<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 2<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Shes a very outgoing and energetic teacher...she reminds me of the people on the spanish channel that are crazy!! but if you dont know any spanish i dont recomend it because she very rarely talks in english to explain what shes teching you in spanish which gets very frusturating!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/10/2005<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>boring class, and she doesn't know how to explain things. makes herself available outside of class and does speak in english sometimes in class, but she's just as confusing then as she is in spanish.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/07/2005<br>Class Name: SPN104<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Cannot teach at all!
