Definitely taker her.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/24/2008<br>Class Name: WRD103<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Prof Cramond is a great teacher! I had her for WRD and I loved it. I would recommend taking her class. She's extremely easy to talk to, ready to help whenever, and cracks jokes just like a student which makes the classroom environment less stressful. She's a fair grader, explains everything well, and is really understanding. I loved the class.</div></div></div></body></html>
