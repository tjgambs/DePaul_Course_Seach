He doesn't communicate with his students whatsoever. He'll begin lecturing without even telling students what page he is on. He doesn't go over what is on the test to make sure students understand the material. This guy is super smart, but that doesn't make him a good teacher. HORRIBLE!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 01/05/2015<br>Class Name: SPN311<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>He is a really nice guy, but don't use TU with him, always USTED</div></div></div></body></html>
