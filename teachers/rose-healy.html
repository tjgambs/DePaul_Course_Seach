She is so boring that no one ever showed up to class. There was a group project and two tests. The work itself is easy but she is not a fair grader at all. I do not reccommend her as a teacher.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/09/2008<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>I really enjoyed this class. I thought it was really interesting and I thought that she did a good job at teaching it. She did get kind of boring at times... but what teacher doesn't! I would take another class with her given the chance! :)</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 11/06/2007<br>Class Name: COM212<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Wow...Where do I start&#63; This woman will put you to sleep. Bring a pillow. Se has the most annoyng voice I have ever heard. I cannot believe she is allowed to teach. What a waste of my money. She sits in front of the class and reads the book...What is this...Kindergarten&#63; She never responds to emails. HORRIBLE PROFESSOR. Cant even work a VCR.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/04/2007<br>Class Name: CMN101<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 2<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Not a very good teacher- didn't keep me captivated in the least, although then again the material wasn't interesting, she did nothing with it. Only one class assignment and a test.  Easy enough, just very uninteresting.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/22/2006<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>If you want to get a solid A in this class... Look somewhere else.  All I have to say is that I got a 188/200 for the class - 94%.  To her that's an A-.  Total BS.  She can't teach either; her lectures get very tedious.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2006<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 3<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 3<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Grades on points (out of 200 points) instead of percentages meaning if you get 16 mistakes total in ur exam, paper, & group project.. say goodbye to being a straight A student.  If you get 184 over 200 w/c is 92% you get B+.Class participation & attendance are not required & don't count as an add'l points. I suggest you take ur 3 allowed absences.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/23/2006<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class was super easy...completely blow off. I guess people think she's nice but she was very unfair to our group and she responded to e-mails like two weeks later. you won't learn a thing in this class but it's easy</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/22/2006<br>Class Name: COMMUNICATIONS<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>does not respond to emails and concerns, allows for your group members to significantly affect your grade (30 points out of 200 is group evaluations) i did all my work, aced my tests, but my group gave me a low grade for no reason and i ended up without an A that i deserved.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/15/2006<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 1<br>Clarity: 1<br>Easiness: 1<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>pointless</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/17/2006<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 2<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She's a nice lady and this is a really stupid class...but it's an easy credit</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/25/2005<br>Class Name: CMN211<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Really nice lady!

Easy class, and was kinda fun.  No public speaking/presenting what-so-ever.  Just study the few notes you'll have, and skim the bolded words in the chapters for a few things she might have left out of the lecture.  Studying for 45 mins guarantees you an A, I would say ^^.  Go go Rose!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/09/2005<br>Class Name: CMN221<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Rose was great! Take notes and skim the readings. The class discussions are interesting. She tries hard to get everyone invloved. Great CMN credit!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/18/2005<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Easy Course, 4 Exams from a text (25-30 M.C.), but the questions are not difficult, mainly common sense.  1 Community Service project & 5 page &quot;Group&quot; paper, your graded is on the paper not the project, lots of B.S. in the paper.  Overall, Easy and Enjoyable!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/10/2005<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She was a really nice teacher and the tests we took were based completely on the BOOK and notes. The class was overall really easy and the community service project was kinda fun.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 03/07/2005<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This is such an easy class. Don't take any other professor for this course.  The test are based on class notes so don't waste $60 to buy the book.  Very fun class and not demanding.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 02/07/2005<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This class is very easy.  Quizzes are a breeze and the only worry you have is the community service project, but that isn't bad either.  Very helpful and enthusiactic, although her examples are sometimes repetitive.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/14/2004<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Great professor. She is very helpful and it's an easy class. Just show up and participate. Her tests are very and she pretty much lets you know what will be on the test. She does talk a lot, but as long as you participate you'll be fine.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 10/22/2004<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>This professor is extremely flexible when it comes to due dates. She also has a great attendance policy. Participation matters because she talks a lot, so show your face every now and then. Would take her again and again if I could!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 09/08/2004<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very nice teacher.  It is hard not to get an A.  We spent a lot of time in our small groups and had basically every Friday off.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 07/28/2004<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>She is a very easy teacher and the assignments that she gives out is pretty easy. The only problem is she might talk to you to death, (especially during the movies she shows), sometimes she just seems to go on forever but shes a pretty cool teacher though</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/23/2004<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 4<br>Clarity: 4<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Extremely easy course. Read the text and review lecture notes and you will ace the tests! Final was a little tricky but overall 1/2 the time she talked and the other half we worked on a community service project within our groups. It was actually fun!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 06/15/2004<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 4<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>One of the best classes ever. Easy teacher & assignments. Most of the time spent in your small group working on a service project which is real simple. 4 tests about 25-40 questions each scantron. Few lectures. No speeches only small group stuff. Easy!!!!</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 05/13/2004<br>Class Name: CMN212<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 5<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Just take this class! You won't regret it. One of the easiest courses that could possibly be in college.</div></div></div><div id="container"><div id="left">Date: 12/06/2003<br>Class Name: CMN220<br>Helpfulness: 5<br>Clarity: 3<br>Easiness: 5<br>Grade Received: N/A</div><div id="right"><div>Only 4 speeches the whole quarter.  If you bomb one, your grade is ruined.  However, she is nice and very easygoing.  She can grade inconsistently.</div></div></div></body></html>
