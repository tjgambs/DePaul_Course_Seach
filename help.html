	<h2 align="left" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 12px;">
	1) Choose the course prefix you are looking for.<br />
	2) If you know the course number, enter that into the number input box to narrow down the search results. If you do not know the course number, no problem, mocksched will display all courses available within that prefix.<br />
	3) After searching, choose the course you are looking for by pressing the course title.<br />
	4) Interact with the data on the course page by clicking the headers of the table. To sort multiple columns at once, simply hold down shift and click different headers. For example, let's say you want to arrange all open classes by professor ranking. Easy, hold down shift and click the "Class Status" header then the "Overall Rating" header. Voila! <br />
	5) Pressing "+" in the leftmost column will place that selected course into a specialized course cart located in the top right.<br />
	6) After adding courses you want to your course cart, you can create a mock schedule. Press "Mock Schedule" and you will automatically be scrolled to the mock schedule. If you want to remove a course simply press "-" in the table and re-click "Mock Schedule" for your new schedule. You can also view the required books by pressing "Required Books." If you click on a book cover or book title, a new tab will open with that book ready for purchase on Amazon. <br /><br />
