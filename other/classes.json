Contemporary ideas about creativity are often tied to images of the past - from mad scientists to mystical muses. But modern science tells us something else about the creative mind.

Meanwhile, local and regional expressions of Christianity reflect the influence of the cultures with which they have interacted.

The course will investigate how Western Christianity may have contributed to the various cultural phenomena that are associated with globalization.

as considered in the context of the global community. Multiculturalism includes questions of ethnicity, race, class, gender, language, religion, and sexual orientation. Courses pay attention to the history of multiculturalism; examine the experiences and perspectives of at least three distinct cultural groups; develop a critical perspective about meanings of multiculturalism; and investigate the historical roots of inequalities related to differences in class, ethnicity, gender, age, language, religion, ability, and sexual orientation. Topics of seminars vary and students select a course that interests them. Students can complete only one course numbered LSP 200.

Particular emphasis will be given to the process of revision as they learn to write to demonstrate competence, develop their ideas, refine their writing, and give feedback to others. The course assumes a basic understanding of English grammar. Note that SNL does not accept transfer courses for the L4 competence; however, students who feel their writing is particularly strong and have examples of their writing should consider taking the L4 Proficiency Exam to satisfy the L4 Competence.

COMPETENCE/CRIME, PUNISHMENT AND THE CITY", "For almost 150 years, Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment has been recognized as an important work of world literature. At its core, this novel asks questions that are still relevant today. Some of these questions include:\r\n-How can families survive in an urban environment? \r\n-How do people justify violence and neglect? \r\n-Should we allow a person's mental state to influence their punishment?\r\nOf course, these questions only represent a starting place for our investigations of this novel. All students will examine how society and the city shape the behavior of individuals in a series of essays written in a variety of writing genres.  Students who take the class for the A4 competence will supplement this exploration of the novel with their personal experience and ideas developed by thinkers like Lev Tolstoy, Michel Foucault and Martin Buber.\r\n\r\nThe skills you learn in this class are widely applicable and will help you improve your business and other writing. However, we will focus particular attention on writing to excel in SNL's writing-intensive curriculum. You will learn strategies for combining experience with analysis and reflection in writing, managing the writing process, working effectively with sources, and writing persuasively. You will also practice using writing as a tool for exploring as well as communicating your ideas. Particular emphasis will be given to the process of revision as you learn to write to demonstrate competence, develop your ideas, refine your writing, and give feedback to others. The course assumes a basic understanding of English grammar. It carries four tuition credit hours. Note that SNL does not accept transfer courses for the L4 competence; however, students who feel their writing is particularly strong and can provide examples should consider taking the L4 Proficiency Exam to satisfy the L4 Competence.", [{"units_minimum": "2", "first_name": "Nicholas", "last_name": "Hayes", "sat": "N", "wed": "Y", "topic_descr": "L4 /WRITNG FOR COMP/CRIME &amp; PU", "class_section": "801", "fri": "N", "meeting_time_start": "1/1/1900 5:45:00 PM", "facility_descrshort": "", "start_dt": "1/4/2016 12:00:00 AM", "tues": "N", "thurs": "N", "class_nbr": "26503", "location_descr": "Loop Campus", "sun": "N", "meeting_time_end": "1/1/1900 9:00:00 PM", "end_dt": "3/19/2016 12:00:00 AM", "enrl_stat": "O", "mon": "N"}, {"units_minimum": "2", "first_name": "Nicholas", "last_name": "Hayes", "sat": "N", "wed": "Y", "topic_descr": "A4 /WRITNG FOR COMP/CRIME &amp; PU", "class_section": "802", "fri": "N", "meeting_time_start": "1/1/1900 5:45:00 PM", "facility_descrshort": "", "start_dt": "1/4/2016 12:00:00 AM", "tues": "N", "thurs": "N", "class_nbr": "26504", "location_descr": "Loop Campus", "sun": "N", "meeting_time_end": "1/1/1900 9:00:00 PM", "end_dt": "3/19/2016 12:00:00 AM", "enrl_stat": "O", "mon": "N"}, {"units_minimum": "2", "first_name": "Nicholas", "last_name": "Hayes", "sat": "N", "wed": "Y", "topic_descr": "A1A/WRITNG FOR COMP/CRIME &amp; PU", "class_section": "803", "fri": "N", "meeting_time_start": "1/1/1900 5:45:00 PM", "facility_descrshort": "", "start_dt": "1/4/2016 12:00:00 AM", "tues": "N", "thurs": "N", "class_nbr": "26505", "location_descr": "Loop Campus", "sun": "N", "meeting_time_end": "1/1/1900 9:00:00 PM", "end_dt": "3/19/2016 12:00:00 AM", "enrl_stat": "O", "mon": "N"}]], ["LL 270 CRITICAL THINKING", "In this course, students are introduced to the basic concepts behind the skills of effective listening, dynamic thinking, and persuasive argumentation and have an opportunity to practice these skills within an active and experiential context.

To function successfully in this role, the nurse must understand the relationship between: a) pathophysiologic mechanisms and manifestations of disease, b) the fundamental principles of drug action, c) the application of specific drugs in the treatment of disease, and d) related nursing care considerations. The course recognizes the importance of patient teaching as a nursing function and provides greater emphasis on this topic.
