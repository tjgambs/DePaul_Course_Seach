These static and dynamic models are used to understand interactions in the macroeconomy, and will serve as a tool in predicting the level of GDP, inflation, unemployment and interest rates. Models included are: traditional short-run Keynesian analysis; the New Classical market-clearing approach; and the recent work in Neo-Keynesian thought.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>11:50 AM</td><td>1:20 PM</td><td>501</td><td>25043</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
