This course will expand that definition to also explore the technological, cultural, and political aspects of literacy from the earliest archeological record of writing to modern information technology and digital literacy. Students will examine practices and narratives surrounding literacy, learn how both physical media and social power constrain what information gets recorded and how, and question the implications of these constraints on the ways we define and engage literacy and writing.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Matthew</td><td>Pearson</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20728</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr>
