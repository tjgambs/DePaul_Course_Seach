Students also learn about university life, resources, and strategies for academic success. Learning is accomplished through a variety of means including first-hand observation, active participation, personal discovery, reflection, discussion, and encounters with Chicagoans both in the classroom and on excursions. Students select from a variety of Chicago-related topics. First-year students must register to take either LSP 110 (Discover Chicago) or LSP 111 (Explore Chicago) during their first quarter at DePaul. Students will receive credit for only one section of Chicago Quarter (Discover or Explore). Courses are offered during the Autumn Quarter and are available to first-year students only; limited additional sections are offered later in the year. Formerly ISP 102.
