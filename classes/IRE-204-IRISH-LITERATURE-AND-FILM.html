Our study will begin with the writings of the Irish Revival and move on to contemporary fiction so as to establish an artistic base from which to investigate recent interpretations and adaptations of these materials. Then, after addressing the fundamental question "what is an Irish Film (The Quiet Man);" we will go on to a topical analysis of works dealing with central issues in the Irish cinema: politics (Michael Collins, The Wind That Shakes The Barley, The Crying Game, In the Name of the Father); urban life (The Commitments, Intermission); dystopia (Adam & Paul, The Butcher Boy), alienation, and other topics as appropriate.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/david-gardiner.html">5.0</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/david-gardiner.html">David</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/david-gardiner.html">Gardiner</a></td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>801</td><td>27058</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
