We like to watch people be funny.  AMERICAN FUNNY is a survey course that looks at American comedy in theatre from the early 20th century to the present day.  We view performances of plays on video, read and write about American plays and playwrights, and discuss what is special about going to the theatre.  We explore a historical progression of comedy, different types of comedy, the development of the American Comic Hero, and how comedy brings us together as theatregoers and as Americans.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/james-sherman.html">3.1</a></td><td>Closed</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/james-sherman.html">James</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/james-sherman.html">Sherman</a></td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>25398</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
