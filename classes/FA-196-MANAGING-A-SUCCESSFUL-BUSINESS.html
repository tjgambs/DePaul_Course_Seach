More than one business has been put out of business when it experienced unplanned rapid growth. Students learn the financial and management aspects of business along with techniques for defining financial tracking methodologies that uncover and deal with potential problems at an early stage. Special emphasis is placed on merger and acquisition as a forward-looking method for creating new business opportunities and success. Students will work in groups to understand the detailed realities associated with being on the seller and buyer side of a business sale/purchase. Methods of post sale business integration are also discussed. It is strongly recommended but not required that students take "Starting a Successful Business" before taking this class.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Edward</td><td>Paulson</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>801</td><td>24091</td><td>Naperville Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Edward</td><td>Paulson</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>802</td><td>24092</td><td>Naperville Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Edward</td><td>Paulson</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>803</td><td>24093</td><td>Naperville Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Edward</td><td>Paulson</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>804</td><td>24094</td><td>Naperville Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
