It examines the theory and practice of traditional or standard methods of teaching world languages (e.g., communicative approach, natural approach, etc.) with an emphasis on developing alternative, post-method strategies and using diverse resources, as well as on reformulating world languages instruction to integrate subject matter content into the curriculum, including science, social studies, math, fine arts, etc. Engages candidates in understanding and applying the ?Five Cs? - Communication, Cultures, Connections, Comparisons, and Communities outlined in the national standards - toward this end. Lesson and unit development, evaluation/assessment, and classroom management also will be discussed. Issues that emerge in planning and instruction are discussed and deliberated through university classroom experiences as well as required fieldwork (20/15 hours; level 1 in language of certification).<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-johnston.html">4.55</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-johnston.html">Mark</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-johnston.html">Johnston</a></td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>201</td><td>24590</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
