It continues to introduce the students to the study of language and culture of German speaking countries. The course focuses on the development of all four critical language skills--listening, reading, writing and speaking--while also introducing aspects of German-speaking societies that differ from American society. In-class work will be devoted primarily to communication activities, so that students will be able to utilize the structures and vocabulary to express themselves meaningfully and to function in a German-speaking setting.To maximize each student's engagement with the language, students will be talking and listening to each other as much as to the instructor. At the end of the three-course sequence, students will be in command of the basic elements of German language and culture, and should be able to function with relative ease in German-speaking countries. Students will be able to comprehend and engage in basic conversations, write clearly and effectively in German, and read simple but genuine texts.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20466</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Arthur</td><td>Grauman</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>202</td><td>20467</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Birgit</td><td>Geigerhilk-Downs</td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>203</td><td>20468</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
