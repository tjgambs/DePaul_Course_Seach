Students will also be exposed to current issues in animal welfare, including a volunteer experience in an animal shelter. Faculty will provide a framework for assessing the roles and condition of animals, particularly domestic animals, in our culture.  Assigned readings range from Peter Singer's noted work on animal experimentation Animal Liberation to excerpts from Black Elk Speaks, a Native American treatise on hierarchy and respect for life in American aboriginal culture.  Students will pursue their own interests through further readings and commentary.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/betta-losardo.html">2.0</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/betta-losardo.html">Betta</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/betta-losardo.html">LoSardo</a></td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>802</td><td>24011</td><td>Off Campus</td><td></td> </tr></table></body></html>
