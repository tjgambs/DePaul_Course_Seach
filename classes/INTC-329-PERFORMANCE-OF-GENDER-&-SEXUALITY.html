Using aesthetic performance as a point of entry, students will view, analyze, and generate performance work that interrogates the communicative, political, and transformative potentials of embodied actions. With an emphasis on the intersections of gender and sexuality, the course will move through three units of reading, discussion, viewing, and performance creation.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Dustin</td><td>Goltz</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>25958</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr>
