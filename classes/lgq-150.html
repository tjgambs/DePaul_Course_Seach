It will also help prepare students for study in the various fields covered by the electives required for the minor. The course will be taught by faculty from a variety of disciplines and thus undoubtedly shift emphases somewhat with every offering. Topics will include: introduction to and definition of LGBTQ Studies as a field; historical roots of LGBTQ communities in the US and elsewhere; theoretical models of sexuality and gender; contemporary issues in LGBTQ politics and culture.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Donald</td><td>Opitz</td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>801</td><td>21071</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
