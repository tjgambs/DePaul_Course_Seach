The course provides the analytical framework necessary to conduct a category review and make strategic recommendations to both manufacturers and retailers.  The Department of Marketing partners with a number of major consumer packaged goods (CPG) manufacturers and retailers who provide data for analysis.  In addition to working on real data, students learn how to use advanced software such as Nielsen's Category Business Planner, Homescan, InfiNet and Spaceman.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Daniel</td><td>Strunk</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26803</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
