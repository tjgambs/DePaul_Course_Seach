The Federal Reserve has (and other central banks have) the capacity to directly control interest rates and the monetary base (money supply) with an impact on real output growth, unemployment, inflation and financial stability. The expected movement in these variables is important for business and consumer decisions.  The Fed has been criticized as of late for policies that put us into the recent financial crisis and for policies that do not appear to be getting us quickly out of the current slowdown, but instead are setting the country up for higher inflation.  This course will focus on the theory and evidence of what the Fed does (and other central banks do), why they do it and how what they do affects our well-being. It is meant to demystify their policies by providing a rationale behind their statements and actions. Unlike most courses that rely on textbooks, this course will have numerous topics and readings that do not yet appear in traditional texts. Consequently, it will include some of the latest (over the last couple of years or months) ideas on what central banking is and should be about.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/timothy-opiela.html">3.65</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/timothy-opiela.html">Timothy</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/timothy-opiela.html">Opiela</a></td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>25171</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
