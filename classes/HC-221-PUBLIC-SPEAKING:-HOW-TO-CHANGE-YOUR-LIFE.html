Mastery of this skill is critical to one?s professional and personal advancement. Being able to confidently, effectively and enthusiastically deliver your thoughts and ideas to a group of individuals is a skill that separates leaders from followers.  We will explore creative ways to significantly enhance our comfort level speaking effectively in front of groups.  In an open, friendly, fun, enthusiastic and supportive environment, participants will be introduced to a variety of methods to become much more confident with public speaking.

Since fear of speaking is the most significant roadblock to giving effective presentations, this will be a focus of the class.  We learned to feel this fear from our conditioning, which gave us disempowering values, beliefs and thoughts about this activity.   These values, beliefs and thoughts, which we subconsciously inherited and adopted as our own, are likewise responsible for everything else that is or is not working in our lives.   Understanding this power of our minds and our ability to implement new, more empowering values, beliefs and thoughts, is critical to creating the life we desire.

This public speaking course will use Personal Development as the instrument to improve our ability to speak in front of a group as well as identify shortcomings in our personal and/or professional lives and develop a plan for empowerment to make significant changes in these areas.

Student will have an opportunity to speak at each class as there will be 3 short prepared speeches and impromptu speaking during other sessions.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>2</td><td>John</td><td>McLaughlin</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>26474</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr><tr><td>2</td><td>John</td><td>McLaughlin</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>802</td><td>26475</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr><tr><td>2</td><td>John</td><td>McLaughlin</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>803</td><td>26476</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr>
