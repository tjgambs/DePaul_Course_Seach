There will be an emphasis on the interrelationship of all aspects of language, oral and written, that result in literacy as a meaning-making tool in the construction of content-area knowledge. The course will discuss specific aspects of literacy processes from a multicultural, multilingual perspective as they apply to a variety of school settings in general and urban schools in particular. Students will become acquainted with theoretical issues as well as a wide range of literacy-teaching strategies including reading, writing, research, and study skills to be tailored to the needs of different students and to be applied across a variety of learning situations and text types. 30 Level 2 Field Experience hours.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Ravi</td><td>Hansra</td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>801</td><td>24496</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/christopher-worthman.html">2.4</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/christopher-worthman.html">Christopher</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/christopher-worthman.html">Worthman</a></td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>802</td><td>24497</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
