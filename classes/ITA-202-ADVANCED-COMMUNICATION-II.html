The 200-level sequence creates opportunities for students who already have significant background in Italian to make progress in all four areas of language acquisition (reading, understanding, writing and speaking). This quarter will focus on Italian culture and society through history. Students will also review Italian grammar as students work on their language skills through class discussion and targeted assignments. ITA 106 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/daniela-cavallero.html">5.0</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>20527</td><td><a href = "../teachers/daniela-cavallero.html">Daniela</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/daniela-cavallero.html">Cavallero</a></td><td>4:20 PM</td><td>5:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20527</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
