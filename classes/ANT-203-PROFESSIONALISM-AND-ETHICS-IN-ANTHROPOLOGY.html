Students will learn about specialized resources for anthropologists (web resources, library resources, funding resources, career resources), and become familiar with the professional structure of the discipline. A large portion of the course will be devoted to the debate/discussion/exploration of ethical issues that challenge anthropologists through the use of real cases that have confronted researchers in the field, and through an evaluation of the ethical codes of conduct adopted by the primary professional organizations in anthropology.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/rachel-scott.html">5.0</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/rachel-scott.html">Rachel</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/rachel-scott.html">Scott</a></td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>21015</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
