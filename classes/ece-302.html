Strategies in developing positive and supportive relationships with families of young children with special needs, including family-centered practices, will be explored. Particular attention is given to the challenges faced by teachers and other professionals in early intervention in assessing children?s needs and providing services, which are reflective of the child?s development within his/her diverse cultural and community context.  In addition, the course examines ways to develop and maintain productive and collaborative relationships among professionals and families, communities, and other professionals across the range of support systems in the IFSP and IEP planning processes.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/alice-moss.html" style="text-decoration:none">3.73</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/alice-moss.html" style="text-decoration:none">Alice</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/alice-moss.html" style="text-decoration:none">Moss</a></td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>24379</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
