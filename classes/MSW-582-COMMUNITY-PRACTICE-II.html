The emphasis in this course, which represents the second of three consecutive, required (advanced) practice courses, is on program planning.  This course introduces students to the skills and knowledge needed to plan and design programs in community-based, people-serving organizations, starting with problem analysis and needs assessment.  Related topics such as understanding the multiple dimensions of social problems, operationalizing concerns, and the importance of collaboration and addressing diverse groups' needs within a community practice framework are also addressed.  Measures for accountability and effectiveness, especially for professional social workers, are also addressed.   Attention is also given to the needs of historically-marginalized groups and planning for full social and economic justice.
It is required that this course be taken concurrently with MSW 592 (Advanced Field Education II).<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Maria</td><td>Ferrera</td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20881</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/tracey-mabrey.html">4.88</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/tracey-mabrey.html">Tracey</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/tracey-mabrey.html">Mabrey</a></td><td>1:30 PM</td><td>4:40 PM</td><td>202</td><td>20882</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
