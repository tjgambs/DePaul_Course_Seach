Students will learn what jazz is, learn about its fascinating history and some of its most influential players, and learn about the special role that Chicago has played-and still does play-in great jazz. In the classroom we'll hear records, view videos, engage the instructor in question-and-answer sessions, and hear stories about this unique musical art form and Chicago's ongoing role in it. The instructor, a jazz writer and longtime jazz drummer, will enliven the course with personal anecdotes covering a considerable part of Chicago jazz history.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>2</td><td>Joseph</td><td>Cunniff</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>23903</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Joseph</td><td>Cunniff</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>802</td><td>23904</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Joseph</td><td>Cunniff</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>803</td><td>23905</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr>
