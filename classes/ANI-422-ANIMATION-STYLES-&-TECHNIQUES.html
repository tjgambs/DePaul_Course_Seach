Students will be involved in an intense study of animation throughout history and around the world, and are required to view a large amount of work outside of class.  Animations will be grouped by time period, theme, and/or technique. Through writing and group discussions they will examine the significance of the technique and subject matter.  They will put this study into practice by creating short animated films based on their reactions to the films.
