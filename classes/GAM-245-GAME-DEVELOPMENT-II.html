Emphasis will be placed on teamwork and development pipelines for the design and creation of assets and systems. Students will use a combination of prototyping, storyboarding, user stories, character breakdowns, system breakdowns and flowcharts in the design portion of the game. We will be using Gamemaker Studio as the engine to develop and implement the game. The goals of all design done in this course will focus around designing for the needs of a client; solving problems identified by the client; and providing transparency via reports and milestone deliverables.
