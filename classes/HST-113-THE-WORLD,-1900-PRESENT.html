The world at end of the century, in 2001, was nothing like the world that our great-great-grandparents were born into just 100 years before. And, unlike previous eras, what happened on one place impacted everyone everywhere on earth. Why and how did such vast changes occur, and why did they happen so quickly? These are some of the themes that History 113 will address.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Robert</td><td>Garfield</td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>201</td><td>21507</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Authens</td><td>Oppong Wadie</td><td>11:50 AM</td><td>1:20 PM</td><td>501</td><td>20475</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Jay</td><td>Nelson</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>20474</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr>
