Moral philosophers, such as Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant, all pose questions about the nature of right and wrong, and what is meant by a good life. The first part of the course examines the work of these philosophers and then uses them in order to think through specific topics, including: confidentiality, informed consent and end of life decision-making; health care disparities and health care reform; and global health ethics. Students who have taken REL 229 Medicine, Ethics, and Society, or PHL 229 Biomedical Ethics should not enroll in this course.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Craig</td><td>Klugman</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>21732</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
