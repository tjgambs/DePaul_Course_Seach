Students learn strategies for combining experience with analysis and reflection in writing, managing the writing process, working effectively with sources, and writing persuasively. Students also practice using writing as a tool for exploring as well as communicating their ideas. Particular emphasis will be given to the process of revision as they learn to write to demonstrate competence, develop their ideas, refine their writing, and give feedback to others. The course assumes a basic understanding of English grammar. Note that SNL does not accept transfer courses for the L4 competence; however, students who feel their writing is particularly strong and have examples of their writing should consider taking the L4 Proficiency Exam to satisfy the L4 Competence.  To ensure success in SNL?s writing intensive program, complete at least one core SNL writing course (LL 140 Writing Workshop or LL 260 Writing for Competence) or the L4 Writing Portfolio Proficiency Exam within your first three terms at SNL.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Michelle</td><td>Navarre Cleary</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>801</td><td>23859</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Joseph</td><td>Hemmerling</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>802</td><td>23860</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Thomas</td><td>Dow</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>803</td><td>23861</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Peter</td><td>Forster</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>804</td><td>23866</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>806</td><td>23940</td><td>Naperville Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Jane</td><td>Wagoner</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>807</td><td>26674</td><td>O'Hare Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Jane</td><td>Wagoner</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>807</td><td>26674</td><td>O'Hare Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Jane</td><td>Wagoner</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>807</td><td>26674</td><td>O'Hare Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Jane</td><td>Wagoner</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>807</td><td>26674</td><td>O'Hare Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Jane</td><td>Wagoner</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>807</td><td>26674</td><td>O'Hare Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Jane</td><td>Wagoner</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>807</td><td>26674</td><td>O'Hare Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
