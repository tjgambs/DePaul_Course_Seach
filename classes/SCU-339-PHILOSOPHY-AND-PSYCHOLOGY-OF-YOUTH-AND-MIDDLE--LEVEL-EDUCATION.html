It provides an investigation of how these theoretical ideas relate to contemporary questions of youth and middle level education.  The course explores the historical invention of adolescence, changing ideas about the meaning of childhood, as well as some of the broader social, economic, political, and cultural implications of these changing ideas.  This course seeks to develop in prospective educators a broader capacity to theorize about youth and schooling and, hence, to act critically and reflectively in multiple contexts in which youth learn. 10 - 15 field experience hours are required as part of this course.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>24490</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/horace-hall.html">4.8</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/horace-hall.html">Horace</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/horace-hall.html">Hall</a></td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>801</td><td>24491</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
