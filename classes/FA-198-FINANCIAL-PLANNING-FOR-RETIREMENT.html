We look carefully at the range of decisions facing adults in the U.S. as they plan for their post-working years.  Learning focuses on best models of collaborating with financial experts, and planning for balance in life expectancy and assets (including real estate). The culmination of our course lies in the question of whether to remain employed for life; to resist retirement.  We examine that possibility in the light of current labor market practices and the potential benefits of elder entrepreneurship.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Elmer</td><td>Lewis</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>801</td><td>23576</td><td>Naperville Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Elmer</td><td>Lewis</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>802</td><td>23577</td><td>Naperville Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Elmer</td><td>Lewis</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>803</td><td>23578</td><td>Naperville Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
