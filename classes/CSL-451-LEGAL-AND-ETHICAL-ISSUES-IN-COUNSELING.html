A core component of the course is a focus on how personal values intersect with ethical decision-making.  Ethical codes and ethical decision-making models related to the profession are studied so that the students will have the knowledge of professional ethical practice. An examination of local and federal laws in relation to the previously mentioned components will be examined. Students engage in case conceptualization, small group activities, role-playing with lectures, and video technology.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>201</td><td>24437</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
