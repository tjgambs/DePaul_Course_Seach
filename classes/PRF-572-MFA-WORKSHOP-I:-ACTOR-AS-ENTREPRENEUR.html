MFA Workshop also accommodates a number of projects generated by the MFA Acting students themselves.  As MFA Workshop is a process class, projects and workshops may or may not result in a showing.  (Some activities in the class will combine MFA I and MFA II students and some will be specific to each class.)<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/patrice-egleston.html">2.92</a></td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td><a href = "../teachers/patrice-egleston.html">Patrice</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/patrice-egleston.html">Egleston</a></td><td>3:10 PM</td><td>5:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>25309</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
