The theoretical and observational study of child development will be framed by an examination of culture, gender, and socio-economic factors as they inform assumptions about normative processes.  The relationship between development and learning in a social context will be examined with particular attention to children's developing concepts in math, science, and language arts.  Attention will also be given to the role of teachers and schools and other institutions in fostering the healthy development and learning of young people.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>An Chih</td><td>Cheng</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>201</td><td>24367</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr>
