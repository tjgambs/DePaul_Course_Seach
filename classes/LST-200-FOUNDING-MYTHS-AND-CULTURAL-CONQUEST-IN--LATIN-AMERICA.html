Colonialism, social stratification and forms of conflict and rebellion all played pivotal roles in the formation of Latin America from origins to the 18th century. The history and culture of the region is presented from many perspectives and across many disciplines.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/carolina-sternberg.html">4.5</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/carolina-sternberg.html">Carolina</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/carolina-sternberg.html">Sternberg</a></td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20535</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
