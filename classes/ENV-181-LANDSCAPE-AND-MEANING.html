Students will evaluate the formal character of particular landscapes and how this expression contributes to the overall experience of a place. The literary perspective of the course will focus on the rich tradition of associations between landscape design and social ideologies. Students will be asked to apply concepts from the literature to landscapes from their own personal experience to understand how meaning is both deeply personal and culturally derived. Students will extend this interpretation to creating their own landscape design for transforming an existing site in Chicago.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td></td><td>4</td><td>Monica</td><td>Richart</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>4:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>21693</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Friday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
