Students will learn the constitutional rights of all citizens regarding censorship, defamation, privacy, intellectual property, and commercial speech, and will study how technological developments are challenging the courts with how to apply the law to digital media. Those legal aspects are considered in relation to case studies that chronicle journalists' ethical responsibilities, including protecting sources, balancing professional duties and personal values, sharing and using social media content, and avoiding deceptive reporting practices.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Jason</td><td>Martin</td><td>10:10 AM</td><td>11:40 AM</td><td>502</td><td>23208</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr>
