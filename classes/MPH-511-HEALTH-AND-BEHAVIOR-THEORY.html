The theories and models will be explored from multidisciplinary perspectives and will be applied to an array of health issues.  Practical applications of these theories to the development and implementations of theory-based public health interventions that can be applied with multiple populations (e.g., women, adolescents, elderly, people of color) within multiple settings (e.g., communities, schools, health care settings) at various levels of change (e.g., individual, community, social, policy) will also be explored.
