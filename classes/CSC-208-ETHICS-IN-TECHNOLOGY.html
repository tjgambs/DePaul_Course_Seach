Changes have been swift and the human capacity to deal with them is limited.  It has been said that our technology has outpaced our humanity.  This course will research the new responsibilities technology presents and our ability to deal with these changes in an ethical manner.  Students will employ ethical frameworks, which integrate computer science and ethics, to develop the skills required to examine different sets of assumptions and question them.  Case studies will provide a historical perspective for analysis.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/santiago-cortez.html">4.8</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/santiago-cortez.html">Santiago</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/santiago-cortez.html">Cortez</a></td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>22324</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/santiago-cortez.html">4.8</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/santiago-cortez.html">Santiago</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/santiago-cortez.html">Cortez</a></td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>202</td><td>22325</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/santiago-cortez.html">4.8</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/santiago-cortez.html">Santiago</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/santiago-cortez.html">Cortez</a></td><td>10:10 AM</td><td>11:40 AM</td><td>501</td><td>26440</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/santiago-cortez.html">4.8</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/santiago-cortez.html">Santiago</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/santiago-cortez.html">Cortez</a></td><td>11:50 AM</td><td>1:20 PM</td><td>502</td><td>22326</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
