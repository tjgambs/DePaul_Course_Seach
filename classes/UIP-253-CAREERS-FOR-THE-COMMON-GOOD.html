Those organizations may be nonprofits (providing low-income housing, or supporting the arts, e.g.); community organizing groups; foundations, which typically provide funding; unions; and the local, state, and federal governments.  Students will familiarize themselves with career options and gain valuable networking opportunities.  This hybrid course will meet five times per quarter.  Students are required to work 100 hours during the quarter.  Attendance at an internship orientation is required. This course will provide an opportunity to students to familiarize themselves with career opportunities in the public service sector by focusing on (a) the types of problems that public service organizations attempt to address; (b) the different strategies used by different types of public service organizations; and (c) the range of available public service jobs.  The course will promote the life-long process of integrating work and learning, enable students to view their internship within a broad perspective, assist career decision-making, promote individual success through on-the-job experience, and provide students with valuable networking opportunities, all with a focus on public service careers. Attendance at an internship orientation meeting is required prior to the start of the course. All of our 4-credit UIP courses fulfill the JYEL learning requirement. If you have completed the requirement already, the course will be counted as a general elective course.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-murray.html">4.8</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>20971</td><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-murray.html">Mark</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-murray.html">Murray</a></td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>20971</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-murray.html">4.8</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>20971</td><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-murray.html">Mark</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-murray.html">Murray</a></td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>20971</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
