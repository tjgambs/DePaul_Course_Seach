Students will evaluate the tendencies and correlations between what a person "thinks" and what that person "does" through observation and interpretation of their own experiences.  A report will be generated that will include an analysis of the student's own cognitive behavioral tendencies and a plan for personal development.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/kenneth-skorupa.html">4.42</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/kenneth-skorupa.html">Kenneth</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/kenneth-skorupa.html">Skorupa</a></td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>801</td><td>26249</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
