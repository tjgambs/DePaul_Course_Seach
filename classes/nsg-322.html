The nursing role in facilitating safe and effective pharmacotherapy is emphasized. The registered nurse plays a vital role in the education and treatment of patients undergoing drug therapy. To function successfully in this role, the nurse must understand the relationship between: a) pathophysiologic mechanisms and manifestations of disease, b) the fundamental principles of drug action, c) the application of specific drugs in the treatment of disease, and d) related nursing care considerations. The course recognizes the importance of patient teaching as a nursing function and provides greater emphasis on this topic. Guidelines for and specific examples of patient teaching are covered in each session. Changes in structure and function as a result of normal development and aging are addressed. Fundamentals of drug administration and calculations related to pharmacotherapy in a way that ensures the patient's safety and satisfies medical and legal concerns are being reviewed.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Jennifer</td><td>Jackson</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>5:15 PM</td><td>201</td><td>25799</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Jennifer</td><td>Jackson</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>5:15 PM</td><td>202</td><td>25800</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/larry-maturin.html">4.8</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/larry-maturin.html">Larry</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/larry-maturin.html">Maturin</a></td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>5:15 PM</td><td>203</td><td>25867</td><td>Rosalind Franklin University</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
