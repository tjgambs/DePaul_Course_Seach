Focus on the differences between speech and writing with an emphasis on the latter as expressed in compositions, editing, translation, and other writing activities. This course is designed to help students develop culturally appropriate speech, writing, and translation through the study of speech acts and written documents within the context of a systematic study and review of grammar. The course introduces sophisticated syntactical patterns of the language and increases students' vocabulary, thus enabling them to write more elaborate compositions and improve their oral communication skills in a culturally appropriate manner. All students become editors of DePaul's literary French magazine, Mille-Feuille, and participate in all stages of its publication. The overarching theme of the course is the geography of France. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of France's geography, and be introduced to some of the regional characteristics of its literature and culture, economy, cuisine, music, and handicraft. FCH 106 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20462</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td></tr><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Pascale-Anne</td><td>Brault</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>202</td><td>20463</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
