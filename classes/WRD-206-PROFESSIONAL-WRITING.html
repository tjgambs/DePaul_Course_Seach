The course provides a solid foundation that students can build on as they develop specializations in their professional fields.  Through a series of short assignments, students explore the structure and format of typical professional writing documents, examine a variety of workplace writing situations, and begin developing a clear and concise style appropriate for professional settings. Students analyze and write a number of workplace genres, such as memos, emails, letters, resumes, short reports, web documents, and professional presentations.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/lisa-dush.html">4.0</a></td><td>Closed</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/lisa-dush.html">Lisa</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/lisa-dush.html">Dush</a></td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20729</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/alan-ackmann.html">3.0</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/alan-ackmann.html">Alan</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/alan-ackmann.html">Ackmann</a></td><td>11:50 AM</td><td>1:20 PM</td><td>501</td><td>26413</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
