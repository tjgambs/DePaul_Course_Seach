The goal is to achieve a high level of musicianship through repertoire selected by the instructor and rehearsal/performance preparation demonstrated by the individual members of the ensemble.  While setting a high performance expectation, a productive and meaningful music-making environment will also be fostered. All of the MEN courses are repeatable courses. Placement audition required.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/erica-neidlinger.html">4.0</a></td><td>Open</td><td>1</td><td><a href = "../teachers/erica-neidlinger.html">Erica</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/erica-neidlinger.html">Neidlinger</a></td><td>3:30 PM</td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>21939</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday,Friday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
