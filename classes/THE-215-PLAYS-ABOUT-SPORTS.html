A significant component in this relationship is the concept of performance and what that entails.  We speak of high-performance cars and trucks, we applaud and then discuss, blog, and tweet (sometimes to an extraordinary degree) the performances of both athletes and actors, we talk about academic performance, we see performing seals, dolphins, and whales at Shedd Aquarium, a member of the clergy performs a wedding ceremony, and the list continues.  A highly contested term, performance is bound to the team role as it relates to sports, theatre, and everyday life. What is your role on the team?  What role were you cast in?  What is your role in the company?  The team role is aligned with function and also with the context in which the "role is played."
More than anything perhaps, both sports and theatre deal with highly charged relationships.  In the plays that we will examine in the course, it is the sport itself that serves as both the context of and trigger for the relationships that are created, strengthened, weakened, or in the worst-case scenarios, totally shattered.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Louis</td><td>Contey</td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>201</td><td>25426</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
