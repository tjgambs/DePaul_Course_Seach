Journalism's social responsibilities and its functioning as a business are examined across major periods of American history-the colonial and revolutionary press, the early Republican and penny press, the Civil War press and the press of industrializing America, the rise of the tabloid press, and the role of the press in reporting the development of the United States as a world power during World War II and in its aftermath-will be captured.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/bruce-evensen.html">3.6</a></td><td>Closed</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/bruce-evensen.html">Bruce</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/bruce-evensen.html">Evensen</a></td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>501</td><td>23203</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/bruce-evensen.html">3.6</a></td><td>Closed</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/bruce-evensen.html">Bruce</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/bruce-evensen.html">Evensen</a></td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>501</td><td>23203</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
