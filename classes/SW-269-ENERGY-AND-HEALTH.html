We will consider connections between social and environmental variables such as constitution, stress, lifestyle, and vital physiological functions.  Each class will build on the basic understanding of biological systems in relation to energy through lecture and discussion.  We will review literature on various healthcare practices to discern sound approaches and practical applications.  Students will cultivate an appreciation for daily health choices that cumulatively affect their health.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Gina</td><td>Orlando</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>23930</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Gina</td><td>Orlando</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>802</td><td>23931</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Gina</td><td>Orlando</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>803</td><td>23932</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Gina</td><td>Orlando</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>804</td><td>23933</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
