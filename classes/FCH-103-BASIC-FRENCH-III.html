Completion of the basic elements of the French language, spoken as well as written, with due regard to the cultural context of French expression. This course completes the introduction to the study of the French language and the culture of Francophone countries. Its methodology is based on two assumptions. The first assumption is that language and culture are inseparable. As students learn the French language, they will also gain insights about the French and Francophone people and their culture. The second assumption is that language is for communication. Studying a foreign language does not mean memorizing grammar rules, but internalizing these rules so that learners can use them as guidelines when they attempt to express themselves in spoken and written French. The course also centers on the explanation of cultural aspects of French life, especially as they differ from American life. In-class work is devoted to intensive communication practice, so that students are able to put the rules they study to use in talking about themselves and their personal interests in French.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/jessica-martino.html">3.5</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/jessica-martino.html">Jessica</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/jessica-martino.html">Martino</a></td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>21030</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
