We discuss the fundraising tradition in the U.S., principal donor types, theories of donor behavior, and the organizational, legal and ethical contexts of fundraising. Students learn basic fundraising tools, including planning, grant writing, special events, major gifts, planned giving, and capital campaigns. Students work as volunteer consultants with nonprofit partners to analyze their current fundraising strategies and materials and help them develop new ones.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20847</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
