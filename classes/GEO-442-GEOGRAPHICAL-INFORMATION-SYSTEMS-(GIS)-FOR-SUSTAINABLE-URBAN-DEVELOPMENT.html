Students will learn geospatial techniques in support of sustainable practices, including promoting energy efficiency, managing water resources, promoting sustainable options of transportation, improving access to local healthy foods, and responding to climate change. This is accomplished through hands-on lab activities and a case study conducted in collaboration with a non-profit organization engaged in promotion of sustainable practices in Chicago.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/sungsoon-hwang.html"></a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/sungsoon-hwang.html">Sungsoon</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/sungsoon-hwang.html">Hwang</a></td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>201</td><td>21421</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
