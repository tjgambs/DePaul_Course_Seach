Initial discussions will focus on understanding biostatistics and epidemiological statistics as applied to health and disease in diverse populations. From considering the relationship between measurement and biostatistics to understanding the importance of insuring data integrity throughout the research process, students will examine existing data sets (federal, voluntary agencies, professional/specialty organizations). Then the focus will be on understanding epidemiological statistics (rates, proportions, relative and absolute risk), descriptive statistics, measures of differences, measures of relationships/prediction, and multivariate statistical models as applied to health and disease.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>4</td><td>Young-Me</td><td>Lee</td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>201</td><td>25850</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
