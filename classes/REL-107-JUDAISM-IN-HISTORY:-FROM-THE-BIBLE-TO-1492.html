It seeks to provide students an entree into the world of Jewish religious and historical experience and to help them develop a conceptual understanding of the thought and practice that underlies the Jewish worldview. It also seeks to examine certain continuities and discontinuities in the conception of Judaism as reflected in selected texts which express the full range of Jewish religious and national creativity. Among the topics to be discussed are the complex relations of Jewish thinkers to the surrounding non-Jewish cultures, and how these interactions affected the Jews' understanding of Judaism. The approach to this material will be intellectual-historical. The course is designed as the first part of a two-course sequence on the history of Judaism from the Bible to the present. It focuses on the history of Jewish tradition from the earliest references to Ancient Israel circa 1200 BCE to the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/alexi-sivertsev.html">3.5</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/alexi-sivertsev.html">Alexi</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/alexi-sivertsev.html">Sivertsev</a></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>801</td><td>20900</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
