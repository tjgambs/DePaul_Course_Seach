The primary approach to this material will be from the perspective of the artmaker (artist or designer), for whom art theory, criticism and history are crucial tools for developing effective and meaningful work.  For that reason, this class will be taught by studio faculty.  The class will make extensive use of the city's contemporary museums, galleries, exhibitions and works of public art to emphasize the social, economic and political context from which works of art and design emerge as indicators or signposts of contemporary cultural concerns.  Students cannot receive credit for both ART 200 and ART 222.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Laura</td><td>Kina Aronson</td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20402</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/matthew-girson.html">4.3</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/matthew-girson.html">Matthew</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/matthew-girson.html">Girson</a></td><td>4:20 PM</td><td>5:50 PM</td><td>202</td><td>26017</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
