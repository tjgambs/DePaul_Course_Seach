Works of art are examined both in relation to American social and cultural history and also as aesthetic objects. The overarching themes of the class include the "American-ness" of American art, the relationship between American and European art, the function and production of art, and the expanding definition of American expression through multicultural diversity.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-pohlad.html">4.7</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-pohlad.html">Mark</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-pohlad.html">Pohlad</a></td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26097</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
