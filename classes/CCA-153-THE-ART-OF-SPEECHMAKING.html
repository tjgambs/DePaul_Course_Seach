The criteria for success is established through an examination of and critique of the content goals.

Speech, whether we call it dramatic or declamatory, has the potential to move the masses. In this course, our students will discover their personal approaches and attributes, and construct effective presentations that harness the power of their voice and body.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>2</td><td>Carol</td><td>Blanchard-Rocheleau</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>801</td><td>26235</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Carol</td><td>Blanchard-Rocheleau</td><td></td><td></td><td>802</td><td>26236</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr></table></body></html>
