A primary goal of the course is to help students become knowledgeable of the ever-increasing development of the field across the world and the opportunities it offers to them, especially in government, transnational businesses, non-governmental organizations, and global agencies. Using a combination of real-world cases, interaction with industry professionals, on-site visit(s), and engagement with the multicultural aspects of the city of Chicago, students will put the class content in perspective and acquire competencies to be effective communicators and global public relations managers.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/rajul-jain.html">3.7</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/rajul-jain.html">Rajul</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/rajul-jain.html">Jain</a></td><td></td><td></td><td>501</td><td>23310</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
