In the context of this course, both of these phenomena are associated with 250 years of U.S. chattel slavery, followed by decades of de jure and de facto racial discrimination. It is a subject that has historical, psychological and sociological implications and thus is a must for students pursuing undergraduate and/or graduate work in these areas. With this primary goal in mind, students will be asked to review one of two texts on the subject, Joy DeGruy-Leary's Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome: America's Legacy of Enduring Inquiry and Healing or Thom Burrell's Brainwashed: Challenging the Myth of Black Inferiority, along with selected readings where appropriate.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>2</td><td>Nancy</td><td>Davis</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>801</td><td>23425</td><td>Off Campus</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Nancy</td><td>Davis</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>802</td><td>23426</td><td>Off Campus</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Nancy</td><td>Davis</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>803</td><td>23427</td><td>Off Campus</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Nancy</td><td>Davis</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>804</td><td>23428</td><td>Off Campus</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Nancy</td><td>Davis</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>805</td><td>23429</td><td>Off Campus</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Nancy</td><td>Davis</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>806</td><td>23430</td><td>Off Campus</td><td></td> </tr>
