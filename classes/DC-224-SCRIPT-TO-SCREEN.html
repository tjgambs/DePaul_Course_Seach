Students will read feature length scripts of varying genres and then perform a critical analysis and comparison of the text to the final produced versions of the films. Storytelling conventions such as structure, character development, theme, and the creation of tension will be used to uncover alterations and how these adjustments ultimately impacted the film's reception.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>James</td><td>Choi</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>4:45 PM</td><td>502</td><td>22902</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday,Friday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>James</td><td>Choi</td><td></td><td></td><td>511</td><td>22903</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr></table></body></html>
