A further focus is on how this transformation of national boundaries depends not only upon political changes but also upon economic and cultural shifts. This transnational perspective pays attention to the inequalities and differences intersecting race, class, and gender that arise from new forms of globalization as well as from older histories of colonialism and racism. The course is designed to give the student an in-depth look at a world of connections that do not necessarily create similarities in how women variously experience that world. It introduces students to research by and about women that reflects transnationality in all of its possibilities and challenges.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/laila-farah.html">3.5</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/laila-farah.html">Laila</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/laila-farah.html">Farah</a></td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20721</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
