The course provides a forum for directors to discuss current rehearsal processes and trouble-shoot with their colleagues and instructor.  Additionally, directing students reflect on, discuss and receive feedback from their colleagues and instructor on production work.  The second half of the course focuses on honing a specific directorial skill or exploring new directorial territory.  This component changes quarterly at the discretion of the instructor.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>3</td><td>Damon</td><td>Kiely</td><td>9:00 AM</td><td>11:30 AM</td><td>201</td><td>25370</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
