These courses connect the student's Animation coursework with their overall Liberal Studies coursework through three components: class lectures and discussions, independent analysis and reflection, and the creation of a significant animation project.  Students will employ the knowledge they have learned and the skills they have acquired in all their Animation courses to date to produce a significant animation project.  The course sequence is designed to be taken in two consecutive quarters.
