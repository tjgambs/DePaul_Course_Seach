The course begins by examining the construction of race in eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth-century European and American philosophy and body politic and with an examination of art, art history, film, and literature.  Section two explores the definition of love; it examines Christian definitions of love as well as secular definitions from black intellectuals, cultural critics, and scholars.  Section three examines a range of genres in search of progressive, transformative, positive images that depict blacks in loving relationships, rediscovering what it means to love oneself and others in spite of/because of our human differences (in race/ethnicity, gender, class, sexuality).<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Julie</td><td>Moody-Freeman</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>25980</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr>
