Through project-based experimentation, students deepen their critical engagement with photographic tools while producing conceptually driven bodies of work. Refined use of the DSLR camera and editing tools takes place through hands-on image production and process-oriented critique. Additionally, this course explores historically established uses of the photographic medium and their relation in the digital context.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/chi-jang-yin.html">4.1</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/chi-jang-yin.html">Chi Jang</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/chi-jang-yin.html">Yin</a></td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>2:05 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20734</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
