These figures intersect with various critical discourses on gender, sexuality, nationalism, exoticism, orientalism, modernity, tradition, art, and aesthetics. They have also generated both praise and criticism. These questions are not only specific to the cultural figures as listed above but also run deep in society. The course will also examine other historical and ideological constructions in Japan and the West, especially in the United States.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26195</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
