These topics will be addressed within different historical and social contexts.  Readings will include primary texts by major theorists as well as secondary material including commentary and critique.  A primary goal of the course is to provide students with an overview of major movements in curriculum history as a foundation for further study.  This course will serve as a prerequisite for all other curriculum courses in the doctoral program.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Jeffrey</td><td>Kuzmic</td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>201</td><td>24411</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>202</td><td>24627</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr>
