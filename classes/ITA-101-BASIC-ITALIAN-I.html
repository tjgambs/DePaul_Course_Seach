Focus is on the development of reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills and the study of Italian culture through language. Class activity will consist mainly of interactive oral exercises based on material in the textbook, online, and from other sources. The course aims to provide students with basic functional skills in Italian. Italian 101 focuses on introducing and talking about oneself (interests, occupation, leisure activities, likes, dislikes), ordering in a cafe and restaurant, addressing others formally or informally, and everyday life. By the end of the beginning Italian sequence, students should be able to engage in basic conversation on a variety of topics, write simple paragraphs, and read passages in contemporary Italian.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/lucia-marchi.html">4.3</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/lucia-marchi.html">Lucia</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/lucia-marchi.html">Marchi</a></td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>21448</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
