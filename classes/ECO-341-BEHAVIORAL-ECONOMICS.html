This course will examine the findings from the psychology literature that inform the issue of decision making, explore how these findings have challenged standard economic models, and examine how the findings are being incorporated into economic thinking about choice. In addition to an introduction to the Behavioral Economics literature, students will have the opportunity to develop a project of their own using behavioral economics to examine a current economic issue.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/laura-owen.html">3.8</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/laura-owen.html">Laura</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/laura-owen.html">Owen</a></td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>501</td><td>26869</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
