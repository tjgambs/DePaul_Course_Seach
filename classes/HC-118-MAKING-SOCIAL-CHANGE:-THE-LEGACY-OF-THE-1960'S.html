They participated in public meetings, belonged to labor unions, joined churches, and formed professional societies. These civic structures and habits of involvement empowered citizens to believe they could make a difference in their communities and laid the groundwork for some of the major social movements of the second half of the 20th Century. Civil rights, second-wave feminism, gay rights, and Latino rights all have their roots in the 1960s and continued their work over the following decades.  In this class, we will explore civic engagement through the lens of our recent history. We will look at how these movements developed and analyze how they achieved their goals. We will take lessons from our predecessors and apply them to our own efforts to make a contribution to the lives of people in our local, national or global communities.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Erin</td><td>Kasprzak</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>801</td><td>24039</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Erin</td><td>Kasprzak</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>802</td><td>24040</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Christine</td><td>Fojtik</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>803</td><td>24187</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Christine</td><td>Fojtik</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>804</td><td>24188</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
