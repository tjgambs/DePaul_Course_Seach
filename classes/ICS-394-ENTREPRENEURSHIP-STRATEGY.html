General business management problems integrating marketing, accounting, finance and management functions are analyzed from the perspective of the CEO or entrepreneur concerned with start-up and planning of a new venture. The case method is used in this course and real "live" cases may be analyzed.  The entrepreneurial process is investigated, including entrepreneurial  characteristics, trends in the small business sector of the global economy, start-up and growth strategies and nurturing creativity in organizations. Focus is placed on either a consulting project with a small business or community organization, which may require time outside of class for the project, or on case studies.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Javier</td><td>Monllor</td><td>9:00 AM</td><td>4:00 PM</td><td>501</td><td>24699</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Raman</td><td>Chadha</td><td>3:10 PM</td><td>4:40 PM</td><td>502</td><td>24704</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Edward</td><td>Papabathini</td><td>11:50 AM</td><td>1:20 PM</td><td>503</td><td>24705</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>April</td><td>Lane</td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>801</td><td>24706</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>802</td><td>24707</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
