The focus is on the director's relationship to text through the analysis of playscripts and the use of that analysis to plan an interpretation of a play.  Analysis will come from a variety of perspectives--personal, psychological, social, and historical.  In addition to preparing and presenting their projects, students will attend performances and write papers in response.  The class combines lecture, discussion, group exercises, and in-class activities.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Azar</td><td>Kazemi</td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>25240</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
