This class will explore adolescent development, considering the ways in which economic, social, political and cultural contexts influence that development.  In addition, we will focus on adolescent relationships, group work with teens, aggression and violence in intimate -- in particular teen -- relationships, and evaluation of programs to prevent teen violence.  Each week students will address a set of theoretical and/or practical themes that in some way relate to teen violence and aggression, as well as prevention of such violence.  Discussions of each theme will draw on course readings, lecture materials, and perhaps most importantly, students' experiences working with teens in schools.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/beth-catlett.html">4.65</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/beth-catlett.html">Beth</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/beth-catlett.html">Catlett</a></td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>801</td><td>21115</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
