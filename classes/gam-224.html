Students will study the principles of game design and use them both to analyze existing games and to develop their own original game ideas. Students will also learn about the process of game development, starting from the game's narrative concept and moving to consideration of a game's components: the representation of the player, of artifacts, the virtual world that contains them and the interaction between them and the player.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Jonathan</td><td>Hey</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>22412</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td></tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/johnny-wilson.html" style="text-decoration:none">2.4</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/johnny-wilson.html" style="text-decoration:none">Johnny</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/johnny-wilson.html" style="text-decoration:none">Wilson</a></td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>22413</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
