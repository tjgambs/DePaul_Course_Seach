Did you update your Facebook status? Send off a text or tweet? If you did, someone was watching. Every day in our mundane activities we leave trails of information that are gathered up by private data brokers, advertisers, police officers and intelligence professionals. This data has increasingly come to reshape our lives, the way we sustain ourselves (i.e. work) and the way we enjoy our "off-time." The course locates our digitally mediated lives in a larger global division of digital labor that extends from the mining conflict minerals to sweatshop conditions in Chinese factories to the seemingly glamorous world of Google's software engineers. It considers the historic evolution of the advertising industry and the way information technology has reshaped housework. The course closes with a critical assessment of global labor and various proposals to ensure decent life for the workers of the world. In all, we explore the lives of our digital dopplegangers, asses the struggles of digital workers, and try to find needed perspective on surveillance in the contemporary world.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/brendan-mcquade.html" style="text-decoration:none">3.7</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/brendan-mcquade.html" style="text-decoration:none">Brendan</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/brendan-mcquade.html" style="text-decoration:none">McQuade</a></td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26134</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
