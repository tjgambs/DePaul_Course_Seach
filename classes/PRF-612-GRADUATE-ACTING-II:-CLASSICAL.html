Though prose lacks meter, it has its own rhythm, in part defined by punctuation and rhetorical shape. Finding that rhythm of thought is essential to the clarity and life of the prose. With prose, as with meter, rhetoric, and imagery, we approach the work through both brain and body: balancing analytical and physical techniques for understanding and harnessing the dynamics of Shakespeare's language.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>5</td><td>Cameron</td><td>Knight</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>3:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>25313</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
