This core course explores the politics of the urban political machines that dominated politics in many cities for a long time, though some might argue that thay actually had few policy interests other than to remain in power. The course examines how power is distributed in cities, and how it is used to get at the various problems confronting cities. That is, how politics affects policy. The course studies the players in the game of policy formation, and the policy process itself. While the focus may be on cities, make no mistake, politics impacts environmental policy decisions and the process of making those decisions as well.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/william-sampson.html" style="text-decoration:none">2.65</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/william-sampson.html" style="text-decoration:none">William</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/william-sampson.html" style="text-decoration:none">Sampson</a></td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>21312</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
