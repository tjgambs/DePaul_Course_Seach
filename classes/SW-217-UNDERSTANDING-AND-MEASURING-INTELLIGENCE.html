Students learn the principles of assessing human traits (reliability, validity, bias and other systematic errors), and apply them to intelligence testing. We will work to define "intelligence" and consider various approaches to intelligence, contrasting the theories of unitary vs. multiple intelligences. Students will examine the implications of the definitions and measurement approaches on different groups of people, both historically and currently, with attention to the unintended effects of the biases of test developers and the ethical implications of different approaches and uses of intelligence testing.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>2</td><td>Deborah</td><td>Snyder</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>801</td><td>23847</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Deborah</td><td>Snyder</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>802</td><td>23848</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Deborah</td><td>Snyder</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>803</td><td>23849</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Deborah</td><td>Snyder</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>804</td><td>23850</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr></table></body></html>
