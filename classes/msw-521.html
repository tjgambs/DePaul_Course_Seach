This course is taken either concurrently with MSW 582 (Community Practice II) or before advanced field education. MSW 521 emphasizes budget preparation, fund acquisition and fund distribution. Successful completion of MSW 501 (Program Evaluation) is required for this course, as is the successful completion of the MSW research course (MSW 421). This course builds upon the constructs introduced in the advanced practice sequence. This course introduces students to budgetary operations and the ethical, value-based planning and decision making processes by which social workers must implement fiscal and administrative decisions.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/tracey-mabrey.html" style="text-decoration:none">4.88</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/tracey-mabrey.html" style="text-decoration:none">Tracey</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/tracey-mabrey.html" style="text-decoration:none">Mabrey</a></td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20880</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
