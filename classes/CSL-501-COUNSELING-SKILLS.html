Skills emphasized in the course include: active listening, attending, rapport building, empathy, paraphrasing, confrontation, reflection, and goal setting. These skills enable students to establish a helping relationship with a client, facilitate the client's self-exploration and engagement in counseling, and encourage the client's active progression towards achieving specified counseling goals. Students practice basic counseling skills and participate in in-vivo role-play through laboratory exercises in the Education and Counseling Center (ECC). The instructor gives feedback on skill development to students during face-to-face consultation and through the viewing of videotaped sessions.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>201</td><td>24447</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Darrick</td><td>Tovar-Murray</td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>202</td><td>24448</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>203</td><td>24449</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
