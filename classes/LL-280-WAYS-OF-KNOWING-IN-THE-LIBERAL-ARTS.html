Many have come to know them as spirituals, sorrow songs created and first sung by African Americans that remind us of an over two centuries old period in our history when American slavery was legal and people of African descent were enslaved with purpose for profit. But these songs were also signals to freedom, carefully created and strategically communicated, as enslaved laborers risked their lives enroute on the Underground Railroad so that they could live in freedom. This course will draw from Chicago area resources to explore multiple ways of knowing about the African American experience through this moment in time. In addition to our engagement with texts from multiple sources within the liberal arts, discussions, writing, and presentations, field trips and other participatory learning activities may also illuminate the topic and enhance our learning about this American experience.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Deborah</td><td>Holton</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>26498</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Deborah</td><td>Holton</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>802</td><td>26499</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Deborah</td><td>Holton</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>803</td><td>26500</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
