Health disparities based on social and cultural difference are linked to major diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension and stroke, as well as access to and outcomes of health services. Class discussions will focus on the past, current and future health policy needs of multicultural and multifaceted societies. The phenomena of cultural, ethnic, gender, class, and sexual variation in complex societies; notions of diversity and social justice; understandings of cultural conflicts and how cultural differences are managed in healthcare settings will be considered. Students will integrate concepts of all levels of prevention in health care, examine research in health ethics and health policy and discuss legislative processes for their potential to improve the health of the public.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Paula</td><td>Kagan</td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>5:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>25851</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Michelle</td><td>Neuman</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>202</td><td>25852</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Michelle</td><td>Neuman</td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>5:50 PM</td><td>203</td><td>25853</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Paula</td><td>Kagan</td><td></td><td></td><td>204</td><td>25907</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Kashica</td><td>Webber-Ritchey</td><td></td><td></td><td>205</td><td>25908</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Rosetta</td><td>Speights</td><td>4:45 PM</td><td>7:55 PM</td><td>206</td><td>26816</td><td>Rosalind Franklin University</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
