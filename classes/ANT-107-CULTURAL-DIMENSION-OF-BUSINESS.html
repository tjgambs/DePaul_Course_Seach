We do not have to juxtapose buyers and sellers from the ends of the earth to see the implications of this question. Even within our own society there are cultural boundaries between buyers and sellers that we can observe. Through the readings and discussions, this course will explore these grey areas of business in cross-cultural environments.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>10:10 AM</td><td>11:40 AM</td><td>501</td><td>25990</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
