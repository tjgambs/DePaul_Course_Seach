The ways that racism has divided women's movements and feminist organizations will be examined along with the work of feminist scholars, writers, activists, and advocates who have articulated explicitly anti-racist theories, analyses, and programs within the U.S. as well as internationally.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/ann-russo.html">4.8</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/ann-russo.html">Ann</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/ann-russo.html">Russo</a></td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20938</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
