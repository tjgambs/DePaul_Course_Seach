Scientists now agree that the major cause of climate shift is man-made, specifically our use and abuse of global energy resources.  In Everyday Ecology we will analyze our energy use patterns and explore practical alternatives.  The word "ecology" originates from the meshing of two Greek words meaning the "study of homes."  Although the main focus of this course is the individual household, another ?household? we must take into account is the economy. Ecological economics examines how both disciplines need to look toward the other to be viable long term. We will examine options to bring the earth household (ecology) and the human household (economy) together for the benefit of both. This course observes how ?man? is connected to the world around him. It allows us to see our options in response to growing concern over global climate change. Through readings, field trips, activities, discussions and an analysis of our personal use of energy, this course enables  us to become increasingly aware of ecological issues. You will learn to evaluate the effect of personal choices on the earth and be introduced to alternative, ?greener? options.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Barbara</td><td>Ridd</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>801</td><td>24020</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Barbara</td><td>Ridd</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>802</td><td>24021</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Barbara</td><td>Ridd</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>803</td><td>24022</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Barbara</td><td>Ridd</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>804</td><td>24023</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
