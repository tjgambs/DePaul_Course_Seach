Students will explore the formation of the discipline up to the current day, focusing on the shifting understanding of ways of reading, writing and thinking about language. They will strive to answer the questions: "What does it mean to be a student of language and literature?" and, "What are the ways of knowing characteristic of English and Writing, Rhetoric, & Discourse majors?" In doing so, students will relate the disciplinary content of their major to their daily lives and interests and to the larger framework of human endeavor and understanding, including identifying its importance to the personal lives of high school students. The course is a prerequisite for TCH 421.   Offered during Winter term only.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/julie-bokser.html">3.35</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/julie-bokser.html">Julie</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/julie-bokser.html">Bokser</a></td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>21121</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
