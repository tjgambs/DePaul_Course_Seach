Students will gain an understanding of the body's stress response mechanisms and how this response when not checked can lead to consequences that diminish the quality of life.  Students will learn techniques for activating the body's relaxation response mechanisms.  We will explore the theoretical and  practical application of relaxation techniques such as controlled breathing, meditation, self-massage, biofeedback, Yoga, Tai Chi and other alternative health practices.  The importance of nutrition as a means of combating stress will also be covered.  Through experiencing the physiological response of the body to stress reduction techniques, students will gain the ability to assess and manage their own stress.  Other skills students will be able to acquire include: recognizing stress symptoms in self and others, how to choose a stress reduction method, understanding the relationship between stress and wellness, and devising stress reduction regimes for others.  Journaling, a short paper, selected readings and demonstration of advanced Yoga and Tai Chi techniques by a guest speaker will enhance the learning experience.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/elvrid-lawrence.html">3.75</a></td><td>2</td><td><a href = "../teachers/elvrid-lawrence.html">Elvrid</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/elvrid-lawrence.html">Lawrence</a></td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>26538</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/elvrid-lawrence.html">3.75</a></td><td>2</td><td><a href = "../teachers/elvrid-lawrence.html">Elvrid</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/elvrid-lawrence.html">Lawrence</a></td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>802</td><td>26539</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/elvrid-lawrence.html">3.75</a></td><td>2</td><td><a href = "../teachers/elvrid-lawrence.html">Elvrid</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/elvrid-lawrence.html">Lawrence</a></td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>803</td><td>26540</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
