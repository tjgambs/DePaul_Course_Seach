This interdisciplinary course asks how Latin America has been forged through local and global struggles for economic sovereignty, political self-determination, social and cultural identities in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. Students will be introduced to the histories of economic dependence after the dawn of political independence, the intertwined dynamics of U.S. interventionism and Latin American resistance, the making of indigenous movements, as well as the interrelated issues of gender, race, and sexuality.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20536</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
