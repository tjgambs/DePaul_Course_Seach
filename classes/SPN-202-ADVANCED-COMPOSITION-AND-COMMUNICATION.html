Students will focus a little more, however, on written expression. Readings for the class will serve as models for various types of writing (primarily exposition and argumentation), and students will analyze the structure of these models as well as discuss their content. The course will also place emphasis on the effective use of the dictionary and on mechanics (such as spelling and punctuation). SPN 106 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Lisbeth</td><td>Swain</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20714</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Diana</td><td>Puentes</td><td>4:20 PM</td><td>5:50 PM</td><td>202</td><td>20715</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Maria</td><td>Masud</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>203</td><td>20716</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Alejandra</td><td>Viti</td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>204</td><td>26343</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
