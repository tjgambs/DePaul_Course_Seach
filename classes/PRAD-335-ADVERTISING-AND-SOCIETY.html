Students read widely from a body of social criticism that may diminish democracy and endanger our collective public life. This course asks future practitioners to confront the uses and abuses of public relations and advertising, and to understand the negative social consequences that can result.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Dorothy</td><td>DeCarlo</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>23269</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
