Students will also focus on four major grammar points that typically cause difficulty for students of Spanish as a foreign language: the distinction between ser and estar, verb tense, verb aspect (preterite/imperfect), and verb mood (indicative/subjunctive). SPN 106 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/glen-carman.html">3.3</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/glen-carman.html">Glen</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/glen-carman.html">Carman</a></td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>20713</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
