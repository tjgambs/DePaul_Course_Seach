Ethical decisions in the workplace can have tremendous influence on the individuals and the corporations involved. The outcomes of unethical behavior can affect reputations, trust and career path. Results have been as severe as loss of employment, physical harm to individuals, corporate bankruptcy and even impacts to the economy. Students are placed in decision-making roles through exercises, case studies and role-playing. Reasoning skills are honed through identification of ethical issues and alternative means to analyze these issues. Ethical behavior is evaluated using analytical skills to apply ethical concepts to business situations.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Halina</td><td>Cowin</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>801</td><td>23804</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Halina</td><td>Cowin</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>802</td><td>23805</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Halina</td><td>Cowin</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>803</td><td>23806</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
