The course is an excellent way to examine your career path, build your portfolio, and enhance your network.  Course meetings will take place during the 2nd and 5th weeks of the quarter. The internship experience must be a minimum of ten hours/week for the full ten weeks of the quarter.  The Marketing Internship office can work with you to help you find a placement, or, you can secure an internship on your own and apply to enroll in the course during the quarter in which you are interning. The position must be approved by the Internship Coordinator and enrolling in MKT 393 requires the approval of the faculty member. IME Marketing majors are required to complete one quarter of internship credit or the equivalent. International students may use MKT 393 for CPT credit.  The work MUST be done during the time that the student is receiving credit.  MKT 393 fulfills the Junior Year Experiential Learning requirement.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>J.</td><td>Kelly</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>501</td><td>24733</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
