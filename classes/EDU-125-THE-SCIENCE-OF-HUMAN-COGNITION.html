We will read, think, and talk about these practices from a variety of social and cultural contexts. We will consider the application and value of cognitive neuroscience to the future of this field of study. We will also venture into how, over time, research into human cognition and how people learn has impacted schooling, teaching practices, and political agendas.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/mindy-kalchman.html">3.73</a></td><td>Closed</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/mindy-kalchman.html">Mindy</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/mindy-kalchman.html">Kalchman</a></td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26448</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
