Working in teams, students will approach a communication problem for a real-world client just as an advertising agency would when working on new business. Students will bring together knowledge from past courses as they gather and analyze primary and secondary data to assess the client's situation then develop a comprehensive campaign plan. This includes the development of a creative message strategy and advertising campaign as well as a strategic media plan.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/dorothy-decarlo.html">3.0</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/dorothy-decarlo.html">Dorothy</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/dorothy-decarlo.html">DeCarlo</a></td><td>1:30 PM</td><td>3:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>23267</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
