Drawing on a variety of materialist perspectives, students study the economic and cultural instrumentality that different family structures and constructions of sexuality, gender, and race have held across time and place and how and why such structures have changed. Students also analyze the cultural logic of disposability in capitalism, both in terms of garbage-generation and the generation of surplus populations.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/heidi-nast.html">3.26</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/heidi-nast.html">Heidi</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/heidi-nast.html">Nast</a></td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20520</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
