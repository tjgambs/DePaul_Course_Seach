Candidates will be exposed to the multiple frameworks that inform education research and various methodologies employed in collecting and analyzing data. During the last 6 weeks of the course, the course focuses on research related to the teaching of mathematics in the middle school and high school and pedagogical content knowledge, including research on teaching and learning, curricula and instructional delivery, assessment, and the relationship of socio-cultural, economic, and language use to teaching and learning disciplinary-specific content. Students will develop and implement small discipline-specific research projects, identifying research questions, conducting a literature search, developing a theoretical framework, and collecting and analyzing data.
