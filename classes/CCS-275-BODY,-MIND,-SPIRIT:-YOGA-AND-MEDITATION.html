This course answers that question with an introduction to yoga and meditation techniques and the underlying scientific and philosophical principles of the system of yoga. The first half of each class will be experiential, conducted as a yoga and meditation class for beginners, providing tools to reduce stress, focus the mind, and cultivate inner peace. This first hour and a half will use yoga postures, breathing exercises, and meditation techniques. The second half of each class will use readings, reflection, and discussion to examine the scientific and philosophical knowledge of yoga as a way to ease stress, strengthen the bone and muscle structures, lower blood pressure, increase flexibility and strength, improve mind functioning, and provide spiritual sustenance. We will read Yoga Mind Body and Spirit: A Return to Wholeness by Donna Farhi, and the The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, research articles on the scientific studies of yoga's benefits from journals and websites, etc. Students will keep weekly reflection journal observations on the changes(s) they notice in themselves.
