Course explores issues influencing early childhood education, such as socio-historical factors, family policy, diversity, and federal/state regulations. Students examine programs using readings from the Vincentian Collection, child psychology, social theories and the current media. Students compare Vincentian Heritage, current and past federal policies, applying this study to their understanding of social justice to modern childcare practices.  To guide students deeper into understanding the lives of young children, the course offers an option for service learning with Jumpstart, Chicago-area Head Start, and other early childhood education centers.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/gayle-mindes.html">2.6</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/gayle-mindes.html">Gayle</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/gayle-mindes.html">Mindes</a></td><td>8:30 AM</td><td>11:45 AM</td><td>201</td><td>24582</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Friday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
