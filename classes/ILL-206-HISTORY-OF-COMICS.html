Students will be introduced to the evolution of the art form from 18th century precursors, to late 19th century newspaper pages, to the 20th century comic book, through today's sophisticated graphic novels. The course will devote considerable time to comics of other cultures, with special emphasis on Japan and Europe. It will also examine the relationship of comics to culture at large, and the struggle of underground and alternative comic artists to explore adult subjects such as politics and gender.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>26765</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>26765</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
