Utilizing the pastoral cycle of "See, Judge, and Act" within the Catholic Social tradition, students will critically reflect on their tutoring experience as it relates to local economic, cultural and political issues surrounding the Englewood and Back of the Yards neighborhoods. In addition they will explore a variety of domestic and global justice issues through the lens of Catholic Social Teaching.  Through this hermeneutic, they will gain a familiarity with terms and concepts to more thoroughly analyze and critique social systems. The students will also learn more about the Dominican and LaSallian charism towards marginalized populations and reflect on their own personal responsibility as members of a community bound to their religious mission. As a service-enhanced course, students will actively engage in critical reflection and dialogue on their tutoring experience through the use of readings, videos, guest speakers, group projects/presentations, and designated field trips to related organizations.
