The course content engages students in examining philosophical, ideological, social, political, and cultural fault lines that offer opportunities to deepen and extend our understandings about discourses on women's and gender studies constructions and negotiations, in the late 20th century as well as in the early 21st century.  The lens through which particular issues and ideas are viewed draws upon multiple perspectives, taking into consideration issues of culture and context, grounded in examining specificities of the local in relationship to global or transnational dynamics.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Sandra</td><td>Jackson</td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20939</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
