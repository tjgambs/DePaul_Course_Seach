It introduces students to the basics of the language of the ancient Athenians, Attic Greek, which includes the Greek alphabet, pronunciation and the beginnings of Greek grammar. Students will begin to develop reading and writing skills as they encounter small passages of ancient Greek text, the standard method for learning this ancient tongue being partly memorization and partly language immersion. Students will be expected to read through small passages of ancient Greek, but not without assistance. This course focuses primarily on syntax, grammar and memorization of paradigms, yet students also translate ancient Greek as they proceed, learning rudiments of the language as well as cultural aspects of the ancient Greeks at varying epochs.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/kirk-shellko.html">4.3</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/kirk-shellko.html">Kirk</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/kirk-shellko.html">Shellko</a></td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>20471</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
