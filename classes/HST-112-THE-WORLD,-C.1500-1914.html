Then, beginning in the 13th Century C.E., this began to change. Slowly at first, and then ever-faster, all of the world's peoples became part of a single world civilization, whether they liked it or not. By about 1914, there was only one world civilization, with local variants. How and why did this happen? Who benefitted, and who did not, from this momentous change? This course seeks to answer these questions as we look at the world's civilizations and at the forces and events that drove them together.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/brian-boeck.html">4.2</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/brian-boeck.html">Brian</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/brian-boeck.html">Boeck</a></td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26105</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Frederic</td><td>Kopp</td><td>8:30 AM</td><td>10:00 AM</td><td>501</td><td>20484</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
