The first part of the course is devoted to the two general classes of derivative pricing models:  discrete time and continuous time, with each model's properties discussed in detail.  These models are then applied to a range of realistic pricing situations which include swaps, exotic options and fixed income derivatives.  The course concludes with a detailed examination of value at risk.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/carl-luft.html">2.67</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/carl-luft.html">Carl</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/carl-luft.html">Luft</a></td><td>10:10 AM</td><td>11:40 AM</td><td>501</td><td>24934</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
