Candidates learn to assess the reading needs of students in content area courses and to design, select, modify, and evaluate a wide range of materials for the content areas. The course goes beyond teaching a set of isolated generic reading comprehension skills and provides strategies that can be applied across content areas to prepare diverse, at-risk, and exceptional students to read, write, talk, and think critically about complex texts, and to develop positive literacy identities. Attention is given to incorporating Common Core standards and IEP goals into instruction.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Amy</td><td>Feiker Hollenbeck</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26632</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
