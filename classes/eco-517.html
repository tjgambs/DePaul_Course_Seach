Individuals now sit on the boards of public and private companies and are being asked to provide business analysis and networking skills.  Moreover, many firms have established PACS and have set-up governmental practice sections.  These firms are also becoming more dependent on the government for business opportunities and are more involved in fundraising on behalf of public officials in order to gain access and to influence the regulatory and legislative process.  In fact many business people have raised money for both political parties with the hope of leveraging their contributions for future work or political appointments.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Stephen</td><td>Carlton</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>25057</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Thursday</td></tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/robert-kallen.html" style="text-decoration:none">4.0</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/robert-kallen.html" style="text-decoration:none">Robert</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/robert-kallen.html" style="text-decoration:none">Kallen</a></td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>25057</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Thursday</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
