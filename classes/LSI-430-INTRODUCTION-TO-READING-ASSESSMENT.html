Students will be introduced to formal and informal measures of reading achievement and development, and will have scaffolded opportunities to administer, interpret, and use results for instructional planning. Additional topics to be covered include characteristics of informal and formal assessment (e.g., test construction, reliability and validity, and non-discriminatory testing), and the roles of assessment in the diagnosis and identification of reading disabilities. Students will be introduced to case report writing to deepen their understanding of reading difficulties as well as to clearly communicate assessment findings to a variety of individuals, including parents.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Amy</td><td>Feiker Hollenbeck</td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26707</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
