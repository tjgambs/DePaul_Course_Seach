Through various translation assignments, students will be able to review German grammar, work within different registers and learn appropriate vocabulary, expand their reading and writing in German while developing a sense of responsibility for the text translated. This course will present a survey of translation theory, particularly as it relates to Germany, and probe the usefulness of technology. GER 106 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Eugene</td><td>Sampson</td><td>10:30 AM</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26210</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday</td> </tr>
