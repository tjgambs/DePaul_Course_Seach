This demand creates career opportunities for people with the knowledge of a second language. Chinese 321 - Translation Practice and Theories - is designed to help Chinese-language students grasp the skills and theories needed to render Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese translations. Through hands-on practice, a survey of major theories of translation, group and class discussions, and lectures, this course will teach students how to comprehend source texts accurately and deeply from both linguistic and cultural perspectives; how to express faithfully, fully, and coherently in the target language the idea of a source text; how to apply grammatical rules, rhetorical devices, diction, etc. in translation; how to use editing skills to enhance translation results; and how to use different language styles to render different materials. CHN 106 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/yingcai-xu.html">3.5</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/yingcai-xu.html">Yingcai</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/yingcai-xu.html">Xu</a></td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>26025</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
