It significantly altered the nation's social structure and self-understanding and liberated a people from disenfranchisement.  This course looks at the high points along the road to social justice for African-Americans and the associated changes that resulted in the legal, social, economic, and political systems of the land.  Students will trace key developments from the 1954 Supreme Court ruling that integrated schools to our current racial situation by watching the award-winning PBS series and reading a significant book on the topic.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>R.</td><td>Sautter</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>801</td><td>24052</td><td>Off Campus</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>R.</td><td>Sautter</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>802</td><td>24053</td><td>Off Campus</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>R.</td><td>Sautter</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>803</td><td>24054</td><td>Off Campus</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
