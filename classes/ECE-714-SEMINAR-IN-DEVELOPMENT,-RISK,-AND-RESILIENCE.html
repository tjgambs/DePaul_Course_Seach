An issue of interest will be the development of children who are at-risk due to environmental factors.  The U.S. policies in addressing this population will be examined. 

The seminar will have the following objectives:  1) In-depth analysis of the concepts of risk and resilience through examination of the original research literature. 2) Examination and analysis of various risk factors (e.g.: genetics, biology, poverty, family, socio political influences) with attention given to neurobiological risk factors, including disabilities. 3) Examination and analysis of factors of resilience (including implications for intervention and early childhood education). 4) Examination and analysis of U.S. Policies in relationship to promotion of resilience via early childhood intervention and education programs.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/mojdeh-bayat.html">4.93</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/mojdeh-bayat.html">Mojdeh</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/mojdeh-bayat.html">Bayat</a></td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26636</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
