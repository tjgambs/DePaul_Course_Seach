The difference between these forms of play is one of degree rather than one of kind.  A theater game provides a structure in which we can play spontaneously.  In other words, we improvise.  Improvisation aids in the developing of public speaking skills and comfort and confidence as well as other social and theatrical skills. May be taken for only one competence.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>2</td><td>John</td><td>Starrs</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>23563</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>2</td><td>John</td><td>Starrs</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>802</td><td>23564</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>2</td><td>John</td><td>Starrs</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>803</td><td>23565</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
