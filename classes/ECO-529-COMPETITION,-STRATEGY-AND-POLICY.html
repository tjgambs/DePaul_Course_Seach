The main goals are to understand basic firm behaviors and interactions under various industry configurations, and to scrutinize these behaviors and interactions through the lenses of competition policies (antitrust laws and regulation). We will draw on microeconomic theory, game theory and competitive strategy, as well as empirical evidence and a variety of case studies.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>4</td><td>Rafael</td><td>Tenorio</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26875</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
