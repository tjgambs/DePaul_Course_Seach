As the world grows increasingly complex and interconnected, the ability to understand and navigate people-in-groups (organizational, societal, and global) becomes increasingly critical. In this domain, students broaden and deepen their capacity to make a difference at ever-widening levels of system. Central questions include: How do we engage as organizational resources, community participants, members of society and global citizens? How do we get along? How do we get work done? How do we both fit-in and remain unique? Seminar sections in this domain might include such topics as project management, leadership, organizational culture, career management, performance improvement, context scanning, global citizenship, trend analysis, cross-cultural agility, future visioning, etc.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Edward</td><td>Paulson</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>23525</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
