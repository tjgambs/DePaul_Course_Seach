The event must be sponsored by a non-profit organization and the student is to contribute his or her hospitality knowledge and skills toward the production of the event. The event or organization sponsoring it does not have to be in the hospitality industry, but the activity must be hospitality in nature.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/shelley-gibbons.html">5.0</a></td><td>Open</td><td>0</td><td><a href = "../teachers/shelley-gibbons.html">Shelley</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/shelley-gibbons.html">Gibbons</a></td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>520</td><td>23116</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
