Students will learn successive highlights of inquiry within scientific culture, beginning in prehistory and ancient Egypt. As they proceed from Egypt through the ancient Greek enlightenment and onto Roman science and its decline, students will learn the basics of how representative thinkers evaluated and altered "contemporary" understanding. Students will witness firsthand the ever-changing perspective of scientific knowledge and compare it with modern empirical methodology. They will acquire an ability to interpret varying viewpoints of "science" through an overview of changes of perception combined with selected readings from the works of ancient philosophers, physicists and physicians. Students will also learn the composition of scientific terminology; they will learn how to analyze, dissect and compose scientific terms based upon the Classical languages of ancient Greece and Rome.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/kirk-shellko.html">4.3</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/kirk-shellko.html">Kirk</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/kirk-shellko.html">Shellko</a></td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>21279</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
