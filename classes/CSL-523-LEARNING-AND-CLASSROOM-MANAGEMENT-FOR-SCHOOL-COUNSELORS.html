The history of foundational learning approaches is also covered particularly those from the 19th and 20th centuries. Classroom management models and theories of inner discipline and consistency management are discussed so that the school counselor can assist educators and parents in home-school management of youth. Students develop original lesson plans, and observe and interview current educators as a part of this course.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/erin-mason.html">5.0</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>26702</td><td><a href = "../teachers/erin-mason.html">Erin</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/erin-mason.html">Mason</a></td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26702</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
