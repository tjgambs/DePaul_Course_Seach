Though students will review and perfect their knowledge of German grammar throughout the year, they will focus on the perfection of the four language skills reading, writing, listening and speaking. Students will have ample opportunities to express themselves in German, acquire basic discussion strategies, and gain insight into many aspects of the contemporary cultures and societies of German-speaking countries. GER 104 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/eugene-sampson.html">4.8</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/eugene-sampson.html">Eugene</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/eugene-sampson.html">Sampson</a></td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20469</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/eugene-sampson.html">4.8</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/eugene-sampson.html">Eugene</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/eugene-sampson.html">Sampson</a></td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>202</td><td>26084</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
