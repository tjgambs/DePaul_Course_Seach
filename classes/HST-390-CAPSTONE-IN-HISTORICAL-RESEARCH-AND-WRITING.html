It is also an excellent way for students to experience firsthand the linkages between broad reading in a given field and subsequent primary-source based research in that field. Every autumn and winter quarter, certain 300-level course offerings will be designated as Capstone-linked classes. Students ready to take this course can choose among the offerings as suits their interests.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Colleen</td><td>Doody</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20789</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Eugene</td><td>Beiriger</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>202</td><td>20790</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
