Lesson and unit development, evaluation/assessment, and classroom management also will be discussed. Issues that emerge in planning and instruction are discussed and deliberated through university classroom experiences as well as required fieldwork (20/15 hours; level 1 in language of certification).<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-johnston.html">4.55</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-johnston.html">Mark</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-johnston.html">Johnston</a></td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>801</td><td>24588</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
