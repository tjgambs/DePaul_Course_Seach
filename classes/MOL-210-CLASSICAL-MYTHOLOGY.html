It endeavors to place Classical literature into its historical, social and cultural contexts. Students will learn significant myths and the names and functions of the most important characters in them. They will investigate how the ancients used traditional narratives and images to explore, explain and experiment with ideas about themselves and their surroundings in those contexts. Learning about how myth is variously interpreted (as for example by means of theories of myth-interpretation) as well as basic methods of literary criticism (e.g., analysis of language, content, structure, etc.), students will employ ways to identify, understand and interpret the different types of communication present in myth-literature. As they move chronologically through the ancient world students will observe how myths change to reflect differing individual and collective concerns, as well as the specific interests (and so the significant aspects of discourse) of authors and audiences as conditions change. Students will also learn about literary genres, including poetry, tragedy and prose, their properties and distinctions and discover how genres also reflect audiences and times. Students will read and evaluate modern views of myth in order to understand how myth is open to multiple interpretations and upon what sounder bases myth is to be interpreted. While analyzing myths' diversity in various forms of literature, students will come to comprehend what mythology meant to the ancients, as well as those facets and ingredients of myth that are universal, enduring, and meaningful today.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/matthew-baumann.html">&nbsp;</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/matthew-baumann.html">Matthew</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/matthew-baumann.html">Baumann</a></td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>21138</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/matthew-baumann.html">&nbsp;</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/matthew-baumann.html">Matthew</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/matthew-baumann.html">Baumann</a></td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>202</td><td>21139</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Giancarlo</td><td>Tarantino</td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>203</td><td>21136</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
