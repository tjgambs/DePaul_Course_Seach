The prediction, explanation and management of individual and group behavior in the organization is dependent upon an understanding of the concepts of organizational behavior. Classroom experiences will focus on both understanding and practicing these concepts. Topics cover both the individual level - e.g. perception, attitudes, motivation - and the group level - e.g. leadership, group dynamics, communication, power and politics, and decision making.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Robert</td><td>Rubin</td><td>8:30 AM</td><td>5:00 PM</td><td>501</td><td>24680</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Charles</td><td>Naquin</td><td>11:50 AM</td><td>1:20 PM</td><td>502</td><td>24681</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr>
