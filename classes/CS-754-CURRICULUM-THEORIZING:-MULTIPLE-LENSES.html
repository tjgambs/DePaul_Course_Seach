Major topics include: frameworks for defining and conceptualizing curriculum and curricular visions; social, political, and historical contexts of curriculum construction; issues of gender, race, class ableness, and the media; the curriculum as socially constructed, and historically contextualized discourse(s) about what is and what should be taught.
