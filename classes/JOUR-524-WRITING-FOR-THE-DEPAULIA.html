Students will cover stories from each section of the paper (news, features, entertainment, opinion and sports) throughout the quarter.  Some assignments will come from DePaulia editors, but students are expected to come up with their own ideas.  Stories can be as varied as campus news or news in the Lincoln Park and South Loop communities.  Supplementing stories with photos and video is expected.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/marla-krause.html">3.4</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/marla-krause.html">Marla</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/marla-krause.html">Krause</a></td><td>3:10 PM</td><td>4:40 PM</td><td>201</td><td>23197</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
