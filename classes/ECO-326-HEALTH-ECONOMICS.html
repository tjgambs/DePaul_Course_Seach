Students will consider conceptual and empirical analyses of: supply of and demand for health and medical services; role of insurance; influence of physicians and hospitals on price, quantity, and quality of services; factors that distort the market; and the impact of technological change on health care cost. The recent changes in federal law regarding health insurance coverage are considered as well.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Closed</td><td>4</td><td>25053</td><td>Mohammad</td><td>Mirhosseini</td><td>11:50 AM</td><td>1:20 PM</td><td>801</td><td>25053</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
