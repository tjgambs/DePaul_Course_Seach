To develop interpersonal effectiveness, one must overcome the barriers that result from differences in culture, race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, and socio-economic status. Interpersonal effectiveness requires self-awareness, cultural competence, and skills in active listening, building trust, dialogue, collaboration, and conflict resolution. Central questions include: How can we improve interpersonal relationships in both personal and professional domains? How can we make decisions and solve problems together? What are the dynamics of and processes for collaboration? How do we understand and use the human/computer interface as tool to enhance communication? Seminar sections in this domain might include such topics as intercultural communication, valuing human similarities and differences, interpersonal communication, 21st century human-computer interfaces and interactions, etc.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Michael</td><td>Mecozzi</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>23524</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
