This is an online course.  Students are required to work at least 100 hours during the quarter in which they are enrolled in the class. Attendance at an internship orientation is required. All of our 4-credit UIP courses fulfill the JYEL learning requirement. If you have completed the requirement already, the course will be counted as a general elective course.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-onuscheck.html">4.8</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-onuscheck.html">Mark</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-onuscheck.html">Onuscheck</a></td><td></td><td></td><td>201</td><td>20972</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/robert-wilcox.html">3.5</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/robert-wilcox.html">Robert</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/robert-wilcox.html">Wilcox</a></td><td></td><td></td><td>202</td><td>21118</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr></table></body></html>
