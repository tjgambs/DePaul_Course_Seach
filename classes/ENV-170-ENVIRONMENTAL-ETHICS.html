Students will explore and evaluate diverse approaches to a range of such issues, as well as the ways different thinkers and different cultures have envisioned the relationship between human beings and the natural world-all with a view to understanding their own relationships to the natural world, their own environmental ethics.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/michael-edwards.html">4.0</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/michael-edwards.html">Michael</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/michael-edwards.html">Edwards</a></td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26531</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
