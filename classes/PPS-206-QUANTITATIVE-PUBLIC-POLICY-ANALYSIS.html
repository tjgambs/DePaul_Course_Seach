A significant portion of the course work will involve doing statistical analyses of existing data using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) in the computer lab. Students will prepare a substantial paper using the techniques for public policy analysis learned in class. Students majoring in PPS are strongly encouraged to have completed PPS 205 before taking this course. This core course for PPS majors and minors should be taken before the senior year.
