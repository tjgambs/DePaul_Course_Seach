While fear and loss can paralyze, they can also mobilize. In addition to destroying generations of artists, AIDS has become what some call "the great unifier," giving voice to a new generation of theatre artists. But what are these voices? Cries for social change? Political rants? Stories of remembrance? Lessons to educate? All of the above? What does AIDS mean when it appears onstage in a performance? By interpreting and analyzing plays from both national and global AIDS perspectives, reading critical and reflective essays, and through discussion, students in the course will
discover how the ritual of theatre has been used to create the eclectic quilt of voices that is AIDS drama.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/ernest-nolan.html">4.9</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/ernest-nolan.html">Ernest</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/ernest-nolan.html">Nolan</a></td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26496</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
