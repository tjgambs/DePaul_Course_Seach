The overriding concern of Honors 104 is with the meaning and function of culture as a system or world that we inhabit. This world with its distinctive concepts of ultimacy, time, space, cosmos, and life passages is created and enacted through myths, narratives, and ritual performances. Students will develop analytical skills necessary to apply theoretical explanations and interpretations to the process of constructing cultural reality. All sections of the course will involve a field experience in which students enter the world of a community which is not part of their own experience.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Kalyani</td><td>Menon</td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>20496</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Lisa</td><td>Poirier</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>202</td><td>20497</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Jaime</td><td>Waters</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>203</td><td>20498</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Lisa</td><td>Poirier</td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>204</td><td>21467</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>James</td><td>Halstead</td><td>1:30 PM</td><td>3:00 PM</td><td>501</td><td>20499</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
