Intermediate Arabic will focus on broadening students' knowledge of the Arabic language beyond the daily life topics. Students will be introduced to examples of authentic materials of Arabic Literature that include topics of general and professional interests, in order to increase students' comprehension skills and prepare them to understand the literary and cultural context of the Arabic language. In addition, this course will emphasize two main points: (1) how mastering grammar concepts is crucial for understanding Arabic texts as well as for communicating clearly in speech and writing; and (2) how the derivation system is key for developing vocabulary. ARB 104 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>2:40 PM</td><td>4:10 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20399</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
