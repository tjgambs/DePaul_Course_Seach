Improvisation for performance was developed by The Compass Players and The Second City and has influenced generations of theatre artists from Alan Arkin to Tina Fey.  The essentials of improvisation, however, remain applicable to everyone.  In this course, sessions will include theatre games, ensemble building exercises, and scene structures.  We will explore how the practice of improvisation creates opportunities for connection, creativity, and spontaneity.  This class is for anyone who wants to enhance their abilities to act and interact with others.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/james-sherman.html" style="text-decoration:none">3.1</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/james-sherman.html" style="text-decoration:none">James</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/james-sherman.html" style="text-decoration:none">Sherman</a></td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26516</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
