In this class, students will bring to bear the skills in historical sources and methods learned in HST 298 to complete a substantial independent research project.  To that end, students will learn how to identify  a historical question or problem about which to conduct research; how to find, obtain, and evaluate primary source evidence to research; how to build a secondary source bibliography using reference works, monographs, and scholarly journal articles; and develop and execute a coherent plan for writing and revising a substantial research paper (of at least 10 pages in length) based on an integrated use of both primary and secondary sources.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/brian-boeck.html">4.2</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/brian-boeck.html">Brian</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/brian-boeck.html">Boeck</a></td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20489</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/valentina-tikoff.html">3.72</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/valentina-tikoff.html">Valentina</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/valentina-tikoff.html">Tikoff</a></td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>801</td><td>20490</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
