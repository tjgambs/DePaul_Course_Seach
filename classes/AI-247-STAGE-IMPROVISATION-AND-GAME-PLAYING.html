Students will learn the games that form a context with which, or from which, to improvise.  Then, they will improvise; they will play in their own and in each others' improvised sketches. They will learn to solve problems, find metaphors and examine improvisation as an excellent tool with which to monitor the process of learning. Additionally, students will acquaint themselves with the history of this freest of forms. From the engagement in the games and their analysis will come the most important outcome: the growth of confidence.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>John</td><td>Starrs</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>23883</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>John</td><td>Starrs</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>802</td><td>23884</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>John</td><td>Starrs</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>803</td><td>23885</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>John</td><td>Starrs</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>804</td><td>23886</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
