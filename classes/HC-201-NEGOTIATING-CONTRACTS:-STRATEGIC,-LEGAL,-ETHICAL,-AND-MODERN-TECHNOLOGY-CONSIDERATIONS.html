We will delve into the realm of analyzing our world as we perceive it and the art of entering into the realm of another's perception.   We will utilize "four agreements" as a method of managing our perceptions and the perceptions of others, and as an approach for communication.   In learning to communicate with others we will utilize a technique called "matching."  

We will examine the development of contract law.  We will cover the basics of contract formation: offer, acceptance and consideration.  We will identify which contracts are required to be in writing.  We will examine the remedies available when a contract is breached.  We will review various examples of contracts to evaluate the practical application of what we learned.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>2</td><td>Patricia</td><td>Rocco</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>23910</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>2</td><td>Patricia</td><td>Rocco</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>802</td><td>23911</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>2</td><td>Patricia</td><td>Rocco</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>803</td><td>23912</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>2</td><td>Patricia</td><td>Rocco</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>804</td><td>23913</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>2</td><td>Patricia</td><td>Rocco</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>805</td><td>23914</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
