A personal feeling of well-being includes "emotional happiness" and the rational satisfaction with one's own life.  In this course you will attempt to define the term "well-being" and discover its relationship with other concepts such as mental health and life satisfaction.  How does physical exercise influence well-being? How do positive and negative life events influence well-being?  Do good social relationships guarantee happiness?  Do the expectations one has in life with regard to income influence well-being?  Is it important to set goals to achieve a high level of well-being? These and other questions will be addressed in this course. You will try to define some of things a person can do to increase his or her level of well-being.   Others' ideas serve as common course content, as presented in the material assigned to this course.  You will be asked to participate actively and critically, to work individually and in study groups, using your own experience as a field of analysis and reflection.  Active group participation will foster a harmonic, interactive environment, which might increase positive relationships among students and foster a feeling of well-being throughout this course.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>2</td><td>Shannon</td><td>Olison</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>801</td><td>23556</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>2</td><td>Valerie</td><td>Worthington</td><td></td><td></td><td>802</td><td>23821</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>2</td><td>Elizabeth</td><td>Leavy</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>803</td><td>23822</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr></table></body></html>
