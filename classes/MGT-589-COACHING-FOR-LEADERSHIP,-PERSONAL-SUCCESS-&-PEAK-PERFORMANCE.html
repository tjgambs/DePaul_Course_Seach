Grounded in positive psychology and the science of human flourishing, participants will identify and apply strengths based interventions to promote organizational effectiveness, career success and life fulfillment.  Students will learn and deploy the GROW model of coaching, motivational interviewing, solution focused coaching, mindfulness, and goal focused approaches to help people achieve change.  Participants will also enhance their own ability to create presence, build trust, manage self- awareness, listen, ask powerful questions, design actions and manage accountability.  Working from a place of purpose and intention course participants will harness competitive advantage, explore finding flow, managing stress, maintaining optimism, and creating balance in work, health and family.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/david-drehmer.html">4.5</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>25015</td><td><a href = "../teachers/david-drehmer.html">David</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/david-drehmer.html">Drehmer</a></td><td>9:00 AM</td><td>4:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>25015</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Saturday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
