Topics covered include the relationship between game design and play, the role of games in fueling the technological imagination, the changing contexts in which games are designed and played (art, social impact, health, education), and the rise of the independent games sector. Students will produce weekly written responses to course material, lead a seminar discussion in small teams, and produce a final written or multimedia paper.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/michael-hiessboeck.html">3.25</a></td><td>Closed</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/michael-hiessboeck.html">Michael</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/michael-hiessboeck.html">Hiessboeck</a></td><td>1:30 PM</td><td>3:00 PM</td><td>501</td><td>22871</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
