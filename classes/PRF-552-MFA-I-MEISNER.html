In this first of a two quarter sequence, actors will participate in a sequence of structured improvisational exercises focused on the first half of that sentence: living truthfully. The foundational exercise is called Repetition. Using Repetition as a base, students will explore exercises specifically designed to improve their listening and answering skills and increase their ability to respond to their partner moment to moment.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Trudie</td><td>Kessler</td><td>1:30 PM</td><td>3:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>25306</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
