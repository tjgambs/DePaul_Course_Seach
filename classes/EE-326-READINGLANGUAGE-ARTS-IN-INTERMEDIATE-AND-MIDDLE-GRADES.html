It focuses on the further development of reading comprehension and writing abilities in the intermediate grades and middle school.  Emphasis is placed on the complex nature of literacy addressing issues such as content-area literacies, learning in and across languages, and critically consuming and producing a wide variety of texts (including online, multimedia and print based).  Application of course material is facilitated through the design, teaching, and reflection on literacy lesson(s) for intermediate learners in required field experiences.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Frank</td><td>Tavano</td><td>8:00 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>24388</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
