Lectures consider the struggle of artists to articulate newly sovereign identities through visual production, even as complicated relationships with Europe and increasingly, the United States, continue. Topics covered include Latin American modernism, surrealism, radical arts, and social realism, with a special consideration of post-revolutionary Mexican mural painting.
