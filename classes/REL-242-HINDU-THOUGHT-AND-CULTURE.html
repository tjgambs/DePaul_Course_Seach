Despite its variety, certain themes have remained throughout the ages--karma and ethical responsibility, liberation from the bonds of worldly existence through yoga and devotion, communication with the divine through ritual, and the many forms, male and female, that God can take. This course traces the development of Hinduism from 5000 years ago to the present, with emphasis on change and continuity in those themes.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/david-gitomer.html">2.78</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/david-gitomer.html">David</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/david-gitomer.html">Gitomer</a></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>801</td><td>26323</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
