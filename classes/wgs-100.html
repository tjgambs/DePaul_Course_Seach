Topics will include women's identities; body image and the media; women's sexuality; intimate relationships and families; women, violence and criminalization; women's work, wage discrimination, and welfare reform; women's health issues, such as reproductive rights, and medical research. Participants will have opportunities to examine ways that this stratification interacts in varied eras, cultures, and sub-cultures to shape women's lives. Students will engage in an activist focus as they are introduced to the layers of oppression that affect many women's lives, from the personal to the global. As they analyze social, cultural, and political issues through "gendered lenses", participants may expand a view of their personal lives to include a framework that encourages resilient responses to such oppression.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/heather-rakes.html" style="text-decoration:none">2.6</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/heather-rakes.html" style="text-decoration:none">Heather</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/heather-rakes.html" style="text-decoration:none">Rakes</a></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>801</td><td>20720</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
