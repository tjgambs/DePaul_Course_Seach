Emphasis is placed on understanding how children develop problem-solving skills, and on recognizing how teachers can facilitate inquiry-discovery experiences for young children with diverse learning styles and needs.  Course assignments include participation in experiments and field-based experiences in mathematics and sciences.  Teacher candidates are required to develop and provide developmentally and culturally appropriate activities in science and mathematics activities for young children.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Alice</td><td>Moss</td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>201</td><td>24484</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
