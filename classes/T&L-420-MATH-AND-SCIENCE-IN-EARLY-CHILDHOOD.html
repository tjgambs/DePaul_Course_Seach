Emphasis is placed on understanding how children develop problem-solving skills, and on recognizing how teachers can facilitate inquiry-discovery experiences for young children with diverse learning styles and needs.  Course assignments include participation in experiments and field-based experiences in mathematics and sciences.  Teacher candidates are required to develop and provide developmentally and culturally appropriate activities in science and mathematics activities for young children.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/alice-moss.html">3.73</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/alice-moss.html">Alice</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/alice-moss.html">Moss</a></td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>201</td><td>24484</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
