The focus will be on determining the impact, magnitude, and patterns of disease/illness/injury frequency so that causal agents can be identified and effective prevention, treatment and control measures can be designed and implemented.  The course will explore variations of disease/illness/injury in relation to such factors as age, sex, race/ethnicity, occupational and social characteristics, place of residence, social inequality, susceptibility, exposure to specific agents, and other pertinent characteristics.  Also of concern will be the temporal distribution of disease, examination of trends, cyclical patterns, and intervals between exposure to causative factors and onset of disease.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>20835</td><td>Julia</td><td>Lippert</td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20835</td><td>Off Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>26200</td><td>Julia</td><td>Lippert</td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>202</td><td>26200</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
