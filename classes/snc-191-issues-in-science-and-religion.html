The institutions and bodies of knowledge comprising science, religion, and their overlap are critically analyzed. Key historic debates are examined, for example: the Vatican's trial of Galileo for his teachings of a heliocentric universe; the controversial reception of Darwin's theory of evolution; and the 2001 U.S. policy on embryonic stem cell research. Through such analyses, the course develops students' skills in making ethically-informed decisions and thus recognizing their roles in the public debates involving the intersection of science and religion.  Self, Society and the Modern World.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Donald</td><td>Opitz</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>801</td><td>23820</td><td>OnLine</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
