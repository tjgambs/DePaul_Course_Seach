The forms of games, their experiential qualities, and their cultural significance have varied enormously from era to era and place to place. This class will examine particular games and game genres in their historical context using a case study format. We will focus on "indoor" games, those of chance and skill, as opposed to physical games and sports. The examples will be chosen (i) to have global scope and historic diversity, (ii) to relate to games that students will find familiar, and (iii) to raise particular issues in historical interpretation, the use of primary sources and changing concepts of leisure activity.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Closed</td><td>4</td><td>22409</td><td>Jonathan</td><td>Hey</td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>22409</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Closed</td><td>4</td><td>22410</td><td>Jonathan</td><td>Hey</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>202</td><td>22410</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/johnny-wilson.html">2.4</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>22411</td><td><a href = "../teachers/johnny-wilson.html">Johnny</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/johnny-wilson.html">Wilson</a></td><td>1:30 PM</td><td>3:00 PM</td><td>501</td><td>22411</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
