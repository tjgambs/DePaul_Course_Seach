We examine how the conceptions, meanings, and values of nature today have been influenced by the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions, Romanticism, and evolutionary theory; notions of the sublime, the frontier, and wilderness; and the practices of conservation, preservation, and restoration. Also discussed are the ideological commitments of current environmentalisms, in particular sustainability.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Shawn</td><td>Bailey</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26519</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
