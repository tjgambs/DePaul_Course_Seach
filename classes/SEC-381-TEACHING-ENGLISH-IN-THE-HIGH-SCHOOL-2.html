The course provides students opportunities to continue to explore and develop research-based and theoretically grounded best practices in the teaching of reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills and sensibilities, with an emphasis on reflective and collaborative practice. The course provides extensive opportunities for planning, using, and evaluating a variety of instructional strategies, including the use of technology resources, through teaching demonstrations and modeling and field experiences. Students will fine-tune and reflect on writing instructional objectives, developing lesson plans, designing a curriculum unit, creating a classroom environment, and implementing instructional delivery strategies and methods that meet the needs of diverse learners, including English language learners and students who speak nonmainstream dialects of English. And like in SEC 371, students will reflect on and clearly articulate orally, in writing, and through practice an educational philosophy and theory. Students will also demonstrate commitment to teaching as a professional who acts responsibly, ethically, and collegially in accordance to Vincentian personalism. 30 Level 2 Field Experience hours required. COREQUISITE(S): Taken in conjunction with SCU 351.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/christopher-worthman.html">2.4</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>24468</td><td><a href = "../teachers/christopher-worthman.html">Christopher</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/christopher-worthman.html">Worthman</a></td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>801</td><td>24468</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/jennifer-cohen.html">2.5</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>26436</td><td><a href = "../teachers/jennifer-cohen.html">Jennifer</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/jennifer-cohen.html">Cohen</a></td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>802</td><td>26436</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
