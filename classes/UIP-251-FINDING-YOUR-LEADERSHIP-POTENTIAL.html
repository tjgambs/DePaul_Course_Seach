Students will also strengthen key leadership skills, apply those skills at their internship sites and identify ways to be a leader in a potential career. This is a hybrid course that will meet five times per quarter. Students are required to work 100 hours. Attendance at an internship orientation is required.
 All of our 4-credit UIP courses fulfill the JYEL learning requirement. If you have completed the requirement already, the course will be counted as a general elective course.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Julie</td><td>Adrianopoli</td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>8:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>20969</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Julie</td><td>Adrianopoli</td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>8:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>20969</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Julie</td><td>Adrianopoli</td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>8:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>20969</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Julie</td><td>Adrianopoli</td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>8:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>20969</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
