Through cases and discussion of topical issues, the course provides the student with an opportunity to analyze practical financial situations and problems. The course requires the student to be familiar with fundamental concepts such as valuation methods (WACC, Free Cash Flow and Capital Cash Flow, APV, Trading and Transaction Multiples), portfolio selection, CAPM, and analysis of capital structure. The course emphasis is sufficiently general so as to be of interest to a wide cross-section of students. At its most fundamental level, the course attempts to improve problem-solving skills that relate to problem definition, gathering and organizing the relevant information, developing feasible alternative courses of action, evaluating alternative choices, and recommending and defending the best course of action. In addition to analyzing specific problems or issues, the course will consider how these issues relate to the strategic objectives of the firm and examine the "big picture" assumptions that are used in the numerical calculations.  FIN 553 is strongly recommended.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/ramon-codina.html">3.48</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/ramon-codina.html">Ramon</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/ramon-codina.html">Codina</a></td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>201</td><td>24951</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
