This course will give students a review of grammar and forms along with reading exercises. Students concentrate on reading large sections of text in an effort to derive meaning and historical significance. Continued drill on forms and reading for comprehension are the tools used by students. Students will be expected to read through passages of Latin with relative dexterity, and they will begin to parse through the texts in class in order to inculcate the skills of navigating entire narratives. Students begin to develop an affinity for specific authors from the poetic tradition of the Romans. LAT 114 emphasizes the completion of prose texts in order that the student become more comfortable with the ancient language.
