The Applied Research course requirements focus on key aspects of inquiry. Students create a research proposal responding to a purpose, problem, and question each chooses to target (but do not actually carry out the data collection or analysis during this particular quarter).  Students will explore research methodologies"quantitative and qualitative" and create a research design proposal based on a literature review and carefully constructed question, hypothesis, and methodology.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Cynthia</td><td>Stevens</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>801</td><td>23731</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr>
