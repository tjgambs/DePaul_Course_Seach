The group of courses in this area would cover urban issues, whether related to Chicago or other city/cities, or issues of race and ethnicity. These courses might cover topics on space, planning, and history of cities; or labor, work, and employment in urban contexts; or racial identity formation. As the majority of people living in the world today inhabit cities, this category of courses considers the many factors that transform racial make-up of urban areas. Courses might ask such questions as: What is the effect of rapid economic change on different races and their jobs in cities? What environmental features of cities affect race relations? What processes involving resource and energy consumption concern racial groups in different ways?<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/adrienne-holloway.html">3.63</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/adrienne-holloway.html">Adrienne</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/adrienne-holloway.html">Holloway</a></td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26204</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
