Students will discuss a wide range of topics, and they will practice conversational strategies for a variety of situations. Upon completing this course, students should be able to do the following: 1) talk about the past in a coherent and fairly detailed manner; 2) deal effectively with unanticipated complications (e.g., a lost ticket); 3) adapt to formal and informal situations; 4) speak broadly on topics of personal interest; and 5) make themselves easily understood by Spanish speakers who are unaccustomed to dealing with non-native speakers. Class preparation will include readings (from various genres) and films. SPN 106 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/alejandra-viti.html">4.8</a></td><td>Closed</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/alejandra-viti.html">Alejandra</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/alejandra-viti.html">Viti</a></td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>21366</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
