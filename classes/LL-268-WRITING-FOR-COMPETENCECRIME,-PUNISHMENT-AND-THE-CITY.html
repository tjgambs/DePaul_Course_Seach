At its core, this novel asks questions that are still relevant today. Some of these questions include:
-How can families survive in an urban environment? 
-How do people justify violence and neglect? 
-Should we allow a person's mental state to influence their punishment?
Of course, these questions only represent a starting place for our investigations of this novel. All students will examine how society and the city shape the behavior of individuals in a series of essays written in a variety of writing genres.  Students who take the class for the A4 competence will supplement this exploration of the novel with their personal experience and ideas developed by thinkers like Lev Tolstoy, Michel Foucault and Martin Buber.

The skills you learn in this class are widely applicable and will help you improve your business and other writing. However, we will focus particular attention on writing to excel in SNL's writing-intensive curriculum. You will learn strategies for combining experience with analysis and reflection in writing, managing the writing process, working effectively with sources, and writing persuasively. You will also practice using writing as a tool for exploring as well as communicating your ideas. Particular emphasis will be given to the process of revision as you learn to write to demonstrate competence, develop your ideas, refine your writing, and give feedback to others. The course assumes a basic understanding of English grammar. It carries four tuition credit hours. Note that SNL does not accept transfer courses for the L4 competence; however, students who feel their writing is particularly strong and can provide examples should consider taking the L4 Proficiency Exam to satisfy the L4 Competence.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Nicholas</td><td>Hayes</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>26503</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Nicholas</td><td>Hayes</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>802</td><td>26504</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><td>0.0</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Nicholas</td><td>Hayes</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>803</td><td>26505</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
