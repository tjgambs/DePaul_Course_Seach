Research in second language acquisition (SLA) is multi-disciplinary in nature, reflecting the complexity of language learning and use.  Linguistic, psychological and social processes that underlie language(s) learning and use will be introduced and applied to the understanding of this learning in young children.  In this course, language acquisition theory concerning relationships between early literacy and oral language development in first and subsequent languages will be addressed.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Jennifer</td><td>Mata-McMahon</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>201</td><td>26444</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr>
