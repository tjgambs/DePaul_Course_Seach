In this course, students will learn the varied ways in which scholars interpret the past, focusing particularly on the evidence and arguments used by historians in their work. To that end, students will learn about the varieties of primary sources (textual, material, oral) as well as the varied methods historians use to analyze such evidence. In addition, students will practice analyzing primary source evidence in oral and written presentations, learn how to use the library for historical research, and how to discern scholarly arguments in secondary sources.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/margaret-storey.html">4.34</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/margaret-storey.html">Margaret</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/margaret-storey.html">Storey</a></td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20487</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday, Wednesday</td> </tr><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>Ana</td><td>Schaposchnik</td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>202</td><td>20488</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
