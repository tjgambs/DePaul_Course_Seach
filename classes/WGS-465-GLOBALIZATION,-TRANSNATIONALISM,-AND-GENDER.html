There will be a focus on how gender roles, relationships, and identities are constructed, deployed, challenged, and resisted around the globe, paying particular attention to how systems and structures of gender, race, class, sexuality, age, ability, culture, religion, nation etc. are interconnected.  It will explore how resistance to structural inequities is constructed within and across national boundaries, paying particular attention to the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) worldwide and how the responses of NGOs to crises (e.g., nuclearism, uneven economic development, environmental degradation) highlight the shortcomings of state-centered decision making.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/sanjukta-mukherjee.html">3.5</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/sanjukta-mukherjee.html">Sanjukta</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/sanjukta-mukherjee.html">Mukherjee</a></td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20940</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
