MSW 421 presents the conceptual foundations and methods of research in order to assist students with integrating research knowledge with professional social work practice and ethics. The course focuses on the quantitative and qualitative methods. The course covers the research process from problem identification through the conceptualization of research questions, sampling, design, measurement, data collection, analysis, and dissemination of findings. Additionally the course pays specific attention to ethics in research and issues of race, class, gender and sexual orientation. As an alternative to the quantitative research method, the course touches briefly on qualitative methods. The course makes use of examples and readings that focus on conducting research with individuals, families, and communities in urban environments. Students engage in a critical analysis of the quantitative research method and consider alternative methods of developing knowledge as it pertains to social work. Additionally, the course provides a basic coverage of data analysis using both the quantitative and qualitative research methods with the goal of developing student's conceptual understanding and ability to critically interpret research findings.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/neil-vincent.html">4.65</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/neil-vincent.html">Neil</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/neil-vincent.html">Vincent</a></td><td>6:00 PM</td><td>9:15 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26218</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday</td></tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/neil-vincent.html">4.65</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/neil-vincent.html">Neil</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/neil-vincent.html">Vincent</a></td><td>1:30 PM</td><td>4:40 PM</td><td>202</td><td>21077</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
