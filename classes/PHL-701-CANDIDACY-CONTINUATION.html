Students are required to be registered for either PHL 701: Candidacy Continuation or PHL 799: Candidacy Maintenance each quarter of the academic year until the dissertation has been defended and the degree completed. The latter course, PHL 799, is to be used during quarters when the student is not actively doing dissertation work.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/avery-goldman.html">3.9</a></td><td>Open</td><td>0</td><td><a href = "../teachers/avery-goldman.html">Avery</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/avery-goldman.html">Goldman</a></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>201</td><td>20891</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>&nbsp;</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
