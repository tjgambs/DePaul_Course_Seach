The content of the class is founded on the major concepts and issues of language acquisition, including UG-access, L1-transfer, age effects, and the acquisition of form vs. meaning. The course pays particular attention to empirical second and world language studies at the syntax/semantics interface. Course readings and discussion examine the complexities of the processes involved in acquiring a world language that includes the relation between first and SLA; contrastive and error analysis; interlanguage; the social and cultural influences on SLA; learner variability; learning strategies; and classroom interaction analysis. Issues surrounding second and world language acquisition are discussed and deliberated through university classroom experiences as well as required field experiences (20/15 hours; level 2).<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Closed</td><td>4</td><td>Sung</td><td>Park-Johnson</td><td>5:30 PM</td><td>8:45 PM</td><td>801</td><td>24429</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
