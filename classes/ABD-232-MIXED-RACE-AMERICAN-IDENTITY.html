Since then, people from mixed racial and ethnic backgrounds have advocated for legal recognition of their status as members of more than one racial group. This course explores the transformation of these "interracial intimacies" from a cultural taboo to a source of personal identity. By placing their lives and experiences in the appropriate historical and cultural context, we will explore how people who identify as "mixed" negotiate the rigid boundaries of race in the United States.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/lori-pierce.html">2.3</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/lori-pierce.html">Lori</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/lori-pierce.html">Pierce</a></td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>25981</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
