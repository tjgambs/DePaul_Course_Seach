It presents students with an overview of the intersections between ecology, the social sciences, and the humanities that inform our vision of the rigor and power of interdisciplinary environmental studies. It draws upon the natural sciences, communication, geography, religion, history, literature, art and design, and public policy to stress the interrelationships between human society and the natural world. Students will study the effects of the human use of the natural world and the interactions of culture, society, resources, and the environment. We will examine the social, political, and economic institutions that impact the environment. Particular attention will be paid to how the role of power and inequality contribute to environmental problems and how those problems in turn, impact certain groups more than others (e.g. citizens of undeveloped nations, people of color in urban areas) .<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Barbara</td><td>Willard</td><td>9:40 AM</td><td>11:10 AM</td><td>201</td><td>21684</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr>
