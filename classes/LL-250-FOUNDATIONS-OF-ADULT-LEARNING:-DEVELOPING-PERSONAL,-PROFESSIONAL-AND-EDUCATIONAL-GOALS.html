They master the notion of competence and identify ways of achieving it through prior and future learning. The course includes organizing a portfolio that will be an ongoing resource to support and document students' accomplishment of their learning goals. Students should take this course early in their program so they have a clear pathway to graduation. This course satisfies two competencies: L2 (Foundations) and F1 (Focus Area Planning).<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Betta</td><td>LoSardo</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>801</td><td>23513</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Ann</td><td>Stanford</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>802</td><td>23514</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Akilah</td><td>Martin</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>12:00 AM</td><td>803</td><td>23515</td><td>OnLine</td><td></td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>John</td><td>Kimsey</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>804</td><td>23516</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Susan</td><td>McGury</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>805</td><td>23517</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Ludovic</td><td>Comeau</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>806</td><td>23518</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Thursday</td> </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Arieahn</td><td>Matamonasa-Bennett</td><td>6:15 PM</td><td>9:30 PM</td><td>807</td><td>23519</td><td>Naperville Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
