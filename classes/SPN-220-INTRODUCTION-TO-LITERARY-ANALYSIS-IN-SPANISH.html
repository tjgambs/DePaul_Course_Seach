Students will read and discuss a variety of poems, short stories, and plays, focusing on their various levels of meaning and also on the various ways by which they (or their authors or their readers) create meaning. Other aims of the course include helping students improve their oral and written communication in Spanish, introducing them to research methods in literary studies, and familiarizing them with the MLA style for documenting sources. SPN 106 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/glen-carman.html">3.3</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/glen-carman.html">Glen</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/glen-carman.html">Carman</a></td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20719</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
