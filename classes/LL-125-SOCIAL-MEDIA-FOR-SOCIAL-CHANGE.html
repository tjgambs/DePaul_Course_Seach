Others already have. Let's see what's been done and take action for our own communities. #SMSCsnl

Trending topics on Twitter and other social media sites might seem short lived, but the effectiveness of movements like the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matters illustrate how social media can be used to raise social consciousness and enact social change. Activists, politicians, and concerned individuals increasingly utilize social media tools to facilitate social and political change. 

In this class, we will explore contemporary civic engagement as it happens on social media. We will look at how social media facilitates messages and organization of different social movements. We will analyze how these movements have been effective and how they have been ineffective. Ultimately, we will design and implement a social media plan to raise social awareness for a social issue emerging from our own communities<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><td>0.0</td><td>2</td><td>Nicholas</td><td>Hayes</td><td>5:45 PM</td><td>9:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>26950</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
