While the impact of a European presence helps define the boundaries of this course, artistic response to that presence is but one theme.  Interactions between African cultures and the impact of Islam are equally important considerations.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Staff</td><td>Staff</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>26087</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr>
