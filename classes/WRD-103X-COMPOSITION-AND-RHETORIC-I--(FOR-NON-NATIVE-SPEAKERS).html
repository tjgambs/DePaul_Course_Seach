Emphasis on audience analysis, rhetorical stance, and the nature of the composing process.  These sections are specifically designed for students whose first or dominant language is not English. Students will have the opportunity to focus on writing challenges that are unique to writing in a second or additional language, including increased attention to language skills and to the cultural expectations of U.S. academic audiences. The lower enrollment capacity of this section will allow for greater attention to students' individual writing needs. These sections address the same course objectives all WRD 103 sections.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-lazio.html">4.2</a></td><td>Open</td><td>4</td><td>20217</td><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-lazio.html">Mark</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/mark-lazio.html">Lazio</a></td><td>1:30 PM</td><td>3:00 PM</td><td>501</td><td>20217</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Tuesday, Thursday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
