This course covers all the material of Spanish 104, but it offers students the unique opportunity to enhance knowledge of the Spanish-speaking world both INSIDE and OUTSIDE the classroom. Students will spend 25 hours per quarter (3 hours/per week) working with one of several organizations in Chicago's Latino communities. These sites mostly serve new immigrants from Mexico and Central America who are in the process of integrating into new cultural environments. By participating in a language exchange on a weekly basis the student will be an active learner and teacher. SPN 104 or 124 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td>4</td><td>Carolina</td><td>Barrera-Tobon</td><td>11:20 AM</td><td>12:50 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20710</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Tuesday,Thursday</td> </tr>
