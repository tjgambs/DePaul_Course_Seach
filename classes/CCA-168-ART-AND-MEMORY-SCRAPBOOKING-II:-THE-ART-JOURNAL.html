This course focuses on a specific aspect of the scrapbooker's art, the production of embellished personal diaries.  Throughout this experience, students will critically examine the artistic aspects of journaling and collage artwork, investigate movements in the art world, chronicle events in their lives through photographs and narrative, and create works of art and craft that illustrate the experience. This is a hands on art making course.  While faculty will discuss various techniques and information about assessing works of art and  putting them in the context of art movements, students should expect to be introduced to art making materials and to use them during class time.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter"><thead><tr><th>Overall Rating</th><th>Class Status</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tbody><td>N/A</td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td>Pamela</td><td>Sandy</td><td>9:00 AM</td><td>4:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>26988</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Saturday</td> </tr><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/betta-losardo.html">2.0</a></td><td>Open</td><td>2</td><td><a href = "../teachers/betta-losardo.html">Betta</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/betta-losardo.html">LoSardo</a></td><td>9:00 AM</td><td>4:00 PM</td><td>801</td><td>26988</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Saturday</td> </tr></tbody></table></body></html>
