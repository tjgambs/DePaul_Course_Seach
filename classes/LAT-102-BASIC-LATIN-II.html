It introduces students to the basics of the language of the Romans, which includes the Latin alphabet, pronunciation and the beginnings of Latin grammar. Students will begin to develop reading and writing skills as they encounter small passages of Latin text, the standard method for learning this ancient tongue being partly memorization and partly language immersion. Students will be expected to read through small passages of Latin, but not without assistance. This course focuses primarily on syntax, grammar and memorization of paradigms, yet students also translate Latin as they proceed, learning rudiments of the language as well as cultural aspects of the Romans at varying epochs.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/joseph-latham.html">4.8</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/joseph-latham.html">Joseph</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/joseph-latham.html">Latham</a></td><td>1:00 PM</td><td>2:30 PM</td><td>201</td><td>20534</td><td>Lincoln Park Campus</td><td>Monday,Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
