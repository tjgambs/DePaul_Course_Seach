These meetings allow students the exciting and rare opportunity to engage in personalized, in-depth conversations with leaders in government, CEOs and senior executives from for-profit corporations, and directors of nonprofit organizations.  The meetings take place at the leader's place of business and will allow for an informal discussion with individuals otherwise known to students only through the media and at a distance.    Students learn first-hand from the experiences of these extraordinary success stories so that they can glean the critical elements necessary for successful and ethical leadership.  In-class sessions will involve briefings on key issues facing the leaders, analysis of risk assessment and management, and critical review of leadership decision-making.  The course is designed to serve both those students who are interested in leading their own entrepreneurial ventures, as well as those who seek leadership roles in larger corporations or other organizations.<h2>Available Classes</h2><table class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>RMP Overall</th><th>Credit Hours</th><th>Teacher First Name</th><th>Teacher Last Name</th><th>Class Start Time</th><th>Class End Time</th><th>Class Section</th><th>Class Number</th><th>Location</th><th>Days</th> </tr></thead><tr><td><a href = "../teachers/kelly-pope.html">3.4</a></td><td>4</td><td><a href = "../teachers/kelly-pope.html">Kelly</a></td><td><a href = "../teachers/kelly-pope.html">Pope</a></td><td>8:30 AM</td><td>11:45 AM</td><td>201</td><td>26745</td><td>Loop Campus</td><td>Wednesday</td> </tr></table></body></html>
