Together, we will carefully analyze a wide variety of films with the goal of critically examining their representations of race, gender, class and their depiction of agency of their subjects. We will also examine the storytelling and technical techniques used by filmmakers and how those techniques support the goals of filmmakers. Finally, we will examine case studies of activists who are using film and film-making as a part of movements for social justice. Students will leave this course with a better understanding of the ethics of filmmaking and the use of film in social movements. They will be more critical consumers of media and more familiar with a variety of social justice issues.
