"UIP 250 YOU, YOUR WORK AND THE WORLD"
"UIP 250 integrates academic curriculum with supervised work experiences in both the private and public sectors. Internships are an essential part of a student's academic experience at DePaul. The course promotes the life-long education process of integrating work and learning; enables students to view their internship experiences within a broad world perspective; assists career decision-making; drives individual success through on-the-job experiences; and provides students with valuable networking and other career-development opportunities. 

The course includes 5 2-hour classroom meetings and ongoing D2L discussions. Some sections of UIP 250 are completely online. All of our 4-credit UIP courses fulfill the JYEL learning requirement. If you have completed the requirement already, the course will be counted as a general elective course."
