DCM 309 APPLIED RESEARCH
"This course allows the student to develop competence in the process of systematic, academic inquiry. The Applied Research course requirements focus on key aspects of inquiry. Students create a research proposal responding to a purpose, problem, and question each chooses to target (but do not actually carry out the data collection or analysis during this particular quarter).  Students will explore research methodologies""quantitative and qualitative"" and create a research design proposal based on a literature review and carefully constructed question, hypothesis, and methodology."
