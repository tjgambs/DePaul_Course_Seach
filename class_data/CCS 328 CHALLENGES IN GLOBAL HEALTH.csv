CCS 328 CHALLENGES IN GLOBAL HEALTH
"In 1967 the United States Surgeon General announced that it was ""time to close the book on infectious disease"". Antibiotics had been introduced in the 1940's, there was an ever-lengthening list of diseases for which immunization was available, and many world health officials imagined a future free of infectious diseases. Yet, as we begin the twenty-first century, infectious diseases are still the leading cause of death in the world. Why? How do we begin to understand the emergence of AIDS, Ebola virus, Lyme disease or Hantavirus? How can we explain the worldwide reemergence of tuberculosis, a disease that had come close to being relegated to history books? In this online course we will seek answers as we study the nature of microbes and the complex, often interrelated factors that contribute to their ability to challenge us even as we pit our science and technologies against them. We will examine such factors as population growth, urbanization, ecological disruption, human migration and antibiotic misuse. In 1996 the Director-General of the World Health Organization announced, ""We stand on the brink of a global crisis in infectious diseases."" Clearly the book on infectious disease is still wide open, and we will read some of its pages."
