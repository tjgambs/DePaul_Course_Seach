"HST 113 THE WORLD, 1900-PRESENT"
"More change -- political, economic, social, technological -- occurred in the 20th Century than in all the previous years of human history combined. The world at end of the century, in 2001, was nothing like the world that our great-great-grandparents were born into just 100 years before. And, unlike previous eras, what happened on one place impacted everyone everywhere on earth. Why and how did such vast changes occur, and why did they happen so quickly? These are some of the themes that History 113 will address."
