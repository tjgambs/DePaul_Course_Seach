PPS 301 PUBLIC POLICY AND THE POLITICAL PROCESS
"Policy decisions almost inevitably involve politics. This core course explores the politics of the urban political machines that dominated politics in many cities for a long time, though some might argue that thay actually had few policy interests other than to remain in power. The course examines how power is distributed in cities, and how it is used to get at the various problems confronting cities. That is, how politics affects policy. The course studies the players in the game of policy formation, and the policy process itself. While the focus may be on cities, make no mistake, politics impacts environmental policy decisions and the process of making those decisions as well."
