Part of this instruction is to give students an understanding of how writing for broadcast differs from writing for print and the awareness it takes to write copy that supports and strengthens the visuals that viewers will be watching. Strong writing is the backbone of broadcast journalism, and this course gives students a firm foundation in the writing skills that produce broadcast stories worth watching."
