UIP 254 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
"Students will examine their own internship experiences, along with real world case studies, research, and commentary, to learn about the critical decision-making processes organizations address as they balance competitive advantages against the weight of social progress. This is an online course.  Students are required to work at least 100 hours during the quarter in which they are enrolled in the class. Attendance at an internship orientation is required. All of our 4-credit UIP courses fulfill the JYEL learning requirement. If you have completed the requirement already, the course will be counted as a general elective course."
