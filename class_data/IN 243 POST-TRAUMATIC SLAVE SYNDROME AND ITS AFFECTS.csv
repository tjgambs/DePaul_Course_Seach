IN 243 POST-TRAUMATIC SLAVE SYNDROME AND ITS AFFECTS
"This FDIS seeks to inform students about the nature of trauma, and the impact of post-traumatic slave syndrome (PTSS) on African-American life and culture. In the context of this course, both of these phenomena are associated with 250 years of U.S. chattel slavery, followed by decades of de jure and de facto racial discrimination. It is a subject that has historical, psychological and sociological implications and thus is a must for students pursuing undergraduate and/or graduate work in these areas. With this primary goal in mind, students will be asked to review one of two texts on the subject, Joy DeGruy-Leary's Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome: America's Legacy of Enduring Inquiry and Healing or Thom Burrell's Brainwashed: Challenging the Myth of Black Inferiority, along with selected readings where appropriate."
