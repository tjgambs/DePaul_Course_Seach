LL 201 DISCOVER NEW LEARNING
"In this introductory theme-based course, students will use a variety of focused, active and engaging learning experiences as a basis for deriving meaning from experience.  Depending on the theme or subject matter of the course, these learning experiences might include textual analysis, musical or theatrical presentations, films, visits to Chicago-area museums or other institutions, guest speakers, community service or hands-on scientific work.  In each case, the learning experiences will serve as a foundation for asking critical questions, analysis, reflection and meaning-making.  The class will also familiarize students with the necessary skills and habits as well as available resources to help them become academically successful."
