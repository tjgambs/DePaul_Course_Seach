NSG 376 COMMUNITY HEALTH NURSING FOR THE PROFESSIONAL NURSE
"The emphasis of this course is on the delivery of comprehensive, culturally appropriate services to meet the continuing health needs of families, aggregates, and communities. Students will design population-focused nursing interventions to reduce assessed risk, incidence, and prevalence of community health problems. The role of the community health nurse in health promotion, disease, and injury prevention and management across the lifespan is examined, specifically across the continuum of care and coordination of services at the individual and population levels.  Emphasis is placed on current trends and professional, legal/ethical, economic, cultural, and environmental issues as they apply to community health nursing."
