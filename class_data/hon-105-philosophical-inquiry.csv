HON 105 PHILOSOPHICAL INQUIRY
"Providing an introduction to philosophy as a mode of inquiry, this course explores, from a variety of perspectives, the questions central to the human condition, placing philosophical positions within the context of human values.  Students will address the themes of knowledge, action, and human identity, considering how one thinks critically about such questions and what it means to inquire about the human condition in a rational manner. Readings will be drawn from both primary philosophical texts and relevant material from other disciplines."
