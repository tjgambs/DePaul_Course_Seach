PPS 206 QUANTITATIVE PUBLIC POLICY ANALYSIS
"This course focuses on writing of research questions and hypotheses, selection of appropriate quantitative statistical analyses for research questions, interpretation of statistical results, and communication of those results. A significant portion of the course work will involve doing statistical analyses of existing data using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) in the computer lab. Students will prepare a substantial paper using the techniques for public policy analysis learned in class. Students majoring in PPS are strongly encouraged to have completed PPS 205 before taking this course. This core course for PPS majors and minors should be taken before the senior year. Formerly PPS 204."
