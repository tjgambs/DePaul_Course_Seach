NSG 700 ADVANCED PRACTICUM FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS I
"First of a series of two clinical courses that focus on developing proficiency in advanced nursing assessment and management for health promotion and disease prevention, management of complex health conditions, and working with interdisciplinary teams to provide care and services for persons across the lifespan. Students will ground their studies in the science of nursing interventions, moral/ethical issues, and nursing research. Practicum experiences are arranged to meet the individual needs of students while also meeting accreditation and certification requirements.  This practicum provides an in-depth clinical experience for students in assessing an aggregate population within the context of a clinical setting, and developing programs to creatively and cost effectively affect changes in health care delivery. The clinical residency experience is facilitated by an advanced practice expert clinician, and forms the setting and basis for the Scholarly Leadership Project. There is no lecture/discussion component to this course. The student will meet with his/her course instructor on a regular basis for individual discussion and guidance in this Practicum course."
