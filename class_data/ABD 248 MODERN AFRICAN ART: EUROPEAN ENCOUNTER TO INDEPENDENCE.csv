ABD 248 MODERN AFRICAN ART: EUROPEAN ENCOUNTER TO INDEPENDENCE
"This course surveys a selection of artistic traditions from across the African continent beginning with the arrival of the Portuguese along the coast of West Africa in the mid-fifteenth century until the age of African independence in the 1960s.  While the impact of a European presence helps define the boundaries of this course, artistic response to that presence is but one theme.  Interactions between African cultures and the impact of Islam are equally important considerations. Cross-listed as HAA 202."
