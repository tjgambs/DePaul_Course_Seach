"HC 165 CHINA: MONEY, POWER AND THE 21ST CENTURY"
"The greatest migration of people in the history of the world is occurring right now, in China. Hundreds of millions of people, whose families have lived in rural China for thousands of years, are moving to rapidly urbanizing cities. This course analyzes, through the voices of the Chinese people, the dramatic impact of this social and economic revolution upon families and individuals. These changes are having a worldwide impact upon economics, trade and the new world order. Through lecture/discussions, videos, readings, on-line discussion boards and independent research, students will have the opportunity to form their own viewpoints as to the impact of globalization upon one of the oldest civilizations on earth."
