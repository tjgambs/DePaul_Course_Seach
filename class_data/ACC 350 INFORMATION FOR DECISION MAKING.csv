ACC 350 INFORMATION FOR DECISION MAKING
"Information for Decision-Making is typically the final course in the curriculum in Accountancy.  It is the course in the program that most emphasizes research using the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and documenting research results.  There is also a focus on written and oral communication as well as teamwork.  More specifically, the course addresses the standard setting process in financial accounting as well as the role that the Securities and Exchange Commission fills in that process.  In addition, current financial accounting topics are covered including revenue recognition, fair value measurement and disclosures, and earnings quality.  The course also provides an introduction to International Financial Reporting Standards."
