JOUR 343 JOURNALISM AND THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE
"This seminar analyzes the current condition of American print, broadcast and online journalism in light of their historic past. Journalism's social responsibilities and its functioning as a business are examined across major periods of American history-the colonial and revolutionary press, the early Republican and penny press, the Civil War press and the press of industrializing America, the rise of the tabloid press, and the role of the press in reporting the development of the United States as a world power during World War II and in its aftermath-will be captured."
