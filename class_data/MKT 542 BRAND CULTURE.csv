MKT 542 BRAND CULTURE
"Brands are complex socio-cultural entities. They occupy a unique position in modern culture and consumers are increasingly playing a more prominent role in the legacies of brands. Despite these realities, the complex relationship between brands, consumers and culture has typically been ignored. This seminar class will explore the culture of brands, focusing on what consumers do with and to brands instead of what brands do to consumers. Readings will come from a variety of perspectives, including both practitioner and academic sources.  Topics covered will include: Sociological aspects of consumers and their brands, brands and status systems, brand and consumption communities, and consumer created marketing content. This class is designed to give you an advantage in being the best brand manager. It will stress critical thinking, creativity, synthesis and application of the newest insights concerning brands. Students will emerge with a better understanding of how to engage in the practice of cultural branding."
