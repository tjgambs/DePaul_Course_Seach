"MOL 402 LANGUAGE, SELF AND SOCIETY"
"This course offers students a theoretical and methodological introduction to the theory and methods of the study of language variation and change and its relationship to various social and individual factors (e.g. race, class, sex, ethnicity, identity, etc.). It introduces students to the concepts, theories, and methods used to analyze language and its role in the definition and construction of individual and group identity. Students will look specifically at how social and individual factors may influence linguistic structure and vice versa. The course will explore various theories of sociolinguistics, including the interaction between language and speakers' membership in various groups, linguistic variation across groups, intergroup theory, dialectology, and discourse analysis, among others. Through the course readings students will consider and critically analyze the notions of the speech community and the individual, the existence (or not) of dialects, synchronic variation and diachronic change, the relationship between social factors and language, language policy and planning, language standardization, linguistic ethnography, and theories related to education and society. Bilingual phenomena such as code switching, language contact, and the creation of pidgins and creoles will also be examined. Topics may vary by quarter. This course is required for language MA students."
