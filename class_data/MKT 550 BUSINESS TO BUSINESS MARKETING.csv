MKT 550 BUSINESS TO BUSINESS MARKETING
"The marketing of business goods and services to other businesses (B:B) is more significant in our economy than consumer marketing and is the key to the continued success and productivity of the U.S. economy.  In this course, the principles and practices of inter-industry marketing will be explored by case analysis.  The factors which must be considered before establishing marketing programs manufacturers, service industries and exporters will be examined.  Examples will be drawn from varied industries, including equipment, electronics, computer systems, health care and others.  New product introduction, distribution, and other marketing strategies will be emphasized."
