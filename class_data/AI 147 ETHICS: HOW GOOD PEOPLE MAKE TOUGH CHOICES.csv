AI 147 ETHICS: HOW GOOD PEOPLE MAKE TOUGH CHOICES
"Through life's many lessons, we have learned how to make a decision between what is the right thing to do and what is simply wrong.  We can differentiate between good and evil, truth and lies, etc.  However, most of our dilemmas do not stem from deciding the correct path, when we are faced with right and wrong decisions.  What most often puts us into a quandary is deciding between what is right and what is right.  In other words when good people are faced with tough choices, on what basis do they make their decisions?  In an era of perceived ethical incertitude and moral skepticism, students will examine how decisions are made based on one of many ethical systems.  Students will learn about various ethical systems, and ethicists, such as utilitarianism, deontology, Kant, Aristotle, and Gillian, just to name a few.  By the end of the course students should be able to apply their knowledge of moral, ethical and social issues, and have a better understanding of how the tough decisions they make could impact others."
