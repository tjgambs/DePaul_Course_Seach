HC 178 GENDER AT WORK
"From the days of hunters and gatherers our world has been organized by gender expectations.  While these gender roles have evolved over time, women and men today still struggle to meet these expectations and they have largely defined who we are for centuries.  We have more choices and freedom to renegotiate and transcend these roles now than at any other time in history, and yet they still impact every aspect of our lives.   This course will explore how gender can influence communication patterns, leadership styles, negotiation skills, conflict styles, work/life balance expectations, relationships and a multitude of other aspects of our life at work and at home. Students will demonstrate the competencies through class participation, group projects, journal entries and other assignments that will allow them to apply course readings, films, and discussion to their own personal experience."
