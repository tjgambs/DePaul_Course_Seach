LLS 440 VALUES EFECTIVENESS
"This domain includes the ability to recognize and analyze one?s values and those of others in order to find effective ways to translate beliefs into effective action. When individuals expand awareness of their own choices and recognize the choices of others, they can live their own lives more effectively and successfully mediate conflicts with others. Central questions include: What should I do in this situation? Why did he/she/they decide to do things that way when it seems so clearly wrong to me? Seminar sections in this domain might address topics such as ethical reasoning, decision-making, values-clarification, priority setting, courage in action, etc."
