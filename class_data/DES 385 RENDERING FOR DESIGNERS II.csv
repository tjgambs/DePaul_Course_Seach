DES 385 RENDERING FOR DESIGNERS II
"Second course in a 3 course sequence.  The course consists of exercises, studies and renderings using values of gray to achieve the illusion of 3- dimensional form. With a variety of drawing and painting materials, students work from gradually more complex still-life set ups, under controlled lighting, and form a clipping file of research which they compile."
