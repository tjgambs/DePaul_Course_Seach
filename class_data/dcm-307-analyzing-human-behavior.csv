DCM 307 ANALYZING HUMAN BEHAVIOR
"This course targets the link between the physical environment and social behavior. Every physical space is also a social space; its organization contains a ""code"" of responsive behavior for people to understand. We focus on these ""codes,"" and examine the ways they provoke conformity and deviance from individuals and groups. Students are expected to enter the social environment and gather publicly-observable data for analysis in the classroom setting. The ethics of social research, and of an observer's interaction with the environment, are key points of inquiry during the quarter. Students in this course work at a ""pre-ethnography"" level, and are primed by its conclusion to enter and analyze any social group and its physical surroundings."
