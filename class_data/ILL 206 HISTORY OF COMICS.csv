ILL 206 HISTORY OF COMICS
"This course will cover the history of the art form collectively known as ""comics"" --mechanically reproduced graphic storytelling--which includes comic strips, comic books, graphic novels, Japanese manga and online comics. Students will be introduced to the evolution of the art form from 18th century precursors, to late 19th century newspaper pages, to the 20th century comic book, through today's sophisticated graphic novels. The course will devote considerable time to comics of other cultures, with special emphasis on Japan and Europe. It will also examine the relationship of comics to culture at large, and the struggle of underground and alternative comic artists to explore adult subjects such as politics and gender."
