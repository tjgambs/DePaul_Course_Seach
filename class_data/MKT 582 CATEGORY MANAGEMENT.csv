MKT 582 CATEGORY MANAGEMENT
"Category management is the practice of managing a group of products as one entity, or category to maximize the return for a particular retailer, as it relates to shelf inventory, shelf position, consumer shopping patterns and promotion. The course provides the analytical framework necessary to conduct a category review and make strategic recommendations to both manufacturers and retailers.  The Department of Marketing partners with a number of major consumer packaged goods (CPG) manufacturers and retailers who provide data for analysis.  In addition to working on real data, students learn how to use advanced software such as Nielsen's Category Business Planner, Homescan, InfiNet and Spaceman."
