TCH 481 TEACHING ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 2
"This course continues students' immersion into the pedagogical content knowledge development and practices that began in TCH 421 and TCH 471. The course provides students opportunities to continue to explore and develop research-based and theoretically grounded best practices in the teaching of reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills and sensibilities, with an emphasis on reflective and collaborative practice.  The course provides extensive opportunities for planning, using, and evaluating a variety of instructional strategies, including the use of technology resources, through teaching demonstrations and modeling and field experiences. Students will fine-tune and reflect on writing instructional objectives, developing lesson plans, designing a curriculum unit, creating a classroom environment, and implementing instructional delivery strategies and methods that meet the needs of diverse learners, including English language learners and students who speak nonmainstream dialects of English. And like in TCH 471, students will reflect on and clearly articulate orally, in writing, and through practice an educational philosophy and theory. Students will also demonstrate commitment to teaching as a professional who acts responsibly, ethically, and collegially in accordance to Vincentian personalism.  30 Level 2 Field Experience hours required. COREQUISITE(S): Taken concurrently with TCH 451 or SCG 451. Offered during Winter term."
