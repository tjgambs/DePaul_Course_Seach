"INT 408 NATURE, SOCIETY, AND POWER"
"This course is an interdisciplinary exploration of environmental issues pertinent to international studies. The reproduction of human societies occurs in a symbiotic relationship with the natural world, yet in the modern era nature has come to be increasingly conceptualized as a resource. This course explores the repercussions of this instrumental separation of nature from culture and society. Our conceptions of nature range from the physical environment to the human body; and the course explores a range of related political, economic, ecological, and socio-cultural issues from theoretical, comparative, and practical perspectives. Issues explored include those of environmental justice and social and political equity, and questions such as who defines what constitutes environmental issues, who is included or excluded from environmental concerns, and who benefits or is harmed by environmental changes occurring as a result of social interventions."
