WRD 205 HISTORY OF LITERACIES AND WRITING
"Literacy is traditionally defined as the ability to read and write. This course will expand that definition to also explore the technological, cultural, and political aspects of literacy from the earliest archeological record of writing to modern information technology and digital literacy. Students will examine practices and narratives surrounding literacy, learn how both physical media and social power constrain what information gets recorded and how, and question the implications of these constraints on the ways we define and engage literacy and writing."
