ENV 216 EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
"This course focuses on three of the great spheres of the Earth (lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere) and how they interact with the biosphere to create an integrated Earth system with an emphasis on how human activities impact important earth system cycles. Students should have a basic understanding of how living organisms interact with their physical environment. Laboratory activities provide experience with the tools and methodology of systems thinking."
