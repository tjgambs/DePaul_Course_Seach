SEC 325 LITERACY IN THE CONTENT AREAS
"The course explores the interrelationships between reading, writing, and other forms of communication (e.g., classroom talk, technology, visual arts) that are available to content area middle-level and high-school teachers. There will be an emphasis on the interrelationship of all aspects of language, oral and written, that result in literacy as a meaning-making tool in the construction of content-area knowledge. The course will discuss specific aspects of literacy processes from a multicultural, multilingual perspective as they apply to a variety of school settings in general and urban schools in particular. Students will become acquainted with theoretical issues as well as a wide range of literacy-teaching strategies including reading, writing, research, and study skills to be tailored to the needs of different students and to be applied across a variety of learning situations and text types. 30 Level 2 Field Experience hours."
