ACC 637 DATA MINING AND ANALYTICS
"The course will cover basic concepts, terminology, models and methods in the field of data mining. The auditing profession seeks to move toward CAATs, continuous auditing and continuous monitoring, which cover all or a large population of transactions rather than very limited sample sizes. The skills taught include data mining techniques such as traditional statistical analysis and machine learning. This course will illustrate the knowledge discovery process and how the technology works with sample applications of data mining. Students will analyze large datasets and develop modeling solutions to support decision making in accounting."
