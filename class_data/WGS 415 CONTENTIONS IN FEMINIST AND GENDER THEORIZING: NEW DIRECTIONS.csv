WGS 415 CONTENTIONS IN FEMINIST AND GENDER THEORIZING: NEW DIRECTIONS
"This course addresses different aspects of feminist and gender theorizing and their interrelationships, focusing on exploration and critical examination of controversies and debates in the field.  The course content engages students in examining philosophical, ideological, social, political, and cultural fault lines that offer opportunities to deepen and extend our understandings about discourses on women's and gender studies constructions and negotiations, in the late 20th century as well as in the early 21st century.  The lens through which particular issues and ideas are viewed draws upon multiple perspectives, taking into consideration issues of culture and context, grounded in examining specificities of the local in relationship to global or transnational dynamics."
