This advanced practicum provides the student with the opportunity to link policy making with clinical systems, translate research into practice, and serve as change agents for health care. In addition, this course provides the student with an opportunity to demonstrate expert knowledge, and expert clinical assessment and diagnostic skills when working with various patient populations. This practicum provides an in-depth clinical experience for students in assessing an aggregate population within the context of a clinical setting, and developing programs to creatively and cost effectively affect changes in health care delivery, and to evaluate those programs. The clinical residency experience is facilitated by an advanced practice expert clinician, and forms the setting and basis for the Scholarly Leadership Project. There is no lecture/discussion component to this course. The student will meet with his/her course instructor on a regular basis for individual discussion and guidance in this Practicum course."
