ECO 508 RESEARCH METHODS FOR POLICY ANALYSIS II
"This course focuses on advanced techniques used to statistically analyze economic data.  We will focus on both theoretical understanding (why do we use such tools and how do they work) and applied understanding (the ability to carry on a research project using these tools).  Topics to be covered include the analysis of time series and panel data, discrete choice models, simultaneous equations, forecasting and experimental methods.  Students will learn statistical Stata commands that apply to the advanced topics covered."
