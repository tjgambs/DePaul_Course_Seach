SW 269 ENERGY AND HEALTH
"This course will provide a framework for understanding human energy systems, such as digestion and respiration, in relation to current healthcare practices to enhance their effectiveness (dietary approach, manipulation therapies, acupuncture, exercise, and meditation).  We will consider connections between social and environmental variables such as constitution, stress, lifestyle, and vital physiological functions.  Each class will build on the basic understanding of biological systems in relation to energy through lecture and discussion.  We will review literature on various healthcare practices to discern sound approaches and practical applications.  Students will cultivate an appreciation for daily health choices that cumulatively affect their health."
