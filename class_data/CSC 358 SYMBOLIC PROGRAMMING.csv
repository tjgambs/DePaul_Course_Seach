"Concepts of symbolic programming as embodied in the language LISP.  Basic data and control structures of LISP: symbolic expressions, the interpreter, functions, recursion, iteration.  Techniques for prototyping and building conceptually advanced systems in an environment that encourages procedural and data abstraction.

Assignments will focus on basic AI techniques, but the class is intended for anyone who will need to rapidly develop large complex systems.  PREREQUISITE(S): CSC 301 or CSC 383 or CSC 393."
