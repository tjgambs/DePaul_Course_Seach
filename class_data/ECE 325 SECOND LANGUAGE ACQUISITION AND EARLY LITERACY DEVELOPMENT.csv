ECE 325 SECOND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND EARLY LITERACY DEVELOPMENT
"This course will examine the process of learning and using a second language. Research in second language acquisition (SLA) is multi-disciplinary in nature, reflecting the complexity of language learning and use.  Linguistic, psychological and social processes that underlie language learning and use will be introduced and applied to the understanding of this learning in young children.  Language acquisition theory concerning relationships between early literacy and oral language development in first and subsequent languages will be explored.  Understanding developed through this exploration will then be applied to the classroom in the form of strategies and literacy development activities."
