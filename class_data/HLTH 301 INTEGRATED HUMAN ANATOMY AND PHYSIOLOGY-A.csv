HLTH 301 INTEGRATED HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY-A
"This course explores the fundamental principles of human anatomy and physiology that specifically relate to the sensation and perception of environmental stimuli, as well as the response to such challenges. In this context, broad consideration will be given to the body's various modes of cellular and tissue communication, with special emphasis on the interplay between the integumentary, skeletomuscular, nervous, and endocrine systems. In addition, the integrated approach will provide a strong foundation for the serial investigation of relevant topics relating to human health and disease, and clinical intervention."
