ECO 310 URBAN ECONOMICS
"This course discusses the economic rationale for the existence of cities and urban areas.  Location decision-making by both firms and households is analyzed with attention given to the resulting land values, land rents, population density gradients, and urban land use patterns.  We study models of the supply and demand for housing, the measurement and determination of house value, and the corresponding problems of segregation, housing abandonment, property taxation, and public housing.  Other urban problems such as poverty, crime, and transportation are also discussed."
