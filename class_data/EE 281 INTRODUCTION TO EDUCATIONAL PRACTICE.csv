EE 281 INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE
"This is the first in a sequence of theory and practice courses that serves to familiarize teaching candidates with the world of elementary and middle schools.  Through observation and participation in schools, self-reflection, independently created assignments, cooperative learning assignments and classroom discussion, candidates will acquire familiarity with schools and classrooms including: social/cultural context, classroom climate, classroom management, curricular coherence, standards-based instruction, and teacher professional beliefs and practices.  Written critical reflections and papers serve as initial foundation for the development of teaching philosophies.  Required field experiences are integrated into this course."
