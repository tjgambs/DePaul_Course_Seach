SPN 203 ADVANCED CONVERSATION
"This course will focus on improving the student's oral skills in Spanish through intensive practice. Students will discuss a wide range of topics, and they will practice conversational strategies for a variety of situations. Upon completing this course, students should be able to do the following: 1) talk about the past in a coherent and fairly detailed manner; 2) deal effectively with unanticipated complications (e.g., a lost ticket); 3) adapt to formal and informal situations; 4) speak broadly on topics of personal interest; and 5) make themselves easily understood by Spanish speakers who are unaccustomed to dealing with non-native speakers. Class preparation will include readings (from various genres) and films. SPN 106 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended."
