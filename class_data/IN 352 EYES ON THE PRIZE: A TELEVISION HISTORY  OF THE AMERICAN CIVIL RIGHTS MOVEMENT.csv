IN 352 EYES ON THE PRIZE: A TELEVISION HISTORY  OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
"The American Civil Rights Movement was one of the most profound social movements in U.S. history.  It significantly altered the nation's social structure and self-understanding and liberated a people from disenfranchisement.  This course looks at the high points along the road to social justice for African-Americans and the associated changes that resulted in the legal, social, economic, and political systems of the land.  Students will trace key developments from the 1954 Supreme Court ruling that integrated schools to our current racial situation by watching the award-winning PBS series and reading a significant book on the topic."
