LST 203 MEDIA AND CULTURAL STUDIES ACROSS THE AMERICAS
"LST 203 is an introduction to media and cultural studies with a specific focus on cultural transactions in the American hemisphere, particularly as they reflect the relationship of the U.S. to Latin America, Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. This course studies the history of national and cultural identities and social struggle, especially with regard to a north/south relationship, imperialism, revolution and social change, tourism, globalization, postcolonialism and the construction of gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity. Students examine how relationships across the Americas have been depicted in popular culture and the social and political meanings of these representations."
