SEC 311 THE NATURE OF ENGLISH
"This course is designed to help students to see that the field of English Studies is bigger than the component they probably identify as English (its Literature, Writing, and Linguistics/Grammar). Students will explore the formation of the discipline up to the current day, focusing on the shifting understanding of ways of reading, writing and thinking about language. They will strive to answer the questions: What does it mean to be a student of language and literature? and, What are the ways of knowing writing, literature, and language? In doing so, students will relate their disciplinary content to their daily lives and interests and to the larger framework of human endeavor and understanding, including identifying its importance to the personal lives of high school students."
