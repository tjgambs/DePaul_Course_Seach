MGT 302 ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR
"This course focuses on the nature and consequences of human behavior in organizations. The prediction, explanation and management of individual and group behavior in the organization is dependent upon an understanding of the concepts of organizational behavior. Classroom experiences will focus on both understanding and practicing these concepts. Topics cover both the individual level - e.g. perception, attitudes, motivation - and the group level - e.g. leadership, group dynamics, communication, power and politics, and decision making."
