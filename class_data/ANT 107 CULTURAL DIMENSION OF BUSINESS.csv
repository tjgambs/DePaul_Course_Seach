ANT 107 CULTURAL DIMENSION OF BUSINESS
"The focus of the course revolves around this question: What difference does it make when people who participate in different systems of meaning-making buy and sell goods and services to each other? We do not have to juxtapose buyers and sellers from the ends of the earth to see the implications of this question. Even within our own society there are cultural boundaries between buyers and sellers that we can observe. Through the readings and discussions, this course will explore these grey areas of business in cross-cultural environments."
