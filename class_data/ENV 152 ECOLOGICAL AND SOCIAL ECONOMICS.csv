ENV 152 ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL ECONOMICS
"In this course, students examine the role of the environment and natural resources in neoclassical, environmental and ecological economics. First, students study mechanisms for efficiently allocating scarce resources among specific alternative ends and take a brief foray into environmental economics and learn methods of resource/environmental valuation. We also discuss aspects of macroeconomics as it pertains to ecological economics. Students come away able to critically assess the benefits and drawbacks of these three ways that the economy incorporates the environment. It also encourages ethical reasoning as we discuss distribution of environmental benefits over generations and globally."
