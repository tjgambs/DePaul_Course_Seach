AI 197 WHAT WAS GOD THINKING WHEN HE INVENTED THE UNIVERSE
"We are all made of star dust.  Find out how and why in this course.  The moon is made up fragments of earth.  Learn how we depend on each other.  All life has been wiped out at least 6 times on this planet.  Find out if God really likes us.  We humans have only been around for 100,000 years, but we are rearranging our planet big time.  Figure out if we know what we are doing."
