UIP 350 NAVIGATING THE CHANGING WORKPLACE
"UIP 350 is an online course, where students use their current work experience to examine and report on key issues impacting their organizations and personal work lives.  Students will study internal and external factors affecting their work environment, traditional and virtual work arrangements, the increased influence of technology, as well as ethical questions and leadership styles.  They will also develop interviewing and networking skills.  Requirements for UIP 350 enrollment are more than three years of work experience or  an already-completed department or UIP internship course.  Students are required to work 100 hours during the quarter.  All of our 4-credit UIP courses fulfill the JYEL learning requirement. If you have completed the requirement already, the course will be counted as a general elective course."
