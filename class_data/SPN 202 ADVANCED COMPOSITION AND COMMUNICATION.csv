SPN 202 ADVANCED COMPOSITION AND COMMUNICATION
"Students will work on improving their speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills in Spanish at the advanced level as they explore various topics related to the history and cultures of the Spanish-speaking world. Students will focus a little more, however, on written expression. Readings for the class will serve as models for various types of writing (primarily exposition and argumentation), and students will analyze the structure of these models as well as discuss their content. The course will also place emphasis on the effective use of the dictionary and on mechanics (such as spelling and punctuation). SPN 106 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended."
