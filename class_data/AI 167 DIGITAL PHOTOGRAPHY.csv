AI 167 DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY
"Students learn in this course to take artistic digital photos. They will analyze photos they have taken prior to the course and discuss if they fulfill criteria to be seen as art. Several theories of artistic expression will be discussed. Rules of composition, light, exposure, colors, etc. will be reflected upon. In a second step the students will develop the competence to alter their digital photos with a program like ""Photoshop Elements"". They will be able to change the expression of their photos and combine different shots, creating their personal piece of art. As a final product, students will create a portfolio with about 5 photos including detailed descriptions of their work."
