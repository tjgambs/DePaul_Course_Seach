HST 299 CRAFT OF HISTORY
"This course is the second of two introductory core courses required of all history majors, history minors, and education majors with a concentration in history. In this class, students will bring to bear the skills in historical sources and methods learned in HST 298 to complete a substantial independent research project.  To that end, students will learn how to identify  a historical question or problem about which to conduct research; how to find, obtain, and evaluate primary source evidence to research; how to build a secondary source bibliography using reference works, monographs, and scholarly journal articles; and develop and execute a coherent plan for writing and revising a substantial research paper (of at least 10 pages in length) based on an integrated use of both primary and secondary sources."
