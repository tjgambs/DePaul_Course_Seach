THE 223 IMPROVISATION FOR FUN AND PROFIT
"Improvisation for the theatre was originally developed as a means of bringing diverse populations of people together in a creative, non-competitive, environment.  Improvisation for performance was developed by The Compass Players and The Second City and has influenced generations of theatre artists from Alan Arkin to Tina Fey.  The essentials of improvisation, however, remain applicable to everyone.  In this course, sessions will include theatre games, ensemble building exercises, and scene structures.  We will explore how the practice of improvisation creates opportunities for connection, creativity, and spontaneity.  This class is for anyone who wants to enhance their abilities to act and interact with others."
