PSC 140 INTRODUCTION TO INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
"Three main themes are dealt with: the nature of power in the international political system, conflict and conflict resolution in the system, and the basis of national foreign policy decisions. Issues of current importance, such as the likelihood of global war, conflict between rich and poor nations, and East-West relations, provide the substantive material to illuminate these main themes."
