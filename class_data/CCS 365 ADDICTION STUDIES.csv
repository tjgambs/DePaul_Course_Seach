CCS 365 ADDICTION STUDIES
"This is an introductory course in the field of addiction studies.  In this course we will examine the relationship between drugs and behavior, the personal and social concerns of drug-taking behavior and how drugs work in the body and mind.  Legal and legally restricted drugs as well as medical drugs will be discussed.  We will also cover issues of prevention, treatment and education.  By the end of this course students will understand (1) the differences between use, abuse and addiction to drugs; (2) the extent of substance abuse in the United States today; (3) the legal, social and cultural ramifications of substance abuse; (4) methods of treatment and prevention of substance abuse; (5) major classifications of addictive substances; and (6) how drugs work in mind and body.
This course will be a mix of lecture, discussion, videos and other supplemental materials.  In addition to their competence papers, students will work in small groups on projects related to addiction and will present their group's findings to the class."
