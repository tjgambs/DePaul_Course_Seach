ANI 101 ANIMATION FOR NON-MAJORS
"Course introduces a variety of basic animation techniques for cinema and gaming, such as hand-drawn, cutout, stop-motion and (very basic) 3D, with an emphasis on the use of computer technology.  Examples of diverse animation genres and styles (experimental, cartoon, anime, special effects, computer games) from different cultures will be screened and discussed.  Students will explore the unique qualities of the medium through a series of hands-on projects that can be adapted to their own personal interests.  They will learn about professional animation process (storyboard and animatic) during the production of a final project that encourages them to consider the role and potential of animation in our society."
