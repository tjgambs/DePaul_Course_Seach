HC 365 JAZZ AND CHICAGO
"This short course will introduce the student to the pleasures and enrichment of jazz. Students will learn what jazz is, learn about its fascinating history and some of its most influential players, and learn about the special role that Chicago has played-and still does play-in great jazz. In the classroom we'll hear records, view videos, engage the instructor in question-and-answer sessions, and hear stories about this unique musical art form and Chicago's ongoing role in it. The instructor, a jazz writer and longtime jazz drummer, will enliven the course with personal anecdotes covering a considerable part of Chicago jazz history."
