FIN 363 DERIVATIVES: PRICING & APPLICATIONS
"This is an advanced course that focuses on the pricing models for the four derivative instruments:  forwards, futures, options and swaps.  The first part of the course is devoted to the two general classes of derivative pricing models:  discrete time and continuous time, with each model's properties discussed in detail.  These models are then applied to a range of realistic pricing situations which include swaps, exotic options and fixed income derivatives.  The course concludes with a detailed examination of value at risk."
