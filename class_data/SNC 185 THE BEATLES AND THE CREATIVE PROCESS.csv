SNC 185 THE BEATLES AND THE CREATIVE PROCESS
"This course is offered in SNL's online program.  Online course conform to University scheduling, but are conducted exclusively through Desire to Learn (D2L).  There are no in person class meetings.

The Beatles are significant in many ways: they were an unprecedented show business phenomenon; they were leaders of Sixties cultural rebellion; and they stand, for many, as a signal instance of popular entertainment attaining the status of high art.  This course will examine the musical craftsmanship of the Beatles, focusing on their work as songwriters and record makers.  Recent audio and print releases documenting the group's performing and recording history provide a unique and detailed glimpse of the Beatles' creative process.  We will utilize these materials to closely trace the development of the group's work while using other resources to place it in a larger historical and cultural context.  The goal is to shed critical light on this recent chapter in cultural history.  That discussion will, in turn, highlight questions about creativity in a modern context where commerce vies with art, technology redefines performance and an emerging global village culture transforms concepts of originality and tradition.  Arts and Literature."
