EE 324 READING/LANGUAGE ARTS IN THE EARLY YEARS
"This course focuses on the curriculum content and sequence, instructional and assessment strategies as well as considerations integral to the creation of authentic, effective emergent literacy environments and engagements for pre-kindergarten through third grade. Theory and practice principles are woven into course assignments and required field experiences designed to observe, teach, and reflect upon instructional decisions made for individual as well as groups of children. Prevailing curricular and instructional models (e.g., code-based, meaning-oriented, balanced) and their histories are compared and contrasted. The influences of development, home language(s) and dialect(s) (especially those of U.S. metropolitan areas), and educational settings are studied and applied to candidate instructional planning and teaching.  Case studies and lesson planning facilitate the application of course content."
