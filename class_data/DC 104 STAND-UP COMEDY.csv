DC 104 STAND-UP COMEDY
"Students will analyze and practice stand-up comedy as an art form, both onstage and as a foundation for film and television work. Students will learn about the history of stand-up comedy, particularly about the comedians who parlayed success on the stage into success in television and films, such as Bob Hope, Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor, Jerry Seinfeld, Dave Chappelle, Ellen Degeneres, Louis C.K., etc. The process of how comedians create material and hone it on stage will be analyzed. Additionally, students will mine their own lives for material, creating original stand-up comedy routines and work-shopping them in class. Finally, these routines will be performed in public, at venues such as the Main Stage at the world-renowned Zanies Comedy Club."
