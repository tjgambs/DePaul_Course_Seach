CHE 474 ADVANCED QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
"One of three courses in physical chemistry for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in the M.S. program.  CHE474 is focused on quantum mechanics and will build on fundamental principles introduced in undergraduate quantum chemistry, including an examination of the particle-in-a-box, rigid rotor, and harmonic oscillator models.  More advanced quantum mechanical topics such as the Dirac representation, wave packet motion, and time-dependent perturbation theory may also be explored.  These topics can be used to understand phenomena such as coherent control of reactions, vibrational energy redistribution, and electronic energy transfer.  The primary goals of this course are to: 1) increase students? understanding of quantum mechanical principles; 2) apply quantum mechanics to spectroscopic problems; and 3) expose students to modern literature related to quantum mechanics."
