CSC 382 APPLIED IMAGE ANALYSIS
"Fundamentals of computational image analysis will be explored in terms of its two most important components, image information extraction and modeling of image patterns.  These components will be studied in the context of image representation, segmentation, classification, retrieval and recognition.  The course will be useful for students interested in image analysis related to areas such as image databases, multimedia management, animation, GIS, computer graphics, medical imaging, remote sensing and robotics.  Specific topics include, but are not limited to segmentation, multi-scale representation, shape analysis, texture analysis, Fourier analysis, wavelets, Gabor and fractal analysis, template matching, and object recognition.
