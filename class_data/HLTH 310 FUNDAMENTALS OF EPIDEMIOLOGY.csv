HLTH 310 FUNDAMENTALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
"Epidemiology is generally considered to be the basic science of disease prevention. It encompasses the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related conditions in specified populations, and the application of this study to control health problems. This course will introduce students to methods employed by epidemiologists to collect data about the health of populations, to use epidemiologic data to generate and test hypotheses about the relationships
between exposure and disease or other health conditions, and to use epidemiologic data that informs interventions and public policy that will address health problems and prevent their recurrence."
