"CCA 219 SPACE, SPIRITUALITY, AND HUMAN IDENTITY"
"The course will examine the architecture and context of the sacred spaces of the ancient and medieval world.  Different perspectives will be used to study the spaces, including art historical, historical, anthropological and religious.  This class will look at how sacred spaces are affected by a variety of factors in each society.  These include the religious and social beliefs of the society, the availability of materials, the technical skills of the artists and builders and the world view of the people.  Students will also consider how these issues are manifested in our own culture and how they are seen and experienced in their individual lives.  The class will use multimedia resources to experience the monuments more fully."
