"BBE 360 SECOND, WORLD AND HERITAGE LANGUAGE ACQUISITION K-12"
"This course is an introduction to the theoretical study of second, world and heritage language acquisition (SLA) from a generative and psycholinguistic perspective at the K-12 levels. The content of the class is founded on the major concepts and issues of language acquisition, including UG-access, L1-transfer, age effects, and the acquisition of form vs. meaning. The course pays particular attention to empirical second and world language studies at the syntax/semantics interface. Course readings and discussion examine the complexities of the processes involved in acquiring a world language that includes the relation between first and SLA; contrastive and error analysis; interlanguage; the social and cultural influences on SLA; learner variability; learning strategies; and classroom interaction analysis. Issues surrounding second and world language acquisition are discussed and deliberated through university classroom experiences as well as required field experiences (20/15 hours; level 2)."
