MPH 511 HEALTH AND BEHAVIOR THEORY
"This course will examine various theories and models that have been developed to identify the range of psychosocial factors that impact participation in both health-threatening and health-enhancing behaviors, and provide guidance for the modification of such behaviors.  The theories and models will be explored from multidisciplinary perspectives and will be applied to an array of health issues.  Practical applications of these theories to the development and implementations of theory-based public health interventions that can be applied with multiple populations (e.g., women, adolescents, elderly, people of color) within multiple settings (e.g., communities, schools, health care settings) at various levels of change (e.g., individual, community, social, policy) will also be explored.  Cross-listed with PSY 511."
