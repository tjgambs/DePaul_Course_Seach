CMNS 545 COMMUNICATION AND TECHNOLOGY
"Communication and Technology explores the process through which technological and social systems co-create or invent each other. As such, this course not only examines the role that new communication technologies play in shaping our social systems and the organizations within them, but also looks at how social, cultural, economic and legal contexts influence the development and emergence of these technologies."
