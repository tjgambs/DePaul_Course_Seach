AAS 224 HINDU THOUGHT AND CULTURE
"An exploration of Hinduism as a civilization whose key reference points are religious in the sense understood in the West (ritual and transcendence), yet which finds expression in a ""high culture"" of literary works, political and social theory, art and architecture, music and dance, and folk and popular stories, songs and plays. Cross-listed with REL 242."
