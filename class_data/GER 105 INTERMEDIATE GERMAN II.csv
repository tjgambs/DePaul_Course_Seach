GER 105 INTERMEDIATE GERMAN II
"This course is the second quarter of second-year college German, and emphasizes language as communication in real-life situations and as a means to immerse ourselves in the cultures of German-speaking countries. Though students will review and perfect their knowledge of German grammar throughout the year, they will focus on the perfection of the four language skills reading, writing, listening and speaking. Students will have ample opportunities to express themselves in German, acquire basic discussion strategies, and gain insight into many aspects of the contemporary cultures and societies of German-speaking countries. GER 104 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended."
