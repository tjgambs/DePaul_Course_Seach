PRF 222 MOVEMENT II
Focus will be on full body awareness through Feldenkrais' (and other) movement lessons and through the study of anatomy.  Emphasis will be placed on recognizing limiting patterns of response in the self (including inappropriate tensions) and moving beyond those to increase the physical choices and alternatives available to the student.  Work is begun on the dynamics of movement and on embodying a role.
