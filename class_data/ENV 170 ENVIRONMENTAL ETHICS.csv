ENV 170 ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
"The environmental issues that confront us are both global and local; they involve political, economic and ethical decision-making by governments, corporations and citizens. Students will explore and evaluate diverse approaches to a range of such issues, as well as the ways different thinkers and different cultures have envisioned the relationship between human beings and the natural world-all with a view to understanding their own relationships to the natural world, their own environmental ethics."
