NSG 301 INTRODUCTION TO THE ART AND SCIENCE OF NURSING I
"The foundations of the art and science of nursing are developed through the study and practice of basic nursing skills, therapeutic communication and critical thinking in classroom, laboratory  and clinical settings.  Foundations are strengthened through exposure to theories of human development, aging, stress, health teaching and health promotion.  Knowledge is applied to the care of older adults in the clinical setting, facilitating student   understanding of individual expressions of wellness, health and illness, and the development of a professional value system."
