"SW 367 LEISURE, RECREATION, AND HEALTH"
"This course will stimulate your thinking about the meaning of leisure in your life.  Leisure today and historically has been central to the human experience.  It is an elemental experience, essential to the total well-being of every person; it is a reflection and expression of the cultural values of a society; it is an important vehicle for treatment.  Leisure and recreation services are also essential for healthy communities in terms of social climate, environmental quality, and economic stability.  Leisure services comprise one of the largest and fastest growing industries in the world, whether measured in dollars spent, persons served, hours of time devoted, or resources used.  The study of leisure and recreation is a broad discipline, combining diverse fields of study and professional practice.  This course will (1) illustrate the importance of leisure to you and your loved ones, (2) contribute to your ability to become an informed consumer of leisure, (3) question the binary relationship of work and leisure and, (4) teach you how to use leisure to increase emotional and physical health, resulting in a higher quality of life.  The course will be interactive and participatory."
