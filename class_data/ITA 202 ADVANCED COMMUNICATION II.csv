ITA 202 ADVANCED COMMUNICATION II
"This course is designed for students of Italian language and culture at the advanced level who wish to secure their knowledge of Italian structure, expand their vocabulary and cultural literacy, and work on their writing skills. The 200-level sequence creates opportunities for students who already have significant background in Italian to make progress in all four areas of language acquisition (reading, understanding, writing and speaking). This quarter will focus on Italian culture and society through history. Students will also review Italian grammar as students work on their language skills through class discussion and targeted assignments. ITA 106 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended."
