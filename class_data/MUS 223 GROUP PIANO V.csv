MUS 223 GROUP PIANO V
"The fifth of six courses in a two year (six-quarter) sequence of two one-hour classes per week using electronic piano labs. Curriculum is organized on the basis of six levels of functional keyboard competence, coordinated with the two-year Musicianship Studies experience described above.  Emphasis is on sight-reading, harmonization, theory, score-reading, accompanying and ensemble playing.  Note: Students with extensive previous keyboard experience may complete the competence requirements in fewer than six quarters."
