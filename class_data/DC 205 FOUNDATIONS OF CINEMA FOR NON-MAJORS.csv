DC 205 FOUNDATIONS OF CINEMA FOR NON-MAJORS
"This course will examine the craft, technology, and aesthetic principles of media production. Drawing heavily on a wide array of historical examples, the course will examine the many expressive strategies potentially usable in the creation of moving image art forms: the importance of story and controlling ideas, storytelling with images, the basics of composition and editing, and an examination of narrative, documentary, and experimental approaches. In addition to analyzing the works of others, students will also produce their own projects thus, putting theory into practice."
