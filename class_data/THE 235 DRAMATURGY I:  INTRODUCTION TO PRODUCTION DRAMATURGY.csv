THE 235 DRAMATURGY I:  INTRODUCTION TO PRODUCTION DRAMATURGY
"The second class in the three-term Dramaturgy I sequence, this course continues the work of THE 234 and emphasizes writing in a workshop context as well as the process of collaboration and hands-on collaboration itself.  Much of the student work focuses on in-house theoretical theatre productions.  Students who are dramaturgy-criticism majors prepare to work on their first dramaturgy project, the MFAI short plays."
