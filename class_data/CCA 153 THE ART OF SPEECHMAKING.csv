CCA 153 THE ART OF SPEECHMAKING
"In our class, students will use tools based in the imagination, principles of design, and standard dramatic practice to create a unique, personal experience for an audience. The criteria for success is established through an examination of and critique of the content goals.

Speech, whether we call it dramatic or declamatory, has the potential to move the masses. In this course, our students will discover their personal approaches and attributes, and construct effective presentations that harness the power of their voice and body."
