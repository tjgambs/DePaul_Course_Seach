TEC 268 STAGE MANAGEMENT I
"Second course in a 3 course sequence. This course will be divided into pre-production, rehearsal period, tech/running, and maintenance of production segments. The objective is to thoroughly introduce the student to the different venues of theatre from small storefront theatre to large regional theatres. Although the emphasis will be on management practices for theatre in all venues, there will be an element of the practical, day-to-day ""nuts and bolts"" in the stage management process."
