SPN 451 SPANISH IN THE U.S.
"Spanish is the second most widely spoken language in the United States; it has been spoken in this country longer than English has. This course is an introduction to the varieties of Spanish spoken in the US. Students will examine the evolution of the phonological, grammatical, and lexical linguistic system of the Spanish of US Latino/a communities. Students will also explore how sociolinguistic concepts such as bilingualism, diglossia, code-switching, linguistic variation, linguistic change, standard vs. non- prestigious varieties, language attitudes, manifest in the US Spanish context. This course is intended to familiarize the students with issues of language use in social context. Students will discuss results of research on the relationship between language and society in US Spanish-speaking communities. They will become familiar with sociolinguistic concepts. Students also acquire experience in carrying out sociolinguistic research. SPN 242 strongly recommended."
