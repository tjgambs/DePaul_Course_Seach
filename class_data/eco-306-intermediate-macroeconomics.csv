ECO 306 INTERMEDIATE MACROECONOMICS
"The purpose of this course is to develop macroeconomic models that assist in understanding the myriad economic problems facing us today, both domestic and foreign, and in evaluating proposed solutions. These static and dynamic models are used to understand interactions in the macroeconomy, and will serve as a tool in predicting the level of GDP, inflation, unemployment and interest rates. Models included are: traditional short-run Keynesian analysis; the New Classical market-clearing approach; and the recent work in Neo-Keynesian thought."
