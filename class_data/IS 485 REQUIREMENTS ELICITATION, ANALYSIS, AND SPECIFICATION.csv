"IS 485 REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION, ANALYSIS, AND SPECIFICATION"
"This course focuses on the concepts and skills needed to elicit, analyze, specify, and manage requirements for a software or systems level project. Students will learn to identify and work with stakeholders through conducting a variety of requirements gathering techniques including interviewing, surveying, ethnography, and Joint Application Design (JAD) sessions, to identify and analyse requirements conflicts and negotiate solutions,  to model requirements and specify them in unambiguous ways, and to manage requirements throughout the software lifecycle using change
controls, traceability, and impact analysis techniques.  The requirements process will be examined in both traditional and agile environments. Current topics such as requirements for product lines or distributed development teams will also be explored as time permits.  PREREQUISITE(S): IS 422 or IS 430 or PM 430.  A student may not take both SE 482 and IS 485 for credit toward a degree."
