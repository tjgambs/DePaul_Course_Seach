AT 585 PROSEMINAR II: APPLYING INDEPENDENT LEARNING IN PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE
"Through small group meetings and/or individualized tutorials, this seminar outlines the purpose and process of moving graduate learning into self-initiated, self-designed and self-managed application beyond the classroom. Students are guided in identifying independent projects associated with work-based problems/issues related to their specialized tracks as well as learning opportunities related to their reflective practices. Special emphasis is placed on developing (and seeking approval for) project proposals for the culmination phase of the MSAT Program including implementation plans for translating proposals into execution strategies and eventual deliverables"
