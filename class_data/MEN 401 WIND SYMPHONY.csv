MEN 401 WIND SYMPHONY
"The Wind Symphony is an ensemble designed to prepare wind and percussion students for careers as performers, teachers, and other careers in music. The goal is to achieve a high level of musicianship through repertoire selected by the instructor and rehearsal/performance preparation demonstrated by the individual members of the ensemble.  While setting a high performance expectation, a productive and meaningful music-making environment will also be fostered. All MEN courses are repeatable courses.  Placement audition required."
