DC 110 FOUNDATIONS OF CINEMA FOR MAJORS
"This course deals with visualization and cinema literacy skills.  Drawing heavily on a wide array of historical examples, the course will examine the many expressive strategies potentially usable in the creation of moving image art forms: image construction and manipulation, editing, composition, sound, narrative, and performance.  An emphasis will be placed on story and storytelling.  In addition to analyzing the works of others, students will also produce their own projects - putting theory into practice. Prerequisite(s): None"
