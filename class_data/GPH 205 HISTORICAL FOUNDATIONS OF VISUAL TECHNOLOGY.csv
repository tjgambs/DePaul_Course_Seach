GPH 205 HISTORICAL FOUNDATIONS OF VISUAL TECHNOLOGY
"This course is a survey of the development, application and meaning of visual technologies in a wide range of world cultures from pre-history to the present. It traces the unique intersection of mathematics and physical culture that marks design science, as it has been realized in a variety of human societies. The course includes works of art that emphasize those mathematical and geometric elements that are antecedent to contemporary graphic technology."
