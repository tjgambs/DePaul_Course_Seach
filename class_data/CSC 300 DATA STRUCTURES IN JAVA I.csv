CSC 300 DATA STRUCTURES IN JAVA I
"This is the first course in a two-course sequence on data structures using Java.  The course introduces basic Java programming, reviews recursion, introduces asymptotic notations, and focuses mainly on linear data structures including arrays, linked lists and their variants, stacks and queues, and data structures supporting disjoint-set operations.  The implementation of the basic operations on each data structure are discussed and analyzed in terms of their efficiency. The applications covered highlight and exploit the unique characteristics of the data structures, and emphasize problem solving and recursive thinking.  Prerequisite(s): CSC 242 or CSC 243"
