"FA 325 CONNECTING THOUGHT AND BEHAVIOR IN THE WORKPLACE, THE COMMUNITY, AND IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE"
"This course introduces students to practical concepts of Cognitive Behavioral Psychology and offers them new perspectives on how to observe and understand the interaction between thoughts and behaviors in their daily lives.  Students will evaluate the tendencies and correlations between what a person ""thinks"" and what that person ""does"" through observation and interpretation of their own experiences.  A report will be generated that will include an analysis of the student's own cognitive behavioral tendencies and a plan for personal development."
