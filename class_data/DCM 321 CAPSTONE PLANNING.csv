DCM 321 CAPSTONE PLANNING
"Students will begin the research for their capstone project, one that is directly related to the major and meant to be the final entry in the professional portfolio. Project ideas and topics will be discussed, refined, and formally proposed. Students will complete a review of the appropriate literature and construct a methodology by which they will carry out the capstone project in the final quarter."
