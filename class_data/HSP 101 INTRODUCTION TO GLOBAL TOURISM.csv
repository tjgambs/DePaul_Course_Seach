HSP 101 INTRODUCTION TO GLOBAL TOURISM
"This course takes a cross-disciplinary approach to examine the many facets of tourism. Specific analysis of world travel destinations, customs and traditions, visitor attractions, political, religious and other cultural differences as these relate to the tourism industry will be introduced. This course evaluates tourism globally while identifying economic, socio-cultural, and environmental impacts on host destinations from the perspectives of the local communities as well as the traveler. The basic dimensions of sustainability, civic engagement, ethics, service and the historical perspective that are integral to the tourism industry will be covered from a social science perspective, in order to provide students with the kind of practical knowledge that can be applied in many fields of study.  This course is intended for non-Commerce students and cannot be counted toward a major or minor in Hospitality Leadership."
