NMS 508 DESIGN RHETORICS
"This course provides students with a theoretical foundation and practical skills in the design of rhetorically sophisticated new media objects. We will learn basic principles of visual composition, both by examining existing compositions and building our own. We will also seek to understand the way visual literacies and culture shape the rhetorical choices we make as designers and managers of new media projects."
