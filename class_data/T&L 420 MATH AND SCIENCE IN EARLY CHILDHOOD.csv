T&L; 420 MATH AND SCIENCE IN EARLY CHILDHOOD
"This course applies child development principles to the planning of science and mathematics experiences for both typically and atypically developing young children.  Emphasis is placed on understanding how children develop problem-solving skills, and on recognizing how teachers can facilitate inquiry-discovery experiences for young children with diverse learning styles and needs.  Course assignments include participation in experiments and field-based experiences in mathematics and sciences.  Teacher candidates are required to develop and provide developmentally and culturally appropriate activities in science and mathematics activities for young children."
