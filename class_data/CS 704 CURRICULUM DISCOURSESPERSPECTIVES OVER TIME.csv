CS 704 CURRICULUM DISCOURSES/PERSPECTIVES OVER TIME
"This course focuses on the examination of the ways in which curriculum as a field has developed over time: attention to changes in terms of how it has been defined, conceptualized; theoretical and philosophical issues; assumptions and values; as well as implications for teaching and learning. These topics will be addressed within different historical and social contexts.  Readings will include primary texts by major theorists as well as secondary material including commentary and critique.  A primary goal of the course is to provide students with an overview of major movements in curriculum history as a foundation for further study.  This course will serve as a prerequisite for all other curriculum courses in the doctoral program."
