DCM 324 EFFECTIVE GROUP AND PERSONAL DYNAMICS
"This course design unifies two levels of human behavior and motivation: group and personal. Processes leading to decision-making and other actions rest in articulable patterns on both corporate and individual dimensions. We seek, in this educational arena, to activate and analyze this set of motives and to apprehend, and perhaps predict, this bi-lateral source of human motivation. In so doing, the group-level patterns leading to appreciable action and those emanating from each individual will more easily be understood, and their root patterns put to beneficial use."
