SPN 201 ADVANCED GRAMMAR AND COMMUNICATION
"In this class students will work toward improving their speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills in Spanish at the advanced level as they explore various topics related to the history and cultures of the Spanish-speaking world. Students will also focus on four major grammar points that typically cause difficulty for students of Spanish as a foreign language: the distinction between ser and estar, verb tense, verb aspect (preterite/imperfect), and verb mood (indicative/subjunctive). SPN 106 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended."
