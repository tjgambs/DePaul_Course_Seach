PRF 572 MFA WORKSHOP I: ACTOR AS ENTREPRENEUR
"MFA Workshop (2) is a flexible laboratory time period designed to accommodate a number of possibilities of workshops, lectures, and demonstrations with guest artists mainly from the Chicago theatre community and beyond.  MFA Workshop also accommodates a number of projects generated by the MFA Acting students themselves.  As MFA Workshop is a process class, projects and workshops may or may not result in a showing.  (Some activities in the class will combine MFA I and MFA II students and some will be specific to each class.)"
