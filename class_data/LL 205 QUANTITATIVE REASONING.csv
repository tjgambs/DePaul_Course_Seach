LL 205 QUANTITATIVE REASONING
"This course provides an introduction to various topics in quantitative reasoning that most adults will be exposed to throughout their university coursework, their careers, and their daily lives, and how to more effectively handle these topics. It covers different approaches to problem solving, how numbers are used in the real world, how to manage your personal finances, basic concepts in statistics and how they are applied in everyday settings and, finally, how money and populations grow and decay. Scientific calculators and the Excel spreadsheet program will be used as tools for exploring algebraic and statistical concepts. Excel spreadsheets and charts are used extensively to illustrate graphically how to display, analyze and interpret data. Using mathematical models to understand real-world phenomena and to make predictions is an important component of the course.  Access to a PC and the Internet is required. Quantitative reasoning will be a large part of the class discussion."
