"HC 233 CHRISTIANITIES: ANCIENT, MODERN, GLOBAL"
"A close reading of the New Testament reveals a diversity of beliefs and practices that developed when people of different cultures accepted the preaching of early Christian missionaries. The engagement of later Christian communities with an even greater variety of cultures has contributed to the spread of various ideas, practices, and institutions--religious and secular--to many parts of the world. Meanwhile, local and regional expressions of Christianity reflect the influence of the cultures with which they have interacted. This course will identify some of these varied expressions of Christianity and will explore the development of ""modern"" culture both as a consequence of, and a reaction to, the dominant role of Christian beliefs and practices in many European cultures. We will also consider the impact of the rejection of modern values by some believers, which has led to profound divisions within many Christian denominations. The course will investigate how Western Christianity may have contributed to the various cultural phenomena that are associated with globalization. At the same time, we will also address the criticisms of globalization by many Christians and communities of Christians throughout the world.  Competences: A3X, H2X, H3G, H5."
