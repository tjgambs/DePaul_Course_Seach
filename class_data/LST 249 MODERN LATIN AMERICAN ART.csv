LST 249 MODERN LATIN AMERICAN ART
"This lecture class is a survey of Latin American art created since the Wars of Independence which helped to create the modern nations in the 19th century (i.e. 1820s through the present). Lectures consider the struggle of artists to articulate newly sovereign identities through visual production, even as complicated relationships with Europe and increasingly, the United States, continue. Topics covered include Latin American modernism, surrealism, radical arts, and social realism, with a special consideration of post-revolutionary Mexican mural painting. Cross-listed with HAA 247."
