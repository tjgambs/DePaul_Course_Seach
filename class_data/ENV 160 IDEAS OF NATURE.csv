ENV 160 IDEAS OF NATURE
"This course is an introductory history of the ideas of nature that emerged over the last two and a half centuries in Europe and the United States. We examine how the conceptions, meanings, and values of nature today have been influenced by the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions, Romanticism, and evolutionary theory; notions of the sublime, the frontier, and wilderness; and the practices of conservation, preservation, and restoration. Also discussed are the ideological commitments of current environmentalisms, in particular sustainability."
