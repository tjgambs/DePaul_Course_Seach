"ECO 529 COMPETITION, STRATEGY AND POLICY"
"This class introduces major topics in the economics of imperfectly competitive industries, competition policy, and the economics of incentives and information. The main goals are to understand basic firm behaviors and interactions under various industry configurations, and to scrutinize these behaviors and interactions through the lenses of competition policies (antitrust laws and regulation). We will draw on microeconomic theory, game theory and competitive strategy, as well as empirical evidence and a variety of case studies."
