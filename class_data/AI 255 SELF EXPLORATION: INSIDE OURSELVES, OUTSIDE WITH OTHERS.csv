"AI 255 SELF EXPLORATION: INSIDE OURSELVES, OUTSIDE WITH OTHERS"
"Exploring the self can be a very personal and satisfying experience, but can also provide clues as to how you interact with others, accomplish daily tasks and become a more happy, productive and respected individual. This course guides you through a self reflection process in a collaborative learning mode where you will learn about yourself, share the process with a learning partner and observe the trends and conclusions of the class. This course will operate in a unique blended format with three required meetings which will link students in the classroom to other students taking the course online in a synchronis chat format. You will have the option to  attend either on campus or online for the scheduled meetings."
