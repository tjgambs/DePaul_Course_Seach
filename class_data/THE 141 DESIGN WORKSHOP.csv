THE 141 DESIGN WORKSHOP
"First course in a 3 course sequence. This course will introduce the student to the art of theatre design through the examination of the principles of design and composition, the elements of theatrical design, and the nature of collaboration and communication.  It is intended for those who plan to work in the theatre in areas other than design.  The focus is on the aesthetic, rather than the technical, aspects of design and on how design fits into the framework of the study of theatre in general.  The class is intended to prepare those pursuing a career in theatre for communicating and working with designers.  Assignments will emphasize the development of creative skills and a common vocabulary in order to establish a framework for informed choices, and for an appreciation of theatre design and its various areas of specialization.  In this first course we will explore the fundamentals of visual design.  Students will do several basic design projects during the quarter.  The process of theatrical design will be introduced by working with a classic script for design analysis and preliminary design parameters."
