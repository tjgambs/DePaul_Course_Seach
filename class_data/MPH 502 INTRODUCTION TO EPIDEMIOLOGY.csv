MPH 502 INTRODUCTION TO EPIDEMIOLOGY
"This course will focus on the theories and methods used in the field of epidemiology to study the occurrence, distribution and determinants of infectious and non-infectious diseases, other forms of illness (particularly those impacted by social and environmental forces), and injury in human populations.  The focus will be on determining the impact, magnitude, and patterns of disease/illness/injury frequency so that causal agents can be identified and effective prevention, treatment and control measures can be designed and implemented.  The course will explore variations of disease/illness/injury in relation to such factors as age, sex, race/ethnicity, occupational and social characteristics, place of residence, social inequality, susceptibility, exposure to specific agents, and other pertinent characteristics.  Also of concern will be the temporal distribution of disease, examination of trends, cyclical patterns, and intervals between exposure to causative factors and onset of disease."
