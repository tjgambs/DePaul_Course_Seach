VFX 474 DIGITAL COMPOSITING I
"Compositing is the art of combining all the elements of a Visual Effect in one frame, making it look like it was all shot at the same time, under the same lights, with the same camera. This class introduces the fundamental techniques of digital compositing, using Adobe After Effects. It also introduces students to the design, planning and production workflows of a modern VFX project, through a VFX story written, planned and produced in class."
