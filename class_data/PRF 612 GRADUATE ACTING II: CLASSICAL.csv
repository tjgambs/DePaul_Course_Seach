PRF 612 GRADUATE ACTING II: CLASSICAL
"In winter quarter, students work with dramatic monologues, explore and study Shakespeare's prose and scenes from the Jacobean playwrights John Webster, John Ford and Thomas Middleton.  Though prose lacks meter, it has its own rhythm, in part defined by punctuation and rhetorical shape. Finding that rhythm of thought is essential to the clarity and life of the prose. With prose, as with meter, rhetoric, and imagery, we approach the work through both brain and body: balancing analytical and physical techniques for understanding and harnessing the dynamics of Shakespeare's language."
