MOL 211 ANCIENT GREEK AND ROMAN EPIC
"This course centers upon the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey and Vergil's Aeneid and endeavors to place these epic poems into their historical, social, and cultural contexts. Students will learn the definition of epic as a literary genre and discover how this genre evolved to reflect audiences and times. They will learn the components of epic language, in particular, literary devices and structural features (e.g., formulas, nested stories, epic similes). They will be able to describe the plots of the three epics and know the main- and mid-level human characters, gods, and goddesses. They will be able to define and better understand the meanings of ""hero"" and ""heroism."" Students will be able to express mature appreciation for the epics as whole works. Learning how the epics are variously interpreted as well as basic methods of literary criticism (e.g., analysis of language, content, structure, etc.), students will employ these as ways to understand and interpret the poems. As they read, learn and evaluate modern views of the epics, students will also acquire better means to distinguish critically between views and interpretations. A strong emphasis in this class will be upon the vital connections between past and present, and how students can become more aware of and understand important lasting concepts such as heroism, leadership, self-definition, etc. Finally, students will relate these stories to modern story-telling in order to understand how the heroes of the ancient Greeks live with us today. In short, they will interpret what epic poetry offered ancient listeners and what it has to teach modern readers. The classical tradition is rich with meaning and significance, even to modern 21st century adults and this class will not only be an exploration of the culture and instruction of the ancient world through epic, but an investigation of what classic motifs remain with us today."
