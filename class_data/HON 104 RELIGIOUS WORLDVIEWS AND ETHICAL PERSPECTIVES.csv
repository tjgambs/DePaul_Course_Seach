HON 104 RELIGIOUS WORLDVIEWS AND ETHICAL PERSPECTIVES
"This course focuses on the collective construction of cultural reality and examines people's confrontation with the sacred as a formative instrument in this process. The overriding concern of Honors 104 is with the meaning and function of culture as a system or world that we inhabit. This world with its distinctive concepts of ultimacy, time, space, cosmos, and life passages is created and enacted through myths, narratives, and ritual performances. Students will develop analytical skills necessary to apply theoretical explanations and interpretations to the process of constructing cultural reality. All sections of the course will involve a field experience in which students enter the world of a community which is not part of their own experience."
