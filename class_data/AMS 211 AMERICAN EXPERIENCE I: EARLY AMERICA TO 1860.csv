AMS 211 AMERICAN EXPERIENCE I: EARLY AMERICA TO 1860
"The first of the three-course sequence that forms the American Studies core. Like all the courses in the sequence, it focuses on how to do American Studies by using a variety of materials and projects that center on a particular historical period (in this case, early America before the Civil War).  The course utilizes multiple methodologies, primary sources, a range of texts, and material and visual culture to examine the competing themes and diverse voices that form American experience during the era. Formerly AMS 201."
