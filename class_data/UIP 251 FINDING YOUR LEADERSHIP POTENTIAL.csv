UIP 251 FINDING YOUR LEADERSHIP POTENTIAL
"In UIP 251 students will learn about the principles and practices of effective leadership through the study of leadership topics and by researching visionary leaders. Students will also strengthen key leadership skills, apply those skills at their internship sites and identify ways to be a leader in a potential career. This is a hybrid course that will meet five times per quarter. Students are required to work 100 hours. Attendance at an internship orientation is required.
 All of our 4-credit UIP courses fulfill the JYEL learning requirement. If you have completed the requirement already, the course will be counted as a general elective course."
