ART 200 ART & ARTISTS IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE
"This course will use a mixed lecture/discussion format and thematic approach to consider works on art and design produced in the last 30 years as a means of contextualizing recent works of art.  The primary approach to this material will be from the perspective of the artmaker (artist or designer), for whom art theory, criticism and history are crucial tools for developing effective and meaningful work.  For that reason, this class will be taught by studio faculty.  The class will make extensive use of the city's contemporary museums, galleries, exhibitions and works of public art to emphasize the social, economic and political context from which works of art and design emerge as indicators or signposts of contemporary cultural concerns.  Students cannot receive credit for both ART 200 and ART 222."
