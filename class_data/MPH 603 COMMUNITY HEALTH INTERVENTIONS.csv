MPH 603 COMMUNITY HEALTH INTERVENTIONS
This is the second course of the three-course practicum sequence.  Students are expected to engage in the following tasks:  (1) assess the community health profile documenting incidence and prevalence of disease and other health problems; (2) use the findings identified in step one to plan a population-specific community-based health program designed to reduce assessed risk; (3) develop an evaluation instrument designed to determine how successful the plan is in reducing health risk.
