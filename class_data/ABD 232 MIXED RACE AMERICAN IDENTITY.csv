ABD 232 MIXED RACE AMERICAN IDENTITY
"The 1967 Supreme Court decision in the case of Loving vs. the State of Virginia overturned laws that prohibited individuals from different racial backgrounds from marrying. Since then, people from mixed racial and ethnic backgrounds have advocated for legal recognition of their status as members of more than one racial group. This course explores the transformation of these ""interracial intimacies"" from a cultural taboo to a source of personal identity. By placing their lives and experiences in the appropriate historical and cultural context, we will explore how people who identify as ""mixed"" negotiate the rigid boundaries of race in the United States."
