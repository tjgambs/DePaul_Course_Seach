FIN 513 MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS
"This course analyzes interest rates, foreign exchange rates, federal funds futures market, the operation and regulation of financial institutions, and the impact of Central Bank actions on securities markets and the economy. The educational objective of the course is to provide graduate business students with the opportunity to acquire a thorough understanding of the theoretical and applied concepts that determine the operations of the money and capital markets. When you finish this course you will be able to demonstrate how the release of economic news about the real sector and the conduct of monetary policy influence the pricing of assets (interest rates and foreign exchange rates); measure and evaluate the impact of central bank actions on securities markets and the economy; understand the importance of having an independent central bank for macroeconomic performance; measure and evaluate the price volatility of interest-bearing securities; and understand how central bank monetary and regulatory actions can affect the stability and soundness of financial institutions. This course is designed to achieve maximum student involvement in order to add the greatest amount of value to their graduate educational experience.  The emphasis will be on developing a toolkit to solve problems that financial analysts and other researchers encounter in security markets and financial institutions. We desire to become proficient in certain financial market concepts, analytical frameworks, data analysis, and various techniques in the field of financial economics. Accordingly, the course is structured to include extensive reading, several written statistical assignments, and class discussions that are based on the readings. These written assignments have three objectives: to make sure that the reading material has been absorbed in full measure; to serve as the foundation for class discussions; and, to provide students with the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the substantive class material and the ability to apply this material in ""real world"" situations."
