CSL 501 COUNSELING SKILLS
"This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive application and integration of the basic counseling skills used in the helping profession. Skills emphasized in the course include: active listening, attending, rapport building, empathy, paraphrasing, confrontation, reflection, and goal setting. These skills enable students to establish a helping relationship with a client, facilitate the client's self-exploration and engagement in counseling, and encourage the client's active progression towards achieving specified counseling goals. Students practice basic counseling skills and participate in in-vivo role-play through laboratory exercises in the Education and Counseling Center (ECC). The instructor gives feedback on skill development to students during face-to-face consultation and through the viewing of videotaped sessions."
