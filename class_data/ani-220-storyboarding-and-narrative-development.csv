ANI 220 STORYBOARDING AND NARRATIVE DEVELOPMENT
"This class will focus primarily on storyboarding and the aesthetic and practical uses of research, treatments, drawings, and found images as tools in the production of animations, films and game cinematics.  Students will complete a series of assignments that will utilize different methods of finding inspiration to make a cohesive, narrative work.  Various methods used in both commercial and independent productions will be presented as examples, and pre-production work from both live action and animated films will be viewed throughout the quarter.  Students will create several storyboards for short films, write treatments, and research design options.  PREREQUISITE(S):  ANI 101, ANI 201 or DC 110"
