DC 250 THE ART OF SCREEN ACTING
"This course will examine the role of acting, actors, and actor-director collaboration in the development of narrative cinema.  The screen demanded a new approach to acting which differed markedly from the theatrical traditions which proceeded it.  Seminal practitioners of actor training such as Constantin Stanislavski and his American interpreters Lee Strasberg, Sanford Meisner, and Stella Adler and their students (such as Brando, Pacino, DeNiro, Hoffman, and Duvall) have had an incalculable influence on how screen actors prepare for a role and work with directors.  This course will survey the major acting techniques and approaches, examine major films as case studies, and explore contemporary approaches to screen acting and actor-director collaboration in the cinema."
