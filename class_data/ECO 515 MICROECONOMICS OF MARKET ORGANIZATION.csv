ECO 515 MICROECONOMICS OF MARKET ORGANIZATION
"Imperfectly competitive markets are more common than perfectly competitive markets.  This course is about the effects of imperfectly competitive market structure on the organization, pricing, product choice, and entry of firms.  We will study the acquisition and use of market power, strategic competition across firms, private sector sources of market failure, and the role of government competition policy.  Factor markets will also be discussed."
