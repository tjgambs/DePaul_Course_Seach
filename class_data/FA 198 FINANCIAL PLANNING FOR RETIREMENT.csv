FA 198 FINANCIAL PLANNING FOR RETIREMENT
"This course concentrates on the financial issues of retirement:  income, savings, pensions, annuities, portfolios, health care, and taxes.  We look carefully at the range of decisions facing adults in the U.S. as they plan for their post-working years.  Learning focuses on best models of collaborating with financial experts, and planning for balance in life expectancy and assets (including real estate). The culmination of our course lies in the question of whether to remain employed for life; to resist retirement.  We examine that possibility in the light of current labor market practices and the potential benefits of elder entrepreneurship."
