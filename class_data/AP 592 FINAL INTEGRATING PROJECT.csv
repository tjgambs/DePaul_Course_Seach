AP 592 FINAL INTEGRATING PROJECT
"In fulfillment of the approved Integrating Project Proposal (AP-591), students develop and submit an original, independently-conducted project that provides a significant contribution to their areas of focus. Such projects incorporate elements of theory and practice and demonstrate integration of liberal learning and focus area competencies from across the MAAPS Program. (AP-591 and AP-592 serve as a culmination option for the MAAPS degree.)"
