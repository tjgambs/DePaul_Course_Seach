WRD 206 PROFESSIONAL WRITING
"In this introductory course, students learn fundamentals of professional writing, with a special focus on distinguishing academic writing from workplace writing. The course provides a solid foundation that students can build on as they develop specializations in their professional fields.  Through a series of short assignments, students explore the structure and format of typical professional writing documents, examine a variety of workplace writing situations, and begin developing a clear and concise style appropriate for professional settings. Students analyze and write a number of workplace genres, such as memos, emails, letters, resumes, short reports, web documents, and professional presentations."
