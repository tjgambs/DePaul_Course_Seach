CCH 299 ASSESSING AND MANAGING CONFLICT
"Our usual method for presenting, analyzing, and resolving conflicts has centered around legalistic argument; the goal being to discover the ""right"" answer and suppress the ""wrong"" ones.  However, the multiple worldviews operating in the world today make such an approach to conflict less viable.  Reflecting this reality, ways of communicating about and resolving conflict have arisen that go beyond enforcement of rules or legal determinations of right and wrong.  In this course, we will look at various methods for handling conflict and consider how we might apply them to personal, work, community and literary conflicts through lecture, small group work, role playing, reading, various written projects, and discussion."
