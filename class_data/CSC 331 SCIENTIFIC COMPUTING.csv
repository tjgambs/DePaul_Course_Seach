CSC 331 SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING
"This course presents fundamental numerical algorithms for solving problems in scientific computing and computational finance. Areas covered include: error analysis, computer arithmetic, linear algebra, optimization problems, numerical integration (solvers), ordinary differential equations (ODE). The emphasis of the course is on the design of the algorithms, and their analysis. Algorithms will be implemented using mathematical software. PREREQUISITE(S): (CSC 212 or CSC 262 or CSC 224 or CSC 300) , and 2 course calculus sequence or instructor's permission."
