PRF 532 GRADUATE VOICE AND SPEECH I
"Foundation work consists of breathwork, skeletal alignment, and the development of free voice flow.  Classes include a regime of intensive group exercises, and attention is paid to the expansion of each actor's individual expressiveness.  The fundamental work is inspired by the Feldenkrais(r) and the Lessac System and is further influenced by the writings of Cicely Berry and Patsy Rodenburg."
