SW 160 CLIMATE AND CLIMATE CHANGE
"Climate impacts every moment of our lives.  We are, in fact, dependent for survival upon climatic conditions remaining within certain rather narrow ranges of the possible variation.  However, for the past ten millennia climate has been comfortable enough to permit the rise (and fall) of many civilizations.  Climate stability over the last 4,500 years has permitted us to invent cities and engage in agriculture and hydraulic engineering, science, and many other activities which we recognize as civilized and like to think of as advances.  However, in an extremely short period of time, only two centuries, we have reached a stage of interaction with the climate which jeopardizes the very regularities in climate on which we depend. 

In order to understand what our options are we must learn to understand the climate system within large interacting frameworks of geography, geology, chemistry, physics, and ecology over long spans of time.  This level of complexity urgently calls on us humans for an exploration of a robust Earth-oriented ethic.  In this course we will build from simple observations to more complex understandings and the exploration of possible futures with scenario thinking.  We will engage in discussion around lectures illustrated with power point, texts, and current developments reported in scientific journals, contemporary press, and on the web."
