CSL 451 LEGAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES IN COUNSELING
"Professional counseling involves interplay of ethics, personal values and legal implications of practice. A core component of the course is a focus on how personal values intersect with ethical decision-making.  Ethical codes and ethical decision-making models related to the profession are studied so that the students will have the knowledge of professional ethical practice. An examination of local and federal laws in relation to the previously mentioned components will be examined. Students engage in case conceptualization, small group activities, role-playing with lectures, and video technology."
