PE 317 PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
"The course is designed to promote an understanding of the contribution that physical education makes to the elementary school curriculum and the development of the whole child. Lesson planning, instructional delivery, assessment of learning and classroom management will be focused as students engage in 15-20 hours of supervised field experience teaching whole classes of children in local schools.  This course is for Physical Education majors only; however, EE majors will be considered if the course is needed for student teaching in the subsequent quarter."
