HAA 231 EARLY MEDIEVAL ART
"This course treats the art of the early Medieval period, which spans the fourth to the eleventh centuries CE and includes Roman, Celtic, Gothic, Merovingian, Anglo-Saxon, Carolingian, Viking, and Ottonian cultures. In thinking about factors such as historical context, dynamics of production, and audience, we will come to understand the role of art and architecture in announcing power and extent of territory, staging public rituals, proclaiming social status, inspiring faith, and accommodating the dead."
