MKT 382 PRINCIPLES OF CATEGORY MANAGEMENT
"Successful companies expect their suppliers to act as partners that will help them grow their businesses, not simply to trade share among competitors. Relationships are established between buyer and seller when vendor partners demonstrate and leverage business understanding to build customer volume. In consumer packaged goods, this practice is known as category management. The course is taught through the case method to learn the category management process, use the information systems and data resources available and develop sales presentations that effectively communicate solutions for business problems in three different industries."
