PHL 247 PHILOSOPHY AND THE VALUE OF MUSIC
"In this course, we will explore the philosophical dimensions of music, in particular, the value of music, both as a tool in the development of character and as a tool of social and political change. The examination of the value of music will involve us in an examination of music as an idea and of how we come to an understanding of the meaning of music."
