IN 364 PLANNING DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
"Chicago and some of its older communities have benefited from enlightened planning, layout, and design.  Following a review of planning examples, principles and design theory, students will select a current planning activity or design development strategy and will detail plan goals, objectives and anticipated results.  Students will identify opportunities for public involvement in the planning process to gain greater insight into public decision-making and the power of individual initiative."
