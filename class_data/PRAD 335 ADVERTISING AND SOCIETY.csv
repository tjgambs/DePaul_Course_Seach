PRAD 335 ADVERTISING AND SOCIETY
"This course challenges students to think critically about the societal effect of public relations and advertising with regard to their roles in the production and maintenance of consumer culture and the formation of public opinion. Students read widely from a body of social criticism that may diminish democracy and endanger our collective public life. This course asks future practitioners to confront the uses and abuses of public relations and advertising, and to understand the negative social consequences that can result."
