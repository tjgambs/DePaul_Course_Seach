ANI 321 ANIMATION MECHANICS
"Students in this course will rigorously investigate the foundational aspects of animation through traditional and digital methods.  Basic principles, including timing, spacing and the abstraction of movement, will be analyzed and questioned through experimentation.  Students will experience how the process of making work can be used to generate emergent ideas, and be challenged to push the art form beyond the accepted conventions. PREREQUISITE(S): None"
