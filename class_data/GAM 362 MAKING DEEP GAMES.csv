GAM 362 MAKING DEEP GAMES
"This workshop investigates the process of designing games about the human condition. It specifically focuses on the potential of games to tackle profound and abstract ideas (e.g. loyalty, dignity, courage and trust) by way of metaphor and analogy. Assignments will explore metaphorical games, games for persuasion and games for self-expression. Special emphasis is placed on the analysis of personal experiences and how they can be translated systematically into game designs that generate non-typical gameplay content.  PREREQUISITE(S): GAM 226 or GAM 224"
