The topics of idea generation, experimentation, problem solving, planning and time management, and the process of critical analysis will be applied to the students work, with the choice of animation technique, content and form left to the individual.  We will have technical demonstrations on an as-needed basis, depending on the nature of your animations.  This course must be taken consecutively with ANI 541 Animated Short Film Part II.  PREREQUISITE(S): ANI 440"
