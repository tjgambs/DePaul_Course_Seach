ART 321 INTERMEDIATE DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY
"This course builds on Art 224, further emphasizing the aesthetic and conceptual possibilities of digital photography. Through project-based experimentation, students deepen their critical engagement with photographic tools while producing conceptually driven bodies of work. Refined use of the DSLR camera and editing tools takes place through hands-on image production and process-oriented critique. Additionally, this course explores historically established uses of the photographic medium and their relation in the digital context."
