INT 204 CULTURAL ANALYSIS
"This course asks students to examine economic and cultural practices together so as to see the complicated ways in which such practices intersect and/or give rise to one another. Drawing on a variety of materialist perspectives, students study the economic and cultural instrumentality that different family structures and constructions of sexuality, gender, and race have held across time and place and how and why such structures have changed. Students also analyze the cultural logic of disposability in capitalism, both in terms of garbage-generation and the generation of surplus populations."
