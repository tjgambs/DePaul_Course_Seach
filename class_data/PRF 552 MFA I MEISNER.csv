PRF 552 MFA I MEISNER
"Sanford Meisner said, ""Acting is the ability to live truthfully under imaginary circumstances."" In this first of a two quarter sequence, actors will participate in a sequence of structured improvisational exercises focused on the first half of that sentence: living truthfully. The foundational exercise is called Repetition. Using Repetition as a base, students will explore exercises specifically designed to improve their listening and answering skills and increase their ability to respond to their partner moment to moment."
