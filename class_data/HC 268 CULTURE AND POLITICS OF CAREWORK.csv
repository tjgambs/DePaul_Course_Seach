HC 268 CULTURE AND POLITICS OF CAREWORK
"In this class we will discuss the different meanings and realities of ?carework,? and the social and economic values attached to it. We will examine how the responsibilities and expectations regarding carework are unevenly distributed over different social populations, how gender, race, nationality, or culture figure into this distribution as well as specific labor conditions. By imagining a society that values carework, and that is founded on an ethic of care and justice we will also look at different forms of political or civic engagement that are based on an ethic of care and justice. In particular, we will examine the different strategies and objectives of political movements, labor advocacy groups, and people working on policy changes. The class will be taught in the form of a learning circle, giving students the opportunity to practice principles of restorative justice while being engaged in collaborative learning processes."
