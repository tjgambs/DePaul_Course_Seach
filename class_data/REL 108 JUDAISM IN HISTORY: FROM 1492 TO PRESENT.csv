REL 108 JUDAISM IN HISTORY: FROM 1492 TO PRESENT
"The purpose of this course is to provide a basic understanding of Judaism as the historic and evolving religious expression of the Jewish people. It seeks to provide students an entree into the world of Jewish religious and historical experience and to help them develop a conceptual understanding of the thought and practice that underlies the Jewish worldview. It also seeks to examine certain continuities and discontinuities in the conception of Judaism as reflected in selected texts which express the full range of Jewish religious and national creativity. Among the topics to be discussed are the complex relations of Jewish thinkers to the surrounding non-Jewish cultures, and how these interactions affected the Jews understanding of Judaism. The approach to this material will be intellectual-historical. The course is designed as the second part of a two-course sequence on the history of Judaism from the Bible to the present. It focuses on the history of Jewish tradition from the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492 to the present."
