FIN 501 ETHICS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
"This seminar course will examine both ethical issues and conflicts of interest that face financial decision makers in today's business world.  The class will feature case studies and guest speakers as the key teaching tools, supplemented by short lectures and student simulations/exercises.  Each class period will be devoted to a different contest in which to consider topical issues.  We will look at and discuss ethical issues facing financial services companies, corporates (both public and private), as well as not for profits.  We will examine these issues, where applicable and relevant, from multiple perspectives: Board of Directors, Executive Management, Shareholders, Regulators, Suppliers and Customers, Competitors, Employees and Communities.  Some of the discussion will purposefully consider the additional realities of differing culture and values in the international context."
