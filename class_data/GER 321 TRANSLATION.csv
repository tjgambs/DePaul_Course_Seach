GER 321 TRANSLATION
"The primary objective of this course is to immerse the student in the process of translation from German into English (and to a lesser extent from English into German) to successfully complete a variety of translation projects for professional, academic, artistic, or personal purposes, thus equipping the students with proficiency in translating at an advanced level. Through various translation assignments, students will be able to review German grammar, work within different registers and learn appropriate vocabulary, expand their reading and writing in German while developing a sense of responsibility for the text translated. This course will present a survey of translation theory, particularly as it relates to Germany, and probe the usefulness of technology. GER 106 or equivalent, including placement test or permission of instructor, is recommended."
