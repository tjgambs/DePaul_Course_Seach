GER 102 BASIC GERMAN II
"GER 102 is the second quarter of the first-year college German sequence. It continues to introduce the students to the study of language and culture of German speaking countries. The course focuses on the development of all four critical language skills--listening, reading, writing and speaking--while also introducing aspects of German-speaking societies that differ from American society. In-class work will be devoted primarily to communication activities, so that students will be able to utilize the structures and vocabulary to express themselves meaningfully and to function in a German-speaking setting.To maximize each student's engagement with the language, students will be talking and listening to each other as much as to the instructor. At the end of the three-course sequence, students will be in command of the basic elements of German language and culture, and should be able to function with relative ease in German-speaking countries. Students will be able to comprehend and engage in basic conversations, write clearly and effectively in German, and read simple but genuine texts."
