"This course analyzes the historic competition between candidates, the media, and presidential campaigns. It examines how public understanding of political issues, public policy, and the candidates is created. We'll drill down into conditions that lead to a cooperative or adversarial press in campaign reporting and how the public perceives the political process and the role of the press in forming public opinion in presidential campaigns and during presidencies."
