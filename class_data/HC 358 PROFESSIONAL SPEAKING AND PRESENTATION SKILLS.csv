HC 358 PROFESSIONAL SPEAKING AND PRESENTATION SKILLS
"Speaking in public remains on the top ten list of ""worst fears."" This course is designed to give students an opportunity to move through these fears and build their skills as speakers in various settings. Through exercises and presentations students will build their skills in formal and informal speech.  Students will prepare a variety of presentations,  including impromptu, persuasive, informative, and motivational.  Through class feedback, students will build their presentation skills and organizational techniques, topic development, delivery, and use of visuals.  Students will videotape their progress.  Students will discover that the way they present themselves often means the difference between inspiring confidence or apathy.   Students will also review the historical and contemporary work of effective speakers."
