AI 232 THEATER IMPROVISATION
"In this course we will play on the classroom stage as we might have played on the playground as kids.  The difference between these forms of play is one of degree rather than one of kind.  A theater game provides a structure in which we can play spontaneously.  In other words, we improvise.  Improvisation aids in the developing of public speaking skills and comfort and confidence as well as other social and theatrical skills. May be taken for only one competence."
