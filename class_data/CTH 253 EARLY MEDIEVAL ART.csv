CTH 253 EARLY MEDIEVAL ART
"This course explores the art of the Medieval period from a broad range of cultures: Early Christian, Byzantine, Islamic, Carolingian, and Ottonian. We will discuss major stylistic trends and explore the relationship between art, culture, and religion. Works of art will be evaluated in terms of their social functions in the societies that produced them and our analysis will incorporate the perspectives of both the producers (patrons, artists) and consumers of art. Cross-listed as HAA 231."
