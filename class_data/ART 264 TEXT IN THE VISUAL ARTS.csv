ART 264 TEXT IN THE VISUAL ARTS
"Students are introduced to the fundamentals of text including layout, hierarchy and the basic characteristics of letter-forms and type families; in addition to conceptually driven experimentation with typographic form in relation to the fine and media arts, including painting, drawing, photography (digital and analog), photomontage as well as video and time-based arts. Projects employ both handwork and computer technology and address the two-dimensional surface as well as type in three-dimensional space and time-based art."
