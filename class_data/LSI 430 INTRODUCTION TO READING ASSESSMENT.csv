LSI 430 INTRODUCTION TO READING ASSESSMENT
"This course introduces students to the foundational concepts of reading assessment, with an emphasis on the multiple roles of assessment in today's schools: to evaluate, to classify, and to guide instruction. Students will be introduced to formal and informal measures of reading achievement and development, and will have scaffolded opportunities to administer, interpret, and use results for instructional planning. Additional topics to be covered include characteristics of informal and formal assessment (e.g., test construction, reliability and validity, and non-discriminatory testing), and the roles of assessment in the diagnosis and identification of reading disabilities. Students will be introduced to case report writing to deepen their understanding of reading difficulties as well as to clearly communicate assessment findings to a variety of individuals, including parents."
