DC 125 DIGITAL STILL PHOTOGRAPHY FOR NON-MAJORS
"This course is an introduction to the history and aesthetics of still photography and to the concept of photography as a descriptive and interpretive artistic medium.  Students studying photographs in this context will discover relationships between individual photographers' choices and their own understanding of meaning.  Discussions of  the photos' cultural contexts and meanings will deepen their understanding of the role of still photography as a conduit for cultural values. 

Students will learn the fundamental concepts necessary to shoot, edit, manipulate, and print digital still photographs.  Also, students will acquire the knowledge needed to analyze and critique existing work.  Students will be required to use their own digital still cameras for this course."
