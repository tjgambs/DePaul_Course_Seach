LSP 200 SEMINAR ON MULTICULTURALISM IN THE UNITED STATES
"This course provides the opportunity for students to learn about some dimension of multiculturalism relevant to the United States, as considered in the context of the global community. Multiculturalism includes questions of ethnicity, race, class, gender, language, religion, and sexual orientation. Courses pay attention to the history of multiculturalism; examine the experiences and perspectives of at least three distinct cultural groups; develop a critical perspective about meanings of multiculturalism; and investigate the historical roots of inequalities related to differences in class, ethnicity, gender, age, language, religion, ability, and sexual orientation. Topics of seminars vary and students select a course that interests them. Students can complete only one course numbered LSP 200.  Formerly ISP 200."
