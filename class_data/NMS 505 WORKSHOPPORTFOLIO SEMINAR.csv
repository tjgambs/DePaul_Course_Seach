NMS 505 WORKSHOP/PORTFOLIO SEMINAR
"Students will have a choice between a collaborative workshop or a more individually-centered portfolio development seminar. Each group prepares a digital media project for an existing community group, such as a social service organization. Those students preferring to work independently will, under the guidance of the advising professor, develop and defend a complete portfolio of their work within the NMS program. May be repeated for elective credit."
