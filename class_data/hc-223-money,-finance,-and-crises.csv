"HC 223 MONEY, FINANCE, AND CRISES"
"Money has become such an integral part of our everyday life that we take its everyday use, whether physically or electronically, for granted. Yet the reach of money goes far beyond what we experience. Money is much more involved in the inner workings of the economy through the interaction of financial markets (bond markets, stock markets, foreign exchange markets, etc.) and financial institutions (banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds, etc.). Financial markets and institutions everywhere, and particularly in the U.S., influence the trillions of dollars that flow daily worldwide. Their impact on the welfare of nations and on the capacity of the economy to produce goods and services becomes evident when one looks at the Great Recession, which started in 2008. The goal of this course is to provide a working understanding of many issues through the study of money, banking, and financial markets."
