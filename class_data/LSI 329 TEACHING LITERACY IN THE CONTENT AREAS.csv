LSI 329 TEACHING LITERACY IN THE CONTENT AREAS
"This course addresses the integration of reading, writing, and oral language into the content areas (with a focus on English/language arts and history/social studies). Candidates learn to assess the reading needs of students in content area courses and to design, select, modify, and evaluate a wide range of materials for the content areas. The course goes beyond teaching a set of isolated generic reading comprehension skills and provides strategies that can be applied across content areas to prepare diverse, at-risk, and exceptional students to read, write, talk, and think critically about complex texts, and to develop positive literacy identities. Attention is given to incorporating Common Core standards and IEP goals into instruction."
