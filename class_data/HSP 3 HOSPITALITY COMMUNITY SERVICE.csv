HSP 3 HOSPITALITY COMMUNITY SERVICE
"To support the Vincentian mission of DePaul and to demonstrate mastery of hospitality concepts, students are to engage in one (1) community service event during their senior year on a voluntary basis.  The event must be sponsored by a non-profit organization and the student is to contribute his or her hospitality knowledge and skills toward the production of the event. The event or organization sponsoring it does not have to be in the hospitality industry, but the activity must be hospitality in nature."
