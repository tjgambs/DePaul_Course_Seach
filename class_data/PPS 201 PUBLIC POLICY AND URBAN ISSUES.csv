PPS 201 PUBLIC POLICY AND URBAN ISSUES
"This core course is designed to introduce students to the study of urban areas, to some of the more exciting and difficult issues faced by cities, and finally, to some of the policies designed to address these issues. Readings assist students in exploring what makes cities function, how they have changed over time and what it was like to live through those changes, can show us how modern ways of seeing and modern ways of making sense came into being. If  student is a PPS major, then students are encouraged to take PPS 200 prior to PPS 201."
