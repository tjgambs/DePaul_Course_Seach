"ACC 636 INTERNAL AUDITING, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND INTERNAL CONTROL"
"This course addresses the overall role that internal audit plays as a critical part of an organization's control and governance structure.  The content of the course includes a case that incorporates the complete internal audit process for a hypothetical company, including identification of risk, planning, execution of fieldwork and reporting using CCH TeamMate software.  This course covers the strategic role and operations of an internal audit function from three key perspectives; the Chief Audit Executive, who is responsible for the functions, the chair of the audit committee, who oversees the function, and the CEO or CFO who is responsible for the function within the organization.
