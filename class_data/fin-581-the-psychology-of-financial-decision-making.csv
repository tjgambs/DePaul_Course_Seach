FIN 581 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF FINANCIAL DECISION MAKING
"This course studies the various behavioral strategies that people rely upon to make financial decisions. The course starts with a review of psychological research on intuitive judgment, belief formation, learning, memory, utility theory, risk attitudes, and choice over time. The course introduces concepts such as framing, heuristics, self-control, and conformity. These ideas are illustrated with practical applications to saving decisions, entrepreneurship, trust between financial advisors and their clients, and decision-making in groups. Class discussions are based on academic research."
