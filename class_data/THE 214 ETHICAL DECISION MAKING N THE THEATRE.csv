THE 214 ETHICAL DECISION MAKING N THE THEATRE
"Ethical decisions are a challenging part of every profession.  Ethical Decision-Making in the Theatre assumes two basic questions:  What is an ethical decision, and why is ethics of particular resonance for theatre professionals?  Through readings, writing assignments, and class discussions, this course will work to define ethics by examining examples of both ethical and unethical behavior, will examine the ethical role that theatre plays in our society, and will debate the responsibilities that we carry into the profession as theatre artists and professionals.  Through group work we will determine a framework for ethical thinking and will apply this framework to specific situations facing the theatre profession today, ultimately determining whether or not the result is an ethical decision."
