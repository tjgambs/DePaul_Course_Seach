JOUR 513 CHICAGO AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS REPORTING
"This course analyzes what is distinctive about Chicago reporting. Students will be introduced to the rich tradition and history of reporting in this city, and the central role this work has played in the development of urban reporting nationwide. To do this, students will take a close look at the institutions, people, neighborhoods, decision-makers and events that impact Chicago residents in their everyday lives. The emphasis will be on localizing our approach to stories through a beat system that will allow students to regularly report on important areas of municipal life."
